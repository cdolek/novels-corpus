THE ANGLO-IRISH. 



CHAPTER I. 

The following appeared among the notices 
of ** Deaths'" in a London Magazine for 18 — . 

** At his mansion in Grosvenor-square, the 
Viscount Clangore, aged forty-six. His Lord- 
ship was only son of the late Viscount. Part- 
ly through his co-operation in Ireland with 
a highly-gifted fellow-countryman, now enno- 
bled, and almost at the head of the English 
Cabinet, his Lordship became at an early age 
a distinguished Irish politician. The states- 
man alluded to delivered to the Irish House 
of Commons, in his twenty-second year, his re- 
markable oration, supporting Ireland's claim to 
trade with India on free principles : Lord Clan- 
gore's maiden speech in the Irish House of

Lords, at little more than the same age, imme- 
diately and ably seconded him; and from this 
circumstance may be dated the political alli- 
ance between both, now dissolved only by the 
lamented demise of his Lordship. 

" When experience of the dangerous ten- 
dency of Irish sentiments in favour of the 
pernicious principles of the French Revolution, 
soon after convinced the youthful commoner 
that he had erred in enlisting himself in the 
ranks of those who were called popular ora- 
tors ; and when, in consequence, he appeared, 
in 1795, as a zealous supporter of Lord Cam- 
den''s Irish Government, his noble admirer, 
the subject of our obituary, did not long he- 
sitate to give proofs of a similar correction of 
opinion. 

*' Indeed, Lord Clangore was one of the few 
of his countrymen who, in the almost boyish 
dehut of the aspirant, discovered the promise 
of that ability and wisdom which have since 
wielded, with consummate power and address, 
the destinies of Europe ; and, although having 
the advantage in rank, and, by a few years, in 
age, of the object of his sagacious interest, 
his Lordship may be said to have even then 
deferred to the commanding intellect, that he 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 8 

foresaw needed only the countenance of the 
high and influential, to confer on all his Ma- 
jesty's subjects of Great Britain, as well as of 
Ireland, solid advantages and unrivalled glory. 

" Realizing his Lordship's views, the Honour- 
able Mr. Stewart quickly obtained a seat in the 
Irish Cabinet, and during the succession of dif- 
ficulties which the young Minister had to en- 
counter, from the Irish Rebellion of 1798, down 
to the felicitous moment when he effected the 
Legislative Union between his native country 
and Great Britain, he found no political friend 
more faithful, and few more valuable, than Lord 
Clangore. The firm course pursued by His 
Majesty's Vice-regal administration, in suppress- 
ing the ill-judged insurrection alluded to, is 
sufficiently well known; but it was his Lord- 
ship's fate, in conjunction with his distinguished 
protege, to have his motives on that occasion 
somewhat misrepresented. Of the cruelties 
which marked the times, both are charged with 
having being the instigators. But surely a mi- 
nister or his friends are not accountable for all 
the excesses that characterise civil warfare. Be- 
•ides, the minister was then, as will be recollected, 
very young ; and as well might he have hoped 
to still the tempest with his voice, as to have

assuaged the vengeance and violence of either 
party. 

" Of the share which his Lordship had in 
effecting the Irish Union, he might safely boast 
as the most important event of his public life. 
The soundness and excellence of his private 
as well as political character, are evinced in 
his unchangeable attachment, through good and 
ill, to the fortunes of his now illustrious survi- 
vor. After the transit of that eminent indivi- 
dual from the Irish to the United Parliament, 
and (in consequence of his able support of Mr. 
Pitt) after his nomination, in 1805, to the Bri- 
tish Cabinet, the Viscount Clangore shared with 
him all the ministerial fluctuations for which 
the two ensuing years were remarkable ; until, 
in 1807, on the retirement of the Grey and 
Grenville administration, his Lordship had the 
gratification to see him created Minister of 
War ; and finally, notwithstanding a renewed 
deprivation of office, to witness, upon the la- 
mented death of Mr. Perceval in 1812, the 
elevation of the object of his early patronage, 
and we may add, good augury, to the high 
office he at present fills with so much honour to 
himself, and triumph to these favoured islands. 

" In the difference, and consequent duel, be- 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 5 

twcen the now great minister and Mr. Canning, 
still fresh in the public mind, it may be added, 
as an evidence of the personal friendship of 
the former towards his noble countryman, that, 
through the progress of that interesting event. 
Lord Clangore's judgment was not unconsult- 
ed. But perhaps, the strongest proof of this 
friendship is to be stated. Conjointly with a per- 
sonage almost equally illustrious, though in a 
different career, as also with a near relative of 
the late Viscount, residing in Ireland, the most 
successful minister England ever saw, has ac- 
cepted the guardianship of Lord Clangore's 
children, two sons and a daughter, now, by 
their father's death, left without the care of a 
parent ; their noble mother having died in 18 — , 
as a reference to our number for the month of 

in that year will show. 

" Although possessing heraldic claims as 
strong perhaps, if they were defined, as many 
Anglo-Irish families, the Viscount Clangore 
evinced, during his useful life, little anxiety 
for a proved and emblazoned pedigree of any 
great extent, willing to rest his ancestral pride 
chiefly upon the successful bravery, in Ireland, 
of a soldier of the Commonwealth, who, after 
the Restoration, had conBrmed to him the con- 



« THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

flscated Irish property won by his courage and 
talents from the crimes and turbulence of the 
natives, and from the admiration and gratitude 
of the Protector. Similar good services ren- 
dered by the immediate successor of this distin- 
guished individual to William III. during that 
monarch's campaigns against the mere Irish 
abettors of his infatuated father-in-law, enno- 
bled the family. The late Viscount's efficient 
support of His Majesty's Government, as well 
in England as in Ireland, enabled him to add 
to his patrimonial inheritance a considerable 
estate, purchased in this country ; and fame 
informs us, that his Lordship's advance in the 
peerage could only have been checked by the 
melancholy event which it is our painful duty 
to record." 



In a short time after the appearance of this 
obituary, measures were taken by the guardians 
of the late Viscount's children, to make an ar- 
rangement for their future career and happi- 
ness. The eldest son, in his nineteenth year, 
and the second, a boy of fourteen, had been 
summoned, immediately upon their father's 
death, which was unexpected, to the town house 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 7 

of a maternal relation, the one from Cambridge, 
the other from Westminster, to attend, after a 
proper season of retirement, a consultation of 
their legal parents. Their sister, about thir- 
teen, could not safely join them. Nursed by 
the lady of the third guardian named in Lord 
Clangore's will, she was residing, at the recom- 
mendation of a medical authority, on the coast 
of Devonshire ; and, especially upon such an 
occasion, it seemed injudicious to remove her to 
London. 

The husband of her present protectress was 
a second cousin of the noble testator, whom in 
early youth the Viscount had noticed, but who, 
within the last eventful ten years, had gradually 
slipped out of the list of his Lordship's intimate 
acquaintances : perhaps, having lived since the 
Irish Union in different countries, this circum" 
stance was as much the result of chance as of 
intention on the part of either. Lord Clangore 
never admitted that the fact of Mr. Knightly 
having voted in the Irish House of Commons 
against the measure, which thus separated them, 
changed his private feelings towards his old 
friend ; and although their personal intercourse 
soon ended, and few letters passed between the 
resident Irish squire and the absent Anglo- 



8 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

Irish nobleman, Mr. Knightly, on his part, sel- 
dom missed any opportunity of promoting, in 
a neighbourly way, the Viscount's local Irish 
interests. 

Soon after the decease of Lady Clangore, her 
only daughter showed symptoms of the nation- 
al malady which had hurried herself out of the 
world, and was ordered to remove, under the 
care of an affectionate nurse, from a London 
atmosphere. The afflicted father, scarce able to 
snatch from official labour as much time as was 
necessary for considering the subject, looked 
round in vain, amongst the few English con- 
nexions he had made by his marriage, in the 
hope of selecting an individual at once compe- 
tent and willing to protect and comfort his 
child in the salutary exile to which she was 
doomed. In his dilemma he recollected that in 
the person of Knightly''s wife, whose domestic 
character, even at an early age, he had remark- 
ed, there appeared one eminently fitted (could 
she temporarily forego the superintendence ol 
her own family) to undertake the task ; and, 
deciding to make the trial, he wrote to his old 
acquaintance. Knightly answered the letter by 
a visit, for the first time in his life, to London, 
accompanied by his lady ; the next day, Ladj 



THE ANGLO-IRISH, § 

Augusta Blount proceeded to Devonshire under 
Mrs. Knightly's protection ; and the next, not- 
withstanding the persuasions of the grateful 
father to lengthen his stay in Grosvenor Square, 
Knightly himself bustled back to Ireland. 

Lord Clangore, somewhat piqued at the ab- 
ruptness of his Irish cousin, almost regretted 
that he had accepted such an obligation at 
Mr. Knightly's hands. He was grateful for 
the act, but not conciliated by the method of 
doing it. " ""Tis the thing, but 'tis not the 
manner of the thing," soliloquized his Lord- 
ship. And he proceeded to reflect, that either 
Knightly was much changed for the worse, 
since their parting in 1800, or that, remaining 
stationary as Lord Clangore had left him, the 
improved ideas of manner and character, which 
the Viscount had gradually acquired in Eng- 
lish society, now laid open to detection many 
disagreeable peculiarities of the thorough Irish 
squire. WilUng, however, to manifest a con- 
tinued sense of gratitude, he wrote, during the 
course of the ensuing year, while Lady Au- 
gusta still remained in Devonshire, several let- 
ters to Knightly, pressing him to re-visit Lon- 
don, and also to name in what way an influential 
friend could promote his welfare. But to some 
B 5 



10 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

of these letters Mr. Knightly returned hasty 
and brief refusals of all the honours intended for 
him, and others he left unanswered. 

Lord Clangore felt, not without reason, in- 
creased chagrin, and would have removed his 
daughter from Mrs. Knightly's care, if Lady 
Augusta's strong and quickly formed affection 
for her nurse had permitted the measure. 

But to his sons he failed not to criticise, as it 
justly seemed to merit, this (as he called it) 
mere Irish pride ; intemperately, and, perhaps, 
enviously cherished, and clownishly expressed. 
From their infancy, it had been his study to 
impress upon his children the necessity of em- 
bracing all that the superior country proposed 
for adoption ; and in the abrupt conduct of 
their Irish relative, appeared new and practical 
reasons why they should avoid imitating a se- 
condary standard of propriety. 

Fully agreeing with their parent, and, per- 
haps, even going beyond his views on the sub- 
ject, his two sons could feel little less than per- 
sonal indifference to Knightly, if not dislike of 
that gentleman. It was, therefore, with much 
surprise that they learned the name of the 
third guardian appointed, by Lord Clangore's 
will, to preside over their minority. Mental 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 11 

weakness, the accompaniment of sudden and 
increasing malady, alone seemed to account for 
the appointing to such a trust a person for 
whom they knew his Lordship to have enter- 
tained no respect, and, notwithstanding an 
early friendship, scarce any esteem'. To unite 
in common authority with a prime minister, 
and one of the first generals of his age, a rugged 
country-gentleman from the wilds of Ireland, 
also seemed very grotesque ; and in fact, the 
young Viscount and his brother, the Honour- 
able Gerald Blount, awaited in no favour- 
able anticipations the official meeting with their 
yet unseen cousin. 

Mr. Knightly, though speedily apprised of 
Lord Clangore's death, repaired on no mission 
of condolence to London. A formal intimation 
of the day appointed for the consultation of all 
the guardians seemed necessary to force him 
out of his beloved Ireland. Even when that 
was sent in time to allow of a leisurely journey, 
and some days to spare before the conference, 
his non-appearance, almost on the eve of the 
appointed morning, caused some annoyance, and 
created a very unfavourable impression. Just 
saving his distance, however, separate notes 
addressed to his brother-guardians, and to his 



1* THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

noble young kinsmen, late on the very last 
evening, when he could not, without glaring 
impropriety, have continued silent, announced 
liis arrival in town " at the Saracen's Head, 
Snowhill;" and farther, requested information 
as to the exact hour, next day, appointed for 
his appearance in St. James's Square ; for there, 
at the mansion of the minister, he was to pre- 
sent himself. His wards allowed his notes to 
remain unanswered ; and indeed his whole cor- 
respondence was recognized only by a line of 
studied official politeness from the Minister's 
private secretary, expressive of the pleasure 
with which he would be received, at nine o'clock 
the ensuing morning, when all parties concerned 
in the business in hand were expected to meet 
at breakfast. 

Nine o'clock the ensuing morning was strik- 
ing by the splendid timepiece over the man- 
tel of the Minister's library ; and he, the next- 
named guardian. General Sir Robert Flood, 
and the brothers. Lord Clangore and the 
Honourable Gerald Blount, stood listening for 
the breaking-up of the aristocratic silence of 
the Square abroad, by the expected rattle of 
Mr. Knightly 's carriage ; but no such sound 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 15 

met their ears. Ere the silvery strokes had com- 
pleted the prescribed number, the fine and 
bland face of the now ennobled statesman 
turned to the bronzed visage of his gallant 
countryman, and during the glance which they 
interchanged, a smile of mild contempt of the 
obscure person who could break such an ap- 
pointment, escaped the one, and a slight quick 
frown tlie other. The eyes of the young bro- 
thers also met ; Lord Clangore, from his su- 
perior years, exhibiting for the schoolboy's 
response the displeasure he took no pains to 
conceal. 

But, as has been said, this happened whilst 
the hour was striking, and, such are the chances 
of life, proved, by a second or two, an anticipa- 
tion : for, almost simultaneously with the ninth 
stroke of the timepiece, although no rattling 
wheels or clattering hoofs — (St. James's Square 
was not macadamized then) — had heralded his 
approach, a kind of postman's double-knock 
smote the hall-door, and presently a footman, 
magnificently liveried, ushered into the library, 
by the name of Knightly, a strong and square- 
built person, about the middle stature, having 
a broad-featured, horny face, and a dark small

eye, wearing his coal-black hair smoothed down 
over his forehead, a brown surtout, although 
it was a warm April-day, half-buttoned over a 
bright blue coat, and smiling and carrying his 
hat protectingly in his hand. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 15 



CHAPTER II. 

Of the persons of this scene the schoolboy is 
my hero, and I shall therefore transcribe his 
impressions of it. 

Gerald, then, at the mere appearance of 
his third-named guardian, painfully felt the 
contrast between his unfashionable, though re- 
spectable dress and mien, and the tall figure of 
the Minister, clad in a silken and richly-flowered 
morning-gown, as, advancing a step, he grace- 
fully returned the loose, abrupt bow of Mr. 
Knightly. The frank military politeness of Sir 
Robert Flood, and the air of his straight person, 
neatly expressed in a blue undress frock, braid- 
ed and buttoned up to his chin, produced ano- 
ther contrast, as he and Knightly greeted each 
other, equally unfavourable to the Irish squire. 
In turn, the visitor was named to Lord Clan- 
gore, and Gerald noticed the bare civility of 
his brother's recognition. In some surprise, 
however, he remarked the final issue of their 
meeting. 



16 THE ANGLO IRISH. 

Knightly, after his second butting bow to the 
General, turned quickly, with outstretched hand, 
and some modification of his set smile, to his 
titled ward ; the young nobleman all but step- 
ped back, and not withdrawing his eyes from 
the other's face, as if to form a reason for not 
seeing his hand, just inclined his chin towards 
his breast, whereat Mr. Knightly checked him- 
self, looked askance, tried to imitate the polite 
nod, new-fashioned to him, with which he was 
received, — and, during the attempt, Gerald 
thought that a slight but bitter smile darted 
out of the corners of his mouth and of his half- 
closed lids. Could this uncouth gentleman feel, 
or rather affect to feel, any unbecoming senti- 
ment towards Gerald's brother ? But he was 
not able to conclude his mental question, when 
the subject of it suddenly wheeled round upon 
himself, and, not waiting for formal presentation 
to the schoolboy, or giving him time to stand 
on his guard, plunged on both his hands, and, 
with strong and overcharged language, ex- 
pressed his joy at seeing him. 

All proceeded to the breakfast parlour, Mr. 
Knightly still keeping firm hold of his new hat ; 
and, ere he would occupy the chair pointed out 
to him, he bethought himself of walking quickly 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. IT 

across the room, and depositing it on a side-table. 
As he returned to his chair, a servant, removing 
it to the hall, called from him a questioning 
glance ; and though, at length, he seated him- 
self quietly, and with somewhat of the self- 
possession of a gentleman, Gerald smiled to ob- 
serve the grave scrutiny with which he peered 
at (so Gerald thought) the flame lighted under 
a richly-embossed chocolate-pot. 

" Peter Bell," whispered Lord Clangore to 
his brother, who sat close by him ; "he carries 
all the out-of-doors character of Peter in his 
face ; and has he tied his ass to the railings.?" 

*' Caliban," answered Gerald, " the marks of 
his talons are on my hands.'''' 

" Observe him now, Gerald," as Mr. Knightly 
took a steady survey of the dishes round the 
table; " attend, and you may see 

* The longings of the Cannibal arise. 
Although he speaks not, in his wolfish eyes.' " 

And allowing for some poetical license, the 
quotation seemed not misapplied. After de- 
clining, but not till he caused his host to repeat 
its name, to be helped to Perigord-pie, Mr. 
Knightly demanded what was a round, en- 
crusted, disguised something, in the middle of 



18 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

the board. At the answer " smoked tongue," 
his countenance brightened, and he zealously 
put in his claim for some to the General, and at 
the same time plied Lord Clangore, who pre- 
sided over a pair of cold fowls. And over 
and over again he would be helped to both to- 
gether ; and between his pauses, having tea to 
his hand, cup after cup slaked his insatiate 
thirst — it was prodigious. Once he seemed to 
relax, and an attendant motioned to change 
his plate ; but the sudden way in which Mr. 
Knightly seized, and, with an earnest " beg 
your pardon," — detained it, smiling to himself 
all the time, startled and amused, at once, the 
two junior spectators. 

Catching Gerald's eye during his serious 
occupation, Mr. Knightly smiled more expres- 
sively than ever, and seemed to think there 
might exist some slight necessity for palliation. 
" Ay, my honourable young cousin," he said, 
" when you come to see us in Ireland, this is 
the way we '11 teach you to breakfast : first 
teaching you that a couple of hours' walk before 
hand is indispensable in the case: I have just 
been rambling over Primrose Hill as far as 
Highgate." 

" My brother thanks you, Sir," said Lord 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 19 

Clangore, after exchanging a glance with Gerald, 
'* and when he goes to see you in Ireland, will 
most gladly become your pupil." 

Gerald, not quite so fully possessed with a feel- 
ing of equality towards men of matured years 
as was his Lordship, feared this irony might 
prove too strong ; he comforted himself, how- 
ever, with the hope that it would not be under- 
stood ; and, indeed, the quiet " You are very 
good, my Lord," with which Mr. Knightly re- 
plied, set him at ease. 

" Over Primrose-hill, and on to Highgate !" 
said the Minister, smiling : " indeed, Mr. 
Knightly, you astound us poor cockneys." 

*' I fear so, my Lord ; but Irish mountaineers 
will follow their old habits." 

" No doubt," said Sir Robert. " Are they 
getting any quieter, Mr. Knightly .''" 

It was a quick turn of the conversation, yet 
Mr. Knightly's " No, indeed, General," showed 
that he accepted it quite in course. 

" Unhappy, misguided creatures," continued 
Sir Robert. 

" Unhappy, misguided creatures," assented 
Mr. Knightly, much in earnest. 

" And when will they grow quiet, Sir .?" 

" When, indeed. General .?" 



80 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

"What with White-boys and Right-boys, 
United-men, Shanavests, Caravats, Threshers, 
Carders, and now, Rockites, I believe, all I have 
heard or read of them since I left the country, 
shows that the old people of Ireland never can 
be peaceable so long as they remain what they 
are." 

" Plainly shows it. Sir Robert." 

" The mass of our half-countrymen are cer- 
tainly difficult to govern," said the Minister ; 
" I fear, they may be said to give His Majesty's 
Councils as much continued, though petty trou- 
ble, as any people who are, or have been, our 
declared enemies." 

" And I fear so, too, my Lord." 

"And 'tis a problem they should, Mr. Knight- 
ly ; — for whether we consider their long expe- 
rience of the Government and of the laws of 
England ; or their necessitous knowledge of 
their own level in the scale of nations ; or their 
constant opportunities to grow wiser, by obser- 
ving the course pursued by other people, and 
especially by their neighbours, towards happi- 
ness and prosperity ; in fact, in whatever way 
we balance the question, we are unable to forge 
it into any tangible solution capable of being 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 21 

comprehended according to the rules of cause 
and effect.'" 

Here may be detected instances of the rather 
infelicitous clash of imagery that occasionally 
marked his Lordship's language ; without depri- 
ving it, however, of the power of persuading or 
convincing, which it is well known to have pos- 
sessed, and in which few were his rivals. 

" One is sometimes thrown," said Mr. Knight- 
ly, " upon the unphilosophical supposition that 
would attribute to an ill-organized nature, their 
restlessness — to use no harder word, my Lord." 

" Their turbulence, their ferocit}'^, Sir," resum- 
ed Sir Robert Flood : *' their thirst of human 
life ; — and there. Sir, I have used your harder 
word, though you will not call it too hard, after 
all." 

" Not a bit too hard. Sir Robert." 

*' And in Heaven's name, Mr. Knightly, re- 
suming my former question, when are we to 
witness any abatement of excesses, which refuse 
peace, nay, even personal security, to such Eng- 
lish capitalists, or English gentlemen, or Irish 
gentlemen of English descent, as may think of 
settling in the country ?" 

" I suppose you to ask, General, if atrocities 



22 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

are becoming less frequent, and I answer, no. 
It was but a few nights before I began my 
journey to England, that, only three miles from 
my own house, an industrious Scotchman, who 
had recently taken a large farm, fell a victim, 
along with two of his servants, to the savage 
vengeance of Captain Rock's desperadoes." 
" And yet you hve in Ireland, Sir !" 
" Why, Sir Robert," smiling apologetically, 
" one must live where one can. Perhaps if I 
lived in your affluent and luxurious England, 
along with my half-dozen of raw- boned sons, 
and my seven or eight gadding daughters, I 
could not well manage my small means for liv- 
ing at all ; and so, as in the hope of advantage, 
the East-Indiaman braves the Cape, and the 
caravan the Desert, I must brave — no — not 
brave — that wouldn't do — ^but I must take my 
chance against Captain Rock." 

" It is, however, to be hoped," resumed the 
Minister, " that when the important measure 
of Union, as yet but nominally effected between 
the two countries, shall have fully come into 
operation, there will begin, in Ireland, a change 
of character, which must speedily repay us for 
the season of turmoil we now endure, and which 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 23 

will show itself as much the result of a well- 
squared dove-tailing with England, taking 
root during a necessary previous time, as the 
present sad state of things may be said to flow 
from a want of that close and kindly interweav- 
ing between the two people.** 

" If your Lordship means that Ireland will 
never be quiet, or prosperous, or worth living 
in, until English views, interests, industry — Eng- 
lish character, in fact — take place of the views, 
interests, and indolence, instead of industry — 
which confer its present character — then I agree 
with your Lordship," said the General. 

" In detail, Sir Robert, I meant that." 

" In a word, until the great majority of the 
population cease to be merely Irish, and be- 
come, like the only portion of it who are now 
respectable, intelhgent — ay, or civilized, — Eng- 
Hsh-Irish," continued Sir Robert. 

" Well, and my meaning allows of that con- 
struction too," assented the Minister. " Yes ; 
I like your word. Sir Robert ; it defines almost 
to a point what I might admit to have been 
my own previous opinion : yes, mi/ first cure 
for the evils of Ireland, certainly would be to 
make all her people English-Irish." 



24 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" And it would be my first cure too,"" ob- 
served Mr. Knightly, as if rather speaking to 
himself, than to those around him. 

" Begin then, my Lord, we pray you," said 
the young Viscount. 

" Or, my Lord," added Gerald, upon whom 
little of the conversation had been lost, " Wal- 
ter, here, or I, shall scarce live long enough to 
pay our Irish tenantry a visit ; don''t you think 
so, Walter ?" 

" Indeed I do." 

" But why, my good young friends .''" asked 
the Minister with a condescending smile. 

" Explain as well as you can, Gerald," said 
Lord Clangore. 

*' Thus then, my Lord ;" and in a little em- 
barassment the schoolboy addressed the Minis- 
ter — " until one can sleep soundly in one's bed 
in Ireland, one can hardly think of going there ; 
and Sir Robert, and Mr. Knightly, and even 
your Lordship, seem to say, that this must not 
be expected for a great many years." 

" Fairly argued, Gerald,"" laughed Sir Ro- 
bert. 

" My dear young Lord Clangore," resumed 
the Minister, assuming one of those full, manly 
expressions of face and manner which often

distinguished him ; " it is due to your ripening 
years, to remind you that, as has already been 
noticed, his Majesty's Government have made 
the beginning you so properly wish for. The 
legislative Union of Great Britain and Ireland 
may, indeed, be said to be the first link of that 
great chain which, in intellect, civilization, hap- 
piness, and glory, and at the same time, in 
habits, pursuits, and morals, is destined to inter- 
fuse into one national current, the people of 
England and Ireland." 

" I thank your Lordship for your explana- 
tion," said Lord Clangore, " and I fully accept 
it; and yet it is grievous to think that our 
young logician here is still right, when he sup- 
poses that many, many years must elapse before 
an Irish nobleman or gentleman, or, as I admit 
the propriety of the epithet, an English- Irish 
one, can reckon upon residing comfortably and 
happily amongst his mere Irish dependants." 

" Before that, many, many years must pass 
away, indeed," remarked Knightly. 

*' Meantime," resumed Lord Clangore, 
" while the purely Irish of the present day, 
in dificrent ranks of society, utter the lan- 
guage of disaffection to England, or fright- 
fully outrage her laws, what shall we call

26 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

their conduct with reference to the expected 
change ?" 

" Call it, if your Lordship pleases, the 
yeasty workings, which denote a decomposing 
process in the moral elements of the people, 
and which, pursuant to the theory, must leave 
behind a settled and purer state of society," an- 
swered — not the Minister, nor the General, but 
Mr. Knightly, out of his turn and place. 

" And are we merely to look on at the fer- 
mentation ?■" continued Lord Clangore, glancing 
round to his more important friends. 

" I suppose so," again put in Knightly ; " fid- 
dling" with his spoon. 

" But can you not also suppose. Sir, a mo- 
ment, during which we could not merely look 
on ?" 

*' I had rather not, my Lord :" Knightly 
smiled and bowed. 

" Tut, my good young Lord," said the Ge- 
neral, rising ; " you only contemplate circum- 
stances as likely as any that could occur to fa- 
cilitate the change we all think desirable. And 
so, indeed, says our distinguished countryman, 
now immortalizing himself on the Peninsula. 
One of the chief causes of Ireland's turbulence 
is her self-flattering conviction, that, as yet, she 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 27 

has been but half conquered. Whenever she 
deserves it, then, he argues, conquer her to her 
heart's content, and she will be quieter. And I 
think it a fair syllogism ; and, for my own part, 
can imagine no state of things better calculated 
to let us remodel the old Celtic character — to 
make it, in fact, English-Irish — that 's still my 
word — than one offered by the salutary humili- 
ation, perhaps diminution, of a newly-conquered 
people !" 

" Faith ! and it might be as good a way as 
any. General," assented Mr. Knightly. 

" I agree," said Lord Clangore. 

" And I," said Gerald. 

All now arose, and as a hint for furthering the 
real business of the morning, the Minister show- 
ed the way back to his library. 

It often happens that, when men meet about 
some specific matter of importance, the acci- 
dental conversation which precedes its discus- 
sion, proves tenfold the extent of that which 
arranges it. And such was the case in the 
present instance. Little could be suggested for 
the future advantage of their wards by the 
three guardians, or by one of the wards, Lord 
Clangore, in behalf of his brother, or his sister, 
or himself, which all did not seem to have 
c 2 



28 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

previously, though tacitly, agreed in. Lady 
Augusta could not yet be removed from De- 
vonshire, nor invited to resume her literary and 
other studies, notwithstanding a manifest im- 
provement in her health, reported by Lord 
Clangore, who, since their common calamity, 
had been to visit her. The young Viscount 
would return to Cambridge, complete his terms, 
and at one and twenty inherit his considerable 
estates in England and Ireland : then, if state 
ambition swayed his mind, no young nobleman 
could have better prospects. And, almost upon 
the same plan, Gerald was to go back to West- 
minster, afterwards to the University, and 
against the time when he must be called upon 
to consider it, make up his mind in the choice 
of a profession, — the portion of patrimony 
lying in Ireland, to which his father's will en- 
titled him, not seeming to dispense with his own 
exertions in the world. At present, he could 
not say what profession he might ultimately 
select. 

During the conversation on these points Mr. 
Knightly scarce spoke a word, except when he 
assented. As the meeting was about to dis- 
solve, however, he asked, 

'' When Lord Clangore shall have attained 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 29 

his twenty-first year, I presume we may reckon 
upon seeing him amongst us in Ireland ?" 

" That requires consideration," said the 
Minister. 

" The late Lord Clangore often objected to 
any son of his residing in Ireland," said Sir 
Robert, " or even temporarily mixing in the 
anomalous crowd called Irish Society, at least 
till an advanced period of life." 

" Then you will be one of the true English- 
Irish, my Lord ,?" pursued Mr. Knightly, 
good-humouredly. 

" I will, Sir," answered his noble ward. 

** And so will I," echoed Gerald. 

" Like all of us who — to speak modestly — 
do not put Ireland to the blush," resumed Sir 
Robert Flood. 

" We shall regret your absence, even while 
■we admire the motive for it, my Lord ;" and Mr. 
Knightly was bowing himself out of the room. 

" Do you leave town soon, Sir .?" asked Sir 
Robert. 

" To-day, General, for Devonshire, in the 
three-o'-clock coach, that starts from Lad-lane ; 
and thence, with little delay, home to Captain 
Rock ;" and continuing his bows, Mr. Knightly 
withdrew. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 



CHAPTER III. 

*' And, Gerald," said Lord Clangore, keep- 
ing up with his brother some confidential dis- 
course, upon the evening previous to their 
separation, the one for Cambridge, the other 
for Westminster — "make no friends and few 
acquaintances among the bo^^s fresh from our 
father's country you may meet at school ; 
guard yourself, at least, against the manners, 
temper, and even the brogue, for which -such 
of them as continue very national, and wish 
to be so, are remarkable." 

" Indeed, Walter, I know but one boy at 
Westminster x)f Irish connexion, that I 've 
any fancy to know ; Charles Flood, the Gene- 
ral's son : and he, I assure you, thinks so nearly 
with ourselves on this subject, that his ac- 
quaintance must be of use, rather than other- 
wise : he's very witty, and droll, and——"" 

** Have a care, Gerald, how you give him 
credit for that very kind of wit which you 



THE ANGLO IRISH. 31 

have yourself defined in so questionable a man- 
ner ; for, in fact, drollery is not wit, except, I 
suppose, in Ireland." 

" Charles is witty, though, Walter ; per- 
haps I need not have said droll : there 's no- 
thing broad about it ; nothing buffoonish or 
vulgar; but all so quiet and unawares, you 
would think, when you look at him lisping it 
out with his raised eye-brows and half-shut 
eyes ; and then, as I was going to say, though 
he makes us all laugh, whatever subject comes 
up, Charles is never so delightful as when he 
talks to us of the Irish people, men and 
women, and of the Irish places and things he 
was bred and born amongst." 

" ' Bred and born !' that 's as good an Irish- 
ism as I 've heard, Gerald." 

*' Well, may be so ; but one can easily for- 
get, you know." 

" And if you got it from young Flood — " 

" No, Walter, I bar that." 

" * Bar that !' over again !" 

" Well to be sure !" continued Gerald, in 
intended self-defence, while he really achieved 
a climax of Irish phraseology, garnishing it, 
too, with a very sweet bit of brogue. His 
brother raised up his hands and eyes in mock 



3% THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

horror, and when Gerald saw and acknow- 
ledged his stumble, both laughed heartily, 
and the subject changed. 

" I wish our poor Augusta had never fall- 
en into the care of her present protectress, 
Gerald." 

" So do I, for every reason ; and first, 
because she would not have been ill enough 
to require it." 

** And next, because of all ladies I have 
ever seen, Mrs. Knightly is the most Irish ; 
so peculiarly mannered, so strange and ante- 
diluvian, so talky, and, sometimes, so droll 
too, Gerald ; why, the very nationality of her 
tones will be injurious to our sister, if, indeed, 
they remain long enough together to allow of 
Augusta's unconscious imitation of them." 

" That will be bad, Walter ; particularly 
for a lady destined to move and excel in Eng- 
lish society.'" 

" Did you like Mrs. Knightly, during our 
short visit, Gerald ?" 

" I — I don't know ; I can't exactly say ; I 
never thought of the matter, then or since ; 
but I believe not. Can't Augusta have an- 
other companion in Devonshire ?" 

" The good Irish lady has, Irish as she is, 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 33 

been very attentive and kind to her, and 
evidently won Augusta's affections; so that 
separating them, at present, or, indeed, until 
our sister perfectly regains her health — " 

" Oh, it wouldn't do. But write to Au- 
gusta on the matter." 

" So I intend." 

"And when I go down to Devonshire, next 
vacation, I 'II report to you, Walter." 

The brothers parted. Gerald arrived at 
Westminster while the boys were out of doors, 
and hastened to join such of them as had been 
his companions. He soon found them, forming, 
along with some others, a little crowd, which 
hovered on the steps of a solitary lad, who, at 
a glance, Gerald saw was a new comer. 

" Oh, Blount !" lisped young Charles Flood, 
after temperately shaking his hand, and while he 
pointed to the sad-looking stranger, and affected 
a strong Irish accent ; " Oh, Blount, did you 
ever in your life see a pay-cock }"" 

" A what !" laughed Gerald, and the crowd 
loudly echoed his anticipating glee. The object 
of their ridicule was within hearing. 

" Why, a pay-cock, man : — wait till I tell 
you ;" and Flood, mimicking the face of a 
person astonished, and a little embarrassed in a 
c 5 



34 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

new situation, began to stare about him as he 
drawled out — ' James ! James ! ' — (that 's the 
curious serving man that came here with us) — 
' Oh, James, James ! ' — * Eh-a, Masther Harry ?' 
* James, look at the pay-cock !' 

This sally, obviously caricaturing a scene all 
had recently witnessed during the last interview 
between the new comer and his Irish servant, 
produced a fresh burst of laughter, which, how- 
ever, was interrupted in a startling way. Flood 
had scarce uttered his last mouthful of brogue, 
when a sharp and rather large stone, whizzing 
through his crowd of admirers, struck him on 
the head, and, as he lay stunned on the ground, 
the dangerous person who had hurled it, darted, 
with flashing eyes and features swollen, and 
stained with recent tears, upon his prostrate tor- 
mentor, as he shouted out — " No! but, James ! 
James I where are you to look at the puppy !" 

" Tear away the Pat !" cried several voices, 
as they saw him attempt farther to annoy young 
Flood. He was soon secured by Gerald and 
others. 

'* There's his Irish treachery!" they conti- 
nued ; " a blow even without a word I'' 

" He has been with Captain Rock among the 
boss !" cried others. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. S5 

" Report him ! report him ! and we shall soon 
be rid of him !" 

Flood now started to his feet and said — "No! 
let no one here speak of tale-bearing, or I am 
his enemy. We can settle the matter in another 
way." 

" Ay, serve him out for it ! serve him out !" 
was now the cry. Flood walked up to his 
assaulter. 

" Williams, if that is your name ? — " 

" It is my name," angrily interrupted the 
captive. 

" Very well. Let him go, Blount ; my merry- 
men, let him go ; we shall have a quiet word 
together:" he was released. *' Wilhams, then, 
most princely and most Milesian Williams — 
though 'tis not a Milesian name, after all — smells 
of the leek, I think — but 'twill do as well — 
Taffy is as hot as Paddy any day — and when 
mixed, as in thy puissant person — " 

"Balderdash!" exclaimed Williams, "say it 
at once, if you're not afraid of the very sound 
of it." 

" Nay, gentle Pat— ap— Taffy— ap — Wil- 
Hams, courage and good humour may go to- 
gether." 

" You want to fight it out with me ?" 



36 THB ANGLO-IRISH. 

" Thou hast expressed it : lads, get him a 
friend and a bottle-holder among you ; Blount 
and Morton, you are for me ; come along.'^ 

" I want no friend here,''^ growled Williams ; 
" I can do it alone." 

"Friend, or no friend, there shall be fair 
play," said several ; and while the greater por- 
tion of the crowd hurried oflF to prepare a ring on 
the destined spot, a few ran to provide brandy, 
as an approved stimulant for the mettle of the 
combatants. But, by some unknown means, 
one of the authorities received notice of the in- 
tended battle, though not of the aggression that 
had led to it, and soon appearing on the ground, 
commanded peace, in the name of heavy pe- 
nalties and punishment. As the disappointed 
throng dispersed. Flood whispered in Williams's 
ear, ** To-morrow evening, then, and here." 

" Any evening, and any where," he was an- 
swered ; and, taking Gerald's arm. Flood turned 
away, as also did every other boy from the tur- 
bulent stranger, leaving him quite alone— cut, 
in fact. 

" Now there 's a drop of the true Hibernian 
blood for you, Gerald," said Flood, as they 
walked on. 

*' Shocking!" replied Gerald: " he shows no 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 37 

notion of resentment in a fair way, or even a 
manly way.'^ 

*' And yet he 's not one of the prime ones ei- 
ther; being no Roman-Catholic, in the first place, 
and having nothing to do with the good old 
stock in the second ; but, of course, he learned it 
amongst them." 

" He must forget what he has learned then, 
if he means to live here. Flood." 

" Let 's see how he '11 take the initiation 
to-night," answered Flood ; " that tries temper 
and sense." 

" Yes ; and he '11 have time to cool,'' agreed 
Gerald. 

The night came, and about the hour when 
the clock was striking twelve, Williams, awak- 
ing out of a sound sleep, in consequence of 
some sudden rough treatment, found himself 
lying on the floor, surrounded by a hideous 
row of figures in white drapery and with devi- 
lish faces, visible only by the phosphoric light 
smeared over them. A subdued howl, at the 
same time, assaulted his ears ; and, after a 
second's recollection, he thought he felt as 
if he had been soused in water. The na- 
tural terror that his first glance around him 
had brought to his heart, was corrected by this 



S8 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

latter observation. It seemed now clear that, 
instead of being haunted by evil spirits, he was 
suffering much ill-treatment at the hands of his 
school-fellows ; and never having heard of such 
proceedings, and construing into a particular 
personal outrage pranks that many a boy had 
experienced before him, the moody young Irish- 
man gave way to a paroxysm of fury, which 
spent itself in the wildest efforts at retaliation. 
But those efforts proved as vain as they were 
wild. In a few moments he found himself in 
utter darkness, far from his bed, in what direc- 
tion he could not tell, and receiving, at the 
hands of his unseen persecutors, a succession of 
ill-usage, their knowledge of the localities of 
the apartment enabling them to keep out of his 
reach, while the well-known sounds of — '* James, 
look at the pay-cock !" proved, if any proof were 
wanting, to whom he stood indebted ; until at 
last, after hours of misery, chilled, and drenched, 
he sunk on the boards, and became at once tamed 
and comforted in the deep sleep of exhaustion. 

*' He will make a story of it in the morn- 
ing," whispered Flood to Gerald, as they part- 
ed for the night ; — " his nature is enough for 
any thing." 

But in this instance only they wronged the 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 39 

Hibernian. He took no steps to obtain satis- 
faction at the hands of the constituted authori- 
ties ; he even did not allude to the scene of 
the previous night in their presence. A con- 
firmed gloom of brow, and a sullen silence, alone 
showed the sense of wrong that brooded within. 
Through the whole day he sat or strayed about 
alone. The evening, and with it the hour for 
renewed battle, drew on, and he was the first 
on the ground. Against his repeated protest, 
friends were allotted to him, and he and Flood 
" set-to." Williams was the stronger and elder 
boy, and when his hits told, as at the com- 
mencement was the case, his adversary suffer- 
ed from them. But Flood had the advan- 
tage in *' the science" — " the real thing;'' be- 
sides being much cooler, and more on his 
guard ; and after a few rounds, gradually ha- 
rassed his man, until feebleness and insensibility 
began to appear. Williams then partook, for 
the first time, of the proffered stimulant, that 
Flood had not from the outset refused ; rallied, 
and did some wild work ; but after a contest of 
an hour, finally lay powerless. Many boys, 
interested by his spirit and bravery, took care 
of him ; and even his first offence seemed almost 
forgotten. 



40 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" Will the Milesian be more rational now ?"" 
inquired the victor of his friend Gerald, as 
they returned from the ground. 

" We can watch him to-morrow," replied Ge- 
rald ; " and, Flood, if he promises fair, no need 
to cut the poor devil altogether, you know." 

" Certainly not on this account; but let us see." 

Flood had already shaken Williams's hand, 
but as he could scarce have been sensible of the 
overture, fresh advances towards good-fellow- 
ship were made the ensuing morning. But the 
beaten boy scowlingly drew back from his con- 
queror, muttering that it was not over yet ; and 
still he sat or sauntered moodily alone. In the 
course of the day he was observed to speak 
apart with a Jew-hawker, who came within 
view ; and, seemingly at his instance, the iti- 
nerant merchant retired, after a few hours re- 
appeared, and Williams purchased something of 
him. Gerald met him walking rapidly towards 
the more frequented part of the play-ground, 
his hands thrust into his pockets, and a mixed 
satisfaction and fierceness in his look. 

** Where 's Flood .'*" he asked, as they passed. 

Gerald answered. — "Follow me, then; you ""re 
his friend, and he may want you ; follow me." 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 41 

Gerald did follow in his hasty steps, and they 
soon came up with Flood. 

** There, fellow !" cried the Irishman, fling- 
ing down one pistol, as he took out another ; 
" meet me like a gentleman at last, since I can't 
wait to learn your * stable-boy' knack of fight- 
ing — put him on his ground !" 

An assistant of the school seasonably inter- 
fered, the whole transaction was reported to 
the master, and next day Williams was ordered 
home to Ireland. 

" They never forgive," observed Flood to 
Gerald ; " they will never let you be friends 
with them." 

*' I have often been told that," replied Gerald, 
" and now I see it." 

" They must have fighting, Blount; 'tis meat, 
drink, and clothes to them — (indeed, sometimes 
they want it as a substitute for these matters) — 
if they can have it with an enemy, and with an 
Englishman above the world, all the better; but 
rather than go without it, they must have it 
from each other." 

The young friends, along with other boys of 
their age, rowed up the river the same evening, 
beyond Chelsea. By the way, the manful com- 



42 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

mand which Westminster boys of twelve or 
thirteen, exhibit over a four-oared, sometimes a 
six-oared boat, is quite delightful to witness. 
An equal number of professional watermen 
could not much surpass them; as, sitting strip- 
ped to their work, they pull with their little 
muscular arms, and bend their little bodies in 
masterly unison. 

" Hark !" cried Flood, as they passed 
Cheyne-walk, " I hear the sweet silvery sounds 
of home ;" a loud clatter from a group of 
Irish labourers just then broke on the ears of 
all. The men stood debating round the door 
of a public-house, seemingly half tipsy, and 
as if cordially, though so boisterously, ex- 
horting each other to step in again and become 
wholly so. The juvenile boatmen rested on 
their oars to observe them. 

" They are going to fight," said Gerald, who 
did not understand Irish vivacity : " they are 
going to fight. Flood, amongst each other, 
just as you said it, a few hours ago." 

" No, no," replied Flood, *' that 's to come : 
this is only the love-making that brings it on. 
Pull, lads, we shall be time enough on our re- 
turn from Battersea or the Red-house." 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 43 

So well had he prophesied, that, just as the 
boat shot by the same spot, after about half an 
hour's absence, a discordant yelling and voci- 
feration issued from the public-house, and, in a 
few minutes, out rushed the dearest friends in 
the world, breaking each other's heads, some 
with the very utensils in which they had been 
pledging mutual love, and peace, and happi- 
ness ; some with portions of chairs, wrenched 
asunder for the occasion, and some with pokers. 
No brow amongst them was unstained with 
blood ; few were able to stand upright for more 
than a second at a time, ere they were felled to 
the earth ; and many lay motionless, perhaps 
dead, upon it. But I will not detail the scene. 
The only relief it shall receive at my hands is, 
by contrasting such a display of strange and fo- 
reign uproar, with the systematised quiet and 
indifference, not to say contempt, with which 
it was regarded by all classes of the people 
amongst whom it occurred, and who, evidently 
against their taste, were lookers on. 

" There 'tis for you now, Gerald," remarked 
Flood. 

*' Fickle, turbulent creatures ! " exclaimed 
Gerald. " No, I see it, plainly, they never can 



»** THE ANGLO-IRISH. 



be quiet ; you never can be at peace with them :" 
and in strengthened conviction, he recollected 
the theory of a total change of nationality, ori- 
ginated by his friend's father, and asserted to 
be an indispensable step towards the peace and 
happiness of his paternal country. 

Upon another evening, when he, Flood, and 
the rest of their little boat's^crew, had proceeded 
down the river as far as Bermondsey, and when, 
in search of some refreshments, they landed and 
explored that dirty and straggling ramification 
of the overgrown Babylon, a general riot and 
panic possessed its narrow warehouse, or shed- 
house lanes, the Irish population, which there 
preponderates, having just turned out in civil 
warfare. — The yells and imprecations of the 
half-mad people rang far and wide ; with gashed 
heads and shattered limbs the discomfited par- 
ties lay on the pavement ; constables interposed, 
and in a twinkling were routed and sorely mal- 
treated ; until at length, whenever a peace-mak- 
ing Englishman presented himself, or even a 
merely peaceable one, who had in no way in- 
terfered, the staves of the enfuriated rioters 
were dealt round in indiscriminate, and, it 
might seem, merely impulsive fury. The place 
appeared like a town just stormed and taken 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 45 

possession of by a band of pirates, before whose 
animal desperation the quiet inhabitants shrunk 
in dismay, or were flying in terror. But Gerald 
did not require this new fact to strengthen his. 
former conclusions. He was only more disgusted. 
Vacation came on, and, previous to his jour- 
ney to Devonshire, Gerald spent a few days 
with his friends in town ; one he devoted, still 
in the company of Flood and a few other 
boys, to an exploring ramble from the West 
End towards the city. Wallcing into Hol- 
born, the now familiar noise of Irish uproar 
once more reached them down one of the nar- 
row alleys that communicate with the very ca- 
pital of Irish London colonies — dear St. Giles's 
itself. Gerald would have declined farther no- 
tice of the disagreeable occurrence, but, yield- 
ing to the wishes of his young friends, he at 
length advanced, with them, to the outskirts of 
the fray. It is enough to observe, that it ge- 
nerally resembled those he had before witness- 
ed, with the addition of female combatants, 
scattered through the male ranks, or screaming 
and imprecating, four or five at a time, out of 
all the windows within view. Cautiously pass- 
ing the unruly mob, the young party turned 
down another street of the same colony, in 



46 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

which reigned comparative peace, but which 
presented other fruitful subjects for contem- 
plation. Here, in the very core of English 
cleanliness, order, and comfort, was a picture of 
all Gerald had ever heard about Irish nastiness 
and misery, as vivid as if he stood on Irish 
ground, or as if the wretched beings, by whose 
agency it was displayed, had never had an op- 
portunity of seeing or knowing better ; though 
they need but turn round their eyes, or at far- 
thest walk a few steps, to supply themselves with 
contrasts that ought to bring into their cheeks 
the blush of shame, and into their hearts the 
zeal of amendment. The door of almost every 
dingy house stood open, and women, and girls, 
untidily dressed, with unwashed faces, sat or 
grouped round the thresholds, gabbling loud, 
and doing nothing. Squalid and ragged chil- 
dren sprawled about the streets, which were 
puddly, though it was summer, and while every 
street that led into the vile district, was clean ; 
and cabbage-leaves, and cabbage- stalks, and a 
variety of other rubbish, offended the eye of 
even the least orderly observer. 

" See,'^ said Flood, " it is not the heroic 
tastes of our dear countrymen I so much mar- 
vel at, but they cannot even be taught to — " 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 47 

" They will never be taught any thing they 
should know as long as they are Irisli," inter- 
rupted Gerald. 

One of Gerald's companions was a young Eng- 
lish gentleman of that well-regulated turn of 
mind, dignity of manner, and openness of heart, 
which mark the best specimens of English charac- 
ter. Upon their boating psu-ties to Chelsea and 
Bermondsey he had witnessed scenes, already no- 
ticed, and while it was evident that his notions of 
propriety received, on these occasions, a disagree- 
ble shock, yet, with an amiable and delicate tact, 
he strove to conceal from Gerald any strong ex- 
pression of feeling that might tend to humiliate 
him. Now, however, as they all turned out of 
St, Giles's, he could not avoid saying — " Blount, 
I am sorry these people are your countrymen." 
'* Then your sorrow is unnecessary," replied 
Gerald, " for mi/ countrymen these people are 
not. You might, indeed, during his lifetime, 
have fixed them upon my father, though in 
spite of him ; but I was not even born amongst 
them : at all events, if I am to be called Irish, 
let it be with a word prefixed — English-Irish." 
" That is — ^" said his friend. 
" That is,"" continued Gerald, energetically, 
" even if Irish by birth — " 



48 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" Or rather, by having been born in the 
country," put in Flood. 

*' Yes, Flood ; for, after all, people of Eng- 
lish blood, in the first instance, do not grow 
Irish, by being born in Ireland : but I mean, 
that, supposing such to be my case, I wish to be- 
come English, purely English, in all my habits 
and notions; and more, as your father says. 
Flood, I believe Ireland never can be in any 
respect what it ought to be, until all the people 
in it, or the greater number of them, at least, 
are made as English, as I hope, I am." 

" My excellent father is, no doubt, excellent 
authority," said Flood ; '' but his commander- 
in-chief must, according to the articles of war, 
be allowed to be better ; and it is well known, 
Blount, that the Great Captain, of course seeing 
things as you and I, and all of us do, rejects the 
name of Irishman, and desires to be considered 
a — (I believe his term is) — British subject." 

** Your father''s term would be better. Flood." 

" I wish this had been sooner understood by 
our countrymen, at least by any of them who 
ever escaped out of Ireland, good Gerald," said 
Flood to Gerald, a few days after, as, under the 
magnificent roof of Westminster Abbey, they 
resumed the question. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 49 

" And it was," answered Gerald ; " look 
here," leading him up to Goldsmith's monu- 
ment, ** here is a proof. It is well known that 
Goldsmith drew from his Irish recollections 
when he wrote the ' Deserted Village ;' what 
but a disinclination to link himself with Ire- 
land, could have hindered him from placing 
the village where he really found it ?" 

" It might have been too dirty a village, 
where he found it," said Flood ; "a little St- 
Giles's." 

" Well," resumed Gerald, smiling ; " even 
so you prove that in Goldsmith's judgment 
it was first necessary to make it English-Irish. 
But this is not the only way in which he has 
shown a prudent shyness of the country that 
happened to give him birth. He satirized it 
at every opportunity." 

" I remember," said Flood, 

" ' There's my countrvmaiij HigginSj och ! let him alone. 
For making a blunder, or picking a bone !' " 

" And the epistle you quote from," resumed 
Gerald, " was written to Lord Clare ; and as 
Goldsmith must have known, from his Lord- 
ship's previous sentiments, that he would enjoy 
a keen, though deserved taunt on mere Irish

peculiarities, we may conclude that he, too, 
was English-Irish." Had the reading, or the 
memory of the young theorist served him, he 
might have named more important instances of 
his assertion, as well before as at the time now 
chosen. Among others, the great Duke of Or- 
monde would have shown that, whether in his 
national policy, or in taking care of his personal 
interests, (and he excelled in the one as well as 
in the other,) to make Ireland English, and him- 
self, English-Irish, was, long before the era of 
Goldsmith or Lord Clare, the guiding wish of 
the most ancient nobleman of the English, or 
rather of the Anglo Norman Pale in the sister 
country. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 51 



CHAPTER IV. 

Gerald proceeded to visit Lady Augusta 
in Devonshire, travelling in a spruce-built 
buggy, driven by a servant. His sister occu- 
pied a pretty cottage, in one of the most beau- 
tiful situations outside a sea-coast village. At 
some distance the road commanded a view of 
the cottage ; and as it was a steep road, and he 
could not be very speedily driven down, he 
jumped out of the vehicle and ran before it, 
hoping to meet Lady Augusta on his way, or 
at least to see her on some one of the paths 
about the little residence. 

At a turn of the road, where on one side 
the fence was high and overshadowed by an 
elegant group of slight ash trees, the sound pf 
young female voices, in laughter and joyous 
hilarity, caught Gerald's ear. Climbing gently 
up the fence, and peeping through a cluster of 
bushes, he saw, seated in a garden-chair, em- 
D 2 



52 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

ployed at her needle, his sister's protectress 
and nurse, Mrs. Knightly ; before her, on the 
grass, and sitting face to face, were his sister 
herself, looking much better than he had ex- 
pected to meet her, and a little girl, some years 
her junior, with glowing blue eyes, flaxen hair, 
shaken wildly about her face, beautiful straight 
nose and cherry mouth, and cheeks so bril- 
liant with the colour of health and loveliness, 
that they might remind one of sun-light 
breaking in transparent suffusion through a 
garden screen of roses. A book, turned down 
on the grass, a guitar, and a little work-basket, 
lay near them ; but they seemed to have given 
study and work of every kind to the winds, if 
any could have blown strong enough for the 
purpose, on that delicious summer day ; and 
laughter, nay, shouts of laughter rang merrily 
through their rural retreat as the strange girl 
archly contested some point with her scarcely 
less vivacious companion. 

As Gerald peeped at this scene, his first feel- 
ing was sympathy with its unrestrained enjoy- 
ment, particularly on account of his sister, 
whose health and spirits seemed at last equal to 
so happy an assertion of existence. The sub- 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 53 

dued, motherly smile of Mrs. Knightly always 
kept up, but increased every now and then by 
a glance at the two delighted girls, or by some 
ecstatic climax of their laughter, also pleased 
and interested him ; yet soon after he began 
to ask himself if such a display was charac- 
terised by the elegant decorum to which Lady 
Augusta ought to be habituated, and, indeed, 
(previous to her retreat to Devonshire,) of the 
constant impression of which upon her habits 
and manner she had given such full evidence. 
Then he was struck by what he felt to be the 
boisterous mirth of her little playmate; by a 
peculiar air about the child that, beautiful as 
she was, seemed, when put in comparison with 
the high-born children of her age, to whose so- 
ciety he had been accustomed, neither fashion- 
able nor proper ; and at length, some words 
and phrases addressed by her to Lady Augusta 
becoming distinctly audible through the laugh- 
ter of both, Gerald began to doubt if her rank 
and quality entitled her to be made, by Mrs. 
Knightly, the familiar companion of his sister. 

" Sing it, I tell you !"" — cried the blooming 
little stranger, holding up to Lady Augusta, in 
mock threat, two or three long stalks of grass 



S4t THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

she had just plucked at her side : and the tone 
in which she spoke, though musical, had a 
strange sound. 

" I can't, Rhoda!" replied her companion, 
clasping her hands playfully in appeal. 

" Sai/ it, then !" 

" Nay, that 's the difficulty, Rhoda ! I've no 
great demur to your air — 'tis pretty enough— 
but your words — oh, your words !" — in affected 
horror, and ending in another triumphant laugh. 

*' Sing it, or say it, or /'// kill you dead !** 
continued Rhoda, shaking aloft the formida- 
ble scourge in one hand, and twining the 
other through Lady Augusta's beautiful brown 
tresses. 

" The pure brogue," thought Gerald. 

" Come !" Rhoda went on, gently apply- 
ing the grass stalks to her playmate's neck, 
while both now clung to each other, and con- 
tinued their loud laugh — " Come, you proud 
English lady ! — say my words — my beautiful 
Irisli words — or — /'// be the death o' you ! what! 
they ugly ! they not musical !" 

" The little pigs say words hke them !" 
shouted Lady Augusta, struggling with her 
dictator. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 55 

" Take that, then ! and that, and that !" and 
Rhoda again used her scourge ; " that for your 
disobedience — and that for your bad speech !*" 

" Well, Rhoda — I will, I will learn them 
of you !" 

" Listen, then !" and Rhoda warbled to an 
air that Lady Augusta had called pretty, 
"her beautiful Irish words," during the pro- 
nunciation of which, although assisted by 
melody, the harsh sounds of several acghs, 
ocghs, and ucghs, sadly offended Gerald's ear. 

" Why don't you go on ?" resumed Rhoda, 
as Lady Augusta interrupted her with mock- 
ing laughter. 

" No — not for the world !" answered her 
pupil, putting out her hands in abhorrence. 

" You won't, won't you ?"" and again Rhoda 
offered to inflict chastisement ; again was re- 
sisted ; again ensued a struggle ; until clasped 
in each other's arms, they finally rolled down 
on the velvet grass. 

Gerald now felt displeased : it was evident, 
he concluded, that in the person of this little 
wild girl, Mrs. Knightly had introduced to the 
intimate acquaintance of his solitary sister, the 
child of some Irish peasant-servant, brought 



56 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

over by the good lady from the hills and 
bogs of her native country. With some cold- 
ness and reserve of manner he presented himself 
to Mrs. Knightly from his peeping-place, and 
passing her, after a low bow, gravely advanced 
to Lady Augusta. As his eye still dwelt on 
Rhoda, her dress corrected his first conclu- 
sion ; it might, however, have been bestowed 
on her; but when, as much in consequence 
of Mrs. Knightly's gentle exclamation of sur- 
prise and welcoming, as of his own approach, 
Lady Augusta started up to embrace her 
brother, the sudden change from hilarity to 
gravity and self-possession, and from that 
again to a provoking mixture of loftiness 
and naivete, of propriety and archness, which 
marked Rhoda's manner, more fully con- 
vinced him she was no clown's child, born or 
educated. 

" Gerald, Gerald !" said Augusta, after their 
embrace : " come here and know and fall in 
love with ray friend and companion, during 
many months — my wild Irish princess, who 
sings me wild Irish songs made to her beau- 
teous wild Irish ancestresses, ever so long ago, 
by bards with white beards, on their wire harps 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 57 

and things our good, kind, delightful little 

cousin, Rhoda Knightly." 

" Miss Knightly ]" stammered Gerald, bow- 
ing. 

" My daughter, Sir, Miss Knightly ;" and 
the mother, quietly evincing the impression, 
such as it was, which she had received from 
Gerald's reserve at his first appearance, rose, 
and held her daughter by the hand, at her 
side. 

" All the worse," thought Gerald—" the 
kind of assumed equality here will only as- 
sist the impression of disagreeable peculiari- 
ties, on my sister." 

But while in the very act of thinking those 
words, Rhoda returned his repeated bow in a 
way so distant, and, using Gerald's own men- 
tal definition, proper, as must have satisfied, so 
far as it v/ent, the most scrupulous brother. 
And, indeed, it went far to satisfy him, as 
might be seen by the expression of his face, 
changing from the blank of disapprobation to 
the glow of interest. Mrs. Knightly saw the 
change, and was quickly responsive to it ; her 
good-humour became fully restored, and in 
d5 



58 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

features, voice, and words, in all she said or did, 
there was visible a wish to make her young 
people happy. " The good lady is kind," so- 
liloquised Gerald, " and, perhaps, of a respect- 
able class in her own country ; but much is 
wanted for England. The daughter, too, 
seems not quite so strong a character as I had 
at first supposed : yet, see there — " 

Rhoda, escaped from the demureness half 
produced by, and half-affected at, the sudden 
appearance of a stranger, was relapsing into a 
vivacity Gerald thought un-English. Holding 
a grave side-face to him so long as she pre- 
tended to think he was regarding her, she 
voted his eyes off whenever she pleased, and 
then, with strange contortions of her beautiful 
features, continued playfully to threaten Au- 
gusta for her recent obstinacy, and do all in 
her power to keep up the loud mirth of that 
young lady. Again, however, something dig- 
nified or graceful appeared about her, which, 
recommended by her beauty, the young critic 
admired ; and yet again, its effect was marred 
by a return of something so arch, he nearly 
called it bold ; and thus did Gerald's notions 
of his new acquaintance fluctuate for some time. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 59 

A servant— a real Irish peasant girl — ap» 
proached from the cottage, with cream and 
strawberries. The broad though rosy face, 
wide- winged nose, and wide mouth, which, 
when she smiled, allowed the upper gum to be 
seen, reminded Gerald of visages he had be- 
held in St. Giles's; and indeed, laid claim to 
almost unadulterated Celtic descent. Her shy- 
ness too, her gait, and the crude fashion in 
which her gown had been cut, (obviously she 
had brought it from home with her,) struck 
him as characteristic of sad inferiority in the 
scale of her parallel class in England, as de- 
cisive, indeed, as v/as the difference between 
Mrs. Knightly and her daughter, and other old 
and young ladies of his acquaintance. 

" Get more cream, Biddy ; Lady Augusta 
likes it," said Mrs. Knightly, as the girl de- 
posited her dishes and plates on the grass. 

*' God bless her darling young ladyship, I 
sholl, mam," answered Biddy, with a drop- 
curtsey, so sudden and deep as to be rather 
startling ; and though the zealous smile that 
lighted in her large good eyes, and the phrase 
of respectful affection towards his sister, with 
which it was accompanied, were not quite lost 



60 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

upon Gerald, still the broad, sing-song brogue, 
the vile " shoU, mam," the very name, " Bid- 
dy,** and even the wordy acquiescence, when 
silence and obedience alone should have been 
her proper part, effectually disposed of the girl 
in his estimation. He became confirmed in 
all his former dislikes to pure Irish people, 
and the reflection that Augusta was surround- 
ed by indifferent specimens of native manner, 
pressed upon him. 

He turned an eye, prepared for renewed cri- 
ticism, on Rhoda ; but just at that moment, his 
heart found cause to oppose his calm opinions. 
The sunny-faced child was in the act of spread- 
ing over Augusta's knees, as she again sat on 
the grass, a little white handkerchief ; and then 
she bounded up, telling her " for her life" not 
to " stir a single bit," returned with the fruit 
and cream, adjusted it nicely on the handker- 
chief, put the dessert-spoon into her companion's 
hand, and commanding her not to " leave a 
single one," and holding up her lips for a kiss 
of promise, snatched her own little portion,— 
Mrs. Knightly and Gerald having been help- 
ed — and then confronted, as if to watch her, 
the object of her fond care and interest. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 61 

" How very, very well you are getting, dear 
Augusta," said Gerald, as, gazing on his sister, 
he enjoyed the look of her round cheeks, co- 
vered with natural though delicate blushes, and 
dimpling in smiles that proclaimed freedom from 
pain or lassitude, and the reign of high spirits 
and heart's ease. 

" Yes," laughed Rhoda, " the lady looks 
quite impudent with her good health, to-day." 

Gerald did not like the style of the comment. 

" Then, Gerald, thank our dear Mrs. Knight- 
ly, and our dear, dear wild Irish Rhoda," re- 
plied Augusta. 

" Thank the good Giver of health and of 
every blessing, my love," said Mrs. Knightly. 

** Ay, thank the good God, indeed," agreed 
Rhoda, in serious earnestness that once more 
pleased Gerald — " but," she added, changing 
both her manner and her style of speaking, so as 
to efface the favourable hit — " if you dare thank 
me, Augusta — I'll settle you for it, when I catch 
you by yourself." 

" The girl should have said Lady Augusta," 
thought Gerald. 

But Augusta showed by her laugh that she 
had not missed the formality. " And now. 



62 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

Rhoda," she resumed, " sing those two curious 
lines you sing us every day when we have had 
this fruit ; 'tis such an Irish simile ! so poeti- 
cally Irish ! 

And without hesitation Rhoda hummed, in 
an affected drawling way, adding to her own 
little brogue, and carefully pronouncing, as the 
reader shall see it spelled, the last word of the 
couplet ; 

" Her cheeks are like roses, her mouth much the same. 
Like a dish of fresh strawberries, smothered in 

CRAME." 

"Vile," thought Gerald: and — "yes," he 
said aloud, with emphasis, and without a smile, 
though his was the only grave face — " yes, 
Augusta, in sentiment, words, and style, 'tis in- 
deed very Irish." 

" Oh, very ! very !" cried Rhoda, perhaps 
not insensible to the point of the remark, al- 
though, for that very reason she hummed the 
lines over again. " Come, now !" she went on, 
jumping up; " we want our asses! 'tis time for 
our asses ! where are they ?" 

" Lady Augusta says donkeys," observed Mrs. 
Knightly. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 68 

" Well, I know, mamma ; but isn't it all the 
same in Ireland ? ay, and in proud England, 
too ? Isn't an ass an ass any where ?" as she 
glided by Gerald. He thought she glanced at 
him ; he reddened and hated her ; but he might 
have mistaken ; and the doubt left him his self- 
command. 

'• Isn't it time for our ride, mamma — isn't it, 
isn't it ?" importuned Rhoda, running to her 
mother, and clinging round her. Mrs. Knightly, 
kissing her forehead, assented. Gerald felt no 
interest in the Irish mother kissing her forward 
Irish child. Rhoda continued, " Then you 
give the word, do you, do you ? For you know 
you must give it, mamma, or Augusta won't 
come for my leave, though I often tell her not 
to mind you — " she added, playfully glancing 
at Mrs. Knightly from under her long eye- 
lashes, and running away. 

" Dan ! Dan ! where is Dan to ride with 
us ?" still cried Rhoda. 

** Perhaps Mr. Blount will ride with his sis- 
ter to-day, Rhoda," said Mrs. Knightly. 

" Oh, very well, — don't stir, Augusta — don't 
stir a step !" stamping, and clenching her little 
hand ; " I'll run to the house, and tell Biddy to 



64 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

tell Dan to come with three asses — donkeys — 
instead of ttvo, to the gate at the road-side, a 
little way yonder." 

" And Mr. Blount may prefer to ride out 
with Lady Augusta, alone," resumed Mrs. 
Knightly, as her lively girl flew off. 

" Oh, very well," again said Rhoda, not 
stopping. 

" No, Rhoda, no !" cried Augusta, while 
Gerald remained silent — " order the three don- 
keys round to the gate ; I'll not ride at all with- 
out you ; Gerald won't ride without you." 

" Very well, very well !" and she disappeared, 
and in a few minutes returned, out of breath, 
her own hat and little habit put on, while she 
carried Augusta's upon her arm. With every 
contrivance that could save the invalid the least 
effort, Rhoda then insisted on " doing her up." 

" 'Tis ostentatious, troublesome attention, after 
all," thought Gerald ; thus allowing Rhoda to 
slip from the only hold she had before taken 
upon his interest, Dan quickly came to the 
gate near at hand with the donkeys, and the 
young equestrians trotted forward on the road 
towards the high grounds, at some distance. 

" How well you have learned to ride here, 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 65 

Augusta," said Gerald, as, led by Rhoda, they 
pushed on as fast as the moderate-paced animals 
could or would allow them. Though a good 
horseman, Gerald's total want of acquaintance, 
previously, with the humours of a donkey's 
paces, made him feel sensible of some inferio- 
rity. 

" Yes," replied Augusta, " Rhoda taught 
me — but I am yet much inferior to my mistress: 
see, we must switch our steeds to keep up with 
her : how boldly she rides l"^ 

"Very boldly," answered Gerald, as, at the 
increased motion, slight as it was, of his donkey, 
he wavered somewhat in his stirrups. 

" Which way do we take .'*'" he enquired, as 
now all kept on abreast. 

" Up against that hill — and then that — and 
then down that and that," replied Rhoda, point- 
ing onward, " and 'twill be so pleasant ! Come, 
Neddy — " shaking her switch — " oh, why are 
you an ass, Neddy, and not a lady's hunter.?"" 

" Up and down such hills as those ! " cried 
Gerald, startled at the whole speech, for his 
sister's sake, as well as for its own sake — and 
his own sake, too — " Augusta, are you per- 
mitted to take such rides .?" 



0& THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" Oh, yes — ever since a week or so after 
Rhoda came from Ireland." 

" Permitted !" echoed Rhoda ; " why, Master 
Blount, who 's to hinder us ? or what ? we Ve 
not afraid, are we ?" 

"No, Miss Knightly, I am sure i/ou're not 
afraid," said Gerald. 

" And are you ?'''* 

" Not by your side, certainly." 

** But you're not by my side, certainly, nor 
at Augusta's either — why you keep behind, Sir, 
when you ought to attend at our bridles, from 
one to another, and go on before us to see if the 
road is clear, and be ready to lead us over a 
stream, in a hollow, or over a heap, or things of 
that kind" — (Rhoda was thinking of by-roads 
in Ireland) — " goodness gracious ! — if Robert 
CRourke was now on your little beast's back ! 
—he's a littler boy than you. Master Blount, 
and younger by a year or two, but he'd think 
less of the tallest hunter his father has, than 
you think of that creeping go-by-the-ground — " 

" And where is this mighty Robert ?" asked 
Augusta. 

" Och ! in Ireland to be sure — dear, dear 
Ireland !" 

" I wish you were with him there," thought 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 67 

Gerald, as, at a hasty application of its rider's 
switch, his donkey swerved aside, and again 
discomposed him. 

*' Come on, Sir," continued Rhoda, putting 
her animal to the best of his sluggish mettle. 

" This wretch will not allow me — an Irish 
donlcey, I warrant," he continued, in a mutter. 

" No, Sir; but mightn't an English ass be in 
fault .'"' and Rhoda, laughing spitefully, and 
now leaving no room to doubt of her intentional 
satire, left Gerald to follow as he best could. 
" Ay," he soliloquised, when at length he had 
mastered his donkey ; " Augusta shall have 
other associates now that she gets better; the 
old lady's kindness and successful nursing must 
not, of course, be forgotten ; Walter and I, and 
Augusta, too, must, in every possible way, and 
in every prudent way, recompense her, but not 
in THIS way ; not by leaving a young lady to 
be inconvenienced by the manners of her and 
her daughter, more than she has been served 
by their attentions." 

The heights, after all, were explored, up and 
down. Rhoda still boldly led on, till at last the 
young trio turned towards home by a different 
road. 



08 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" I do like this place, for 'tis like Ireland ;" 
said Rhoda, looking around on their broken 
path. 

" Then I like it too," assented Augusta, 
" because you like it, and because it is like 
what you likci." 

*' I can like it, only because 'tis England," 
demurred Gerald ; it was clear they would not 
agree. 

" And I could almost hate it, if I had no 
other reason to like it," retorted Rhoda; *' Eng- 
land must be Irish, or look Irish at least, — the 
hills, and the fields, and the places ; the cows, 
the sheep, and the birds ; and the men, the 
women, and the children ; and smile and laugh. 
Irish, and talk to me, and do to me Irish, before 
I once love or like a sod or creature of it." 

" And I fear," rejoined Gerald, now laugh- 
ing at the energy of Rhoda's assertions, while 
their blind nationality confirmed him in his 
judgment of her character ; " I fear. Miss 
Knightly, that the people, at least, of Ireland, 
must undergo a similar, and I hope, more pro- 
bable change, ere / can be in love with them^ 

" Poor people I and what will they do now for 
any one to be in love with them .''" said Rhoda. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 69 

*' Mamma," resuming the subject, (which ob- 
viously rankled in her little female vanity, as 
much, perhaps, as in her national pride) — as all 
sat in the garden after dinner; " Mamma, which 
is, Ireland, or England, the handsomer country ?" 

" Handsome, is a very odd word, Rhoda.*** i 

" Now, mamma, you do know what I mean ; 
which has the best hills and rivers, roads and 
mountains, fields and houses?" 

*^ England the best, Rhoda." 

" Fye, Mamma ! Higher mountains, and 
finer rivers than Ireland ?" 

" No, Rhoda ; nor finer fields either ; but 
the hills and rivers, fields and roads, and all, 
are better in England, because they are turned 
to a better account ; and as to the houses, Rhor 
da, if you take in the houses of every rank, they 
are finer and better too." 

" INIamma, are the people better and finer ?" 
persisted Rhoda, not discomfited, though raor^ 
tified. 

. " How, better, my love ?" 

" Are they kinder, or more polite, or more 
friendly, or handsome, or agreeable ?" 

«« No, Rhoda." 

" Are they near as much ?" 



70 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" The English, I think, are not, generally 
speaking, a handsomer people ; as kind, and as 
friendly as the Irish they may be, amongst 
themselves ; but in their way of showing kind- 
ness and friendship, by the thousand little ways 
that it can be shown, the live-long day, they 
disappoint Irish notions and feelings; and, 
therefore, as I am Irish, I must call them our 
inferiors in those things, Rhoda.'" 

" The lady mistakes what true, unostenta- 
tious civility means," reflected Gerald. 

*' Mamma, do you like the English ?" 

" Perhaps, Rhoda, I have not seen sufficient 
of English society to answer you fairly." 

*' I 'm sure of that, madam," continued Ge- 
rald to himself. 

" But I may say that the lower orders here 
in the country, at least, are more abrupt, more 
uncommunicative, and perhaps more selfish than 
those of their class I've been used to in Ireland ; 
and as to the few circles of English ladies I 
have had the honour to mix in, they are perfect 
ladies indeed ; that is, perfectly at their ease ; 
but, somehow, they do not leave me quite so.'' 

" How can you expect it, good lady ?" Ge- 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 71 

raid went on to himself: — " to feel at ease, one 
must be used to one's company." 

" Perhaps I might, in a little time, become 
more at home with them," resumed Mrs. 
Knightly. 

" Too late for that," pursued Gerald. 

" I give a strange turn to our conversation 
by saying that the beggars of England — the 
few of them who now and then take courage to 
address you on a private road — I do not like at 
aU." 

" A strange turn indeed," thought Gerald.

— do, if you please, ma'am — if you please,

— is the usual extent of an English beggar's ap- 
peal: how inferior," continued Mrs. Knightly, 
smiling, and assuming the broadest brogue she 
had ever heard in her country ; " how inferior. 
Lady Augusta, my love, to the downright ora- 
tory of the Irish mendicant : ' Give us a penny, 
only a little penny, your honour's ladyship, and 
God's blessing on your kith and kin ; give us, 
and may you have a long life, a happy death, 
and a favourable judgment !' " 



T2 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

While Augusta and Rhoda laughed heartily 
at this sally, intentionally made for the amuse- 
ment of the former, Gerald felt his tastes more 
inconvenienced than ever, and said to himself, 
** Ay, and this is a sample of the drollery that 
Walter spoke to me of, and which, with sharper 
eyes than mine, he noticed before." 

" Jump up, Rhoda, and dance us a jig on 
that plot, Augusta's favourite one, the Kerry 
jig, and she will thrum it to you," continued 
Mrs. Knightly, placing a guitar in Augusta's 
hands. 

Up jumped Rhoda, and to the rapid time 
given by her friend, performed a dance so un- 
measuredly wild and peculiar, although so viva- 
cious and expressive, that Gerald, in the sur- 
prise and misgivings it created in him, lost all 
sensitiveness to its merits, if indeed it possessed 
any. The ease and exhilaration with which the 
beautiful Irish child performed it was lost on 
him, too, in doubts of the seemliness of her va- 
garies. A little Indian, he thought (though 
here his knowledge of exactly what kind of 
thing an Indian dance is, failed him), might 
have accomplished movements as eccentric, and 
indeed as interesting. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 73 

" How did you learn the tune, Augusta ?" 
he asked, after Rhoda, panting, and with flam- 
ing cheeks and eyes, and hair shaken into a mop, 
sat down. 

" Oh, Rhoda taught me, to be sure." 

** And Rhoda will teach you the jig, too," 
said her companion. 

" Yes, my love, in a little time," added Mrs. 
Knightly. 

" Not if I can help it," cogitated Gerald. 

In fact, for some days that he spent in their 
cottage, Gerald saw nothing but additional rea- 
sons why, in conjunction with his brother and 
his two most important guardians, he should 
take measures to put an end to the close ac- 
quaintance between Lady Augusta and her very 
Irish friends. Negligence of manner he de- 
fined to himself to be the most charitable name 
he could bestow on almost every thing they 
did; and Irishism and brogue ran, sufficiently 
strong to injure, through their language and 
accent. The only question he had to debate 
was, whether or not his sister would, without re- 
gret, or even with a little, that might not prove 
a check to her improving health, consent to a

speedy separation from persons who had ob- 
viously won her heart. 

Upon the evening previous to his departure 
from Devonshire, as he and Augusta walked 
out together, he proposed the matter indirectly. 

" Now that you are so much recruited, Au- 
gusta, you will take up your former studies 
again, of course, and join your governess and 
masters." 

** Oh yes, Gerald ; let my masters come as soon 
as possible ; — but pray tell my guardians, that 
since my meeting with Mrs. Knightly, I love 
her — though she is not a governess — and yet, she 
promises, offers, to do any thing for me, along 
with Rhoda. I love her above all the gover- 
nesses in the world, and would rather stay with 
her." 

" But Mrs. Knightly cannot return with you 
to London, Augusta." 

" And why need I return to London, 
Gerald?" 

" Because in London alone, dear Augusta, 
can you meet that society and companionship 
which is to perfect your mind and manners for 
joining the circles in which your birth entitles, 
indeed commands, you to move." 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 76 

" Oh, no one in the world is like Mrs. 
Knightly ! so good, so kind, so gentle, so in- 
structive ! and no child in the world half so 
delightful as Rhoda!" 

" Augusta, Mrs. Knightly and Rhoda must 
soon go home to Ireland, you know." 

" Then I will go with them. Oh, dear 
Gerald, tell Walter, and tell our guardians, 
this — Mrs. Knightly and her dear, dear girl 
have snatched me from the grave, and — " she 
became so agitated that Gerald repented of his 
premature plan; and, after all, was compelled 
to avoid any determination, which might have 
the effect of distressing, if it did not deprive 
him of an only sister.

CHAPTER V. 

" Ay, here," said Gerald, as, five summers 
after his visit to Devonshire, he sauntered back, 
upon a glowing August evening, by the beau- 
tiful St. Neot's road, to the Colleges of Cam- 
bridge, whence, some hours previously, he had 
issued forth to walk, — *' here are the pursuits 
and the recollections that at a fit age fill the 
minds of Englishmen with the elements of suc- 
cess in upholding their country's grandeur, or 
in impressing individually their own characters. 

" Here, by treading in the almost visible 
footsteps of wisdom and genius, they learn to 
be great themselves, and to leave behind, for 
successive generations, the added impulses of 
their own fame, that so, the national mind, ever 
gathering power to go on, may, in an immea- 
surable sweep of light, be shot into futurity. 

** Is it, indeed, mere fanciful language to say 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 77 

that around me, as I walk and ponder, the spirits 
of the Living-Dead speak to my spirit ? Though 
the corners of the intellectual earth be familiar 
with their names, have they not, among these 
leafy shades, and through the cloisters of yon 
superb group of academies, more than upon 
any other place on earth, breathed out their aU 
but palpable essence ? Can I stand at New- 
ton's casement, and not lift up my eyes, as if 
with him, in reverential daring towards the de^ 
serts of space ? Can I, by his side who sung of 
Heaven and Hell, sit under his time-worn tree, 
and not catch some echo of the imaginings that 
at one moment brought him angels' whispers 
from the bowers of Paradise, and, at another^ 
the thunders of God, rolled over the serene of 
Heaven, or launched after the rebellious, down 
the ' vast profound,' — the bellowing horror — 
the rattling of the wheels of Almighty war — 
the clash of the shields and spears — ' the tri- 
umph and the shouting ?' 

" In many situations, England, may thy cha^ 
racter be estimated ; amid thy thronged resorts 
of commerce, in thy senates, in the countless 
streets of thy empress-city, or amid the teeming 
perfection of thy fields. But here is the ground

lect flourishes !

tics and scoffers the religious doctrines that 
comfort thee; who built up thy learned name

who, mindful of the classic garlands that beau- 
tify the awful brows of Antiquity, wove for thy 
brows a chaplet of unequalled song !

all, can one connected with thy unfamed as well 
as unfortunate Island-sister, avoid feeling impa- 
tient of the accidental tie that thus half keeps

" But may not such a man take advantage of 
his original claims to thee, his early education, 
almost nursing on thy bosom, his innate sym- 
pathy with every thing that is thine, and aban- 
doning, with indifference or disgust, though 
perhaps with some regret, a connexion which 
only embarrasses him, fix his foot proudly on 
English soil, and cry, " I also am an Eng- 
lishman !" 

Gerald, treading loftier as he ended his re- 
verie, gained his chambers, and soon after, 
those of a friend in Trinity, who, upon that 
day, entertained a dinner party. Among the 
guests were three or four Irishmen, egotistically 
vain of their country, and ostentatious of the 
display of a certain genteel swagger of manner, 
which characterised, though, I allow, in a 
stronger shape, some of their compatriots coeval 
with Fighting Fitzgerald, and which is, perhaps, 
not quite worn down amongst themselves at the 
present day : — ^it may, indeed, be almost always 
e5

detected, however highly it is polished, when 
English gentlemen and Irish gentlemen come 
closely together. 

My hero had not before observed it, and now, 
particularly in the continuance of his late mood, 
it seemed disagreeably apparent. Not even ap- 
proaching to unseemliness, properly speaking, 
this peculiarity was marked by perhaps a pac- 
ing gait, or an air of the head, or a rapidity or 
bluutness of assertion, or a quickness of tone 
(to say nothing of brogue), that Gerald knew 
not well how to criticise, or did not care to lose 
time in criticising, except by the one epithet — 
Irish. Even the national vivacity of his new 
acquaintances, their play of eye and counte- 
nance, their humour, sometimes their wit, had 
an engrossing, eager, exhibiting way with it, 
which, he thought, sprang from a resolve to 
appear important, where there was a chance of 
appearing the contrary. It was the brisk asser- 
tion of doubtful claims; uneasiness making itself 
easy ; in fact. Irishmen anticipating equality, if 
not more, with Englishmen. " Cannot these men 
sit quieter, and sometimes sip their wine, without 
interrupting their own good things, and talk a 
little less loud, and, in a word, do as others 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 88 

do ?'^ he asked himself : " Cannot they perceive, 
in the persons of their English associates, that a 
gentleman who has no fears concerning his own 
respectability, ceases to trouble his head about 
it : always assured, however, that his very com- 
posure on the subject gives the best evidence of 
his claims?" 

And some time after, he made another reflec- 
tion : — " If these men, who are not mere Irish 
either, for they are Protestants, and of English 
derivation — and hark ! how they blunder and 
squabble amongst themselves about the great 
bone of contention, Catholic Emancipation — but 
if they have learned all this at home, what, 
upon his own soil, must be the genuine Hiber- 
nian — papist, politician, and with an O to his 
name ?" 

As the night advanced, Gerald was strength- 
ened in his disinclination to be intimate with 
his Irish companions. First, it appeared, that, 
after volunteering some common national toasts, 
such as " Erin-go-bragh," or " Ireland, the 
right arm of England," &c. they began, during 
quick revolutions of the wine, to deprive them- 
selves, inch by inch, of almost all the ground 
for love of country which, it might well be sup- 



84 THE ANGLO-IRISH/ 

posed, had previously supplied their position. 
They called the peasantry of Ireland besotted 
in superstition, indolent, savage, and treache- 
rous ; their priests, illiterate, clownish, bigoted, 
officious, and an incubus on the mind of the 
country ; the middle ranks of the Catholics, 
who were starting into professional, or mercan- 
tile, or agricultural importance, they described 
as pert, or rude, or vain, or ill-mannered : they 
admitted that there was no living quietly or 
even safely in their beloved country ; and that, 
in fact, one had better live any where else on 
the face of the earth ; so that having thus de- 
nounced about three parts in four of the popu- 
lation of Ireland, and farther proved it to be 
the best place in the world to live out of, the 
previous reasons for their patriotism seemed 
rather debateable. " They would, if they knew 
how," Gerald continued to think, " assert them* 
selves what I am, English-Irish ; at all events, 
when even they admit such good causes for it, 
I can well afford to defend my principles." 

" The small hours," as the Hibernians called 
them, continued to strike on, and other things, 
more national, appeared in their conduct. One 
got so inconvenienced with wine, that his fellow- 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 85 

countrymen were obliged, with much loud mer- 
riment, to bear him off, between them, to his 
chambers. Having returned to their host, and 
sat about an hour longer, no one at table, al- 
though they were not yet quite inebriated, talk- 
ed a tenth part so much as they. Their theme, 
too, was local Irish politics, little interesting to 
English gentlemen ; and " a difference of opi- 
nion," as defined by Sir Lucius, soon occurring, 
they quite monopolized the conversation, and 
at last two of them really quarrelled. With 
feelings of mixed indignation and shame, Ge- 
rald saw the chambers of his high-born, well- 
balanced English friend, become the arena for 
nonsensical discussion, and still more silly alter- 
cation, between a few abrupt, though high- 
blooded. Irishmen, too. None of the English 
portion — the majority — of the company thought 
it worth while to interfere ; and one of the dis- 
putants stalked away, muttering to his antago- 
nist threats of a reckoning in the morning. 

At length the whole party broke up, and Ge- 
rald was, against his will, compelled to walk to- 
wards Queen's, with the two Irishmen not yet 
disposed of; they and he were members of that 
college. ' 



86 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

Upon the way they would call to inquire 
after the friend whom, some hours before, they 
had helped to remove from table and deposit in 
bed, and Gerald was strongly pressed to accom- 
pany them. He did so from a watchful curio- 
sity. They knocked loudly at the outer door 
of their friend's apartment ; sleepy groans an- 
swered them. They increased their noise, and 
at last awoke the disturbed snorer, who, 
without stirring, exhorted them— to go to the 
devil. 

The college had been undergoing some slight 
repairs; they procured large stones in the 
court, and, in one crash, stove in the pannel of 
the outer door, until the lock of the inner one 
appeared, with the key turned in the keyhole. 
One of them then displayed a phial of some of- 
fensive-smelling drug ; spilt it on a coil of 
tow ; introduced the tow thus saturated through 
the key-hole, applied a candle to it, and await- 
ed the result. From what did result, it would 
seem that the still half-tipsy sleeper had been 
provoked beyond the bounds of temper, or, in- 
deed, sanity, by the atrocious fumigation that 
soon reached him. He must have staggered, 
very carefully, out of bed, and with almost savage 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 87 

precaution arranged his measures of vengeance ; 
for those abroad did not catch the sound of his 
motions until, suddenly, the lock shot back, and 
through the partially-opened door came the 
snap and flash — fortunately but in the pan — of 
a pistol. " And this," said Gerald, as, much 
shocked and disgusted, he turned homeward, 
leaving his companions to settle their affairs as 
they could — *' this, I suppose, I am to regard 
as a model of Irish humour and hilarity." 

Before retiring to bed he sat down, late as 
it was, to revise the heads of a speech which he 
intended to deliver, the next evening, at the 
Union Debating Society, when the question pro- 
posed for debate was the policy of England to- 
wards Ireland. Some arguments in advocacy 
of Irish pretensions to a more liberal policy, 
which in a benevolent humour Gerald had pre- 
viously arranged, he now felt half inclined to 
leave out. But he reflected that, although he 
had just got good cause to be vexed with indi- 
viduals of the country, the principles previous- 
ly weighed remained unaltered ; and, checking 
his impatience with his better judgment, he laid 
down his emendating pen, and went to rest. 

Upon the following evening the debate was 



88 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

opened, to a thronged meeting, by Gerald's young 
host of the preceding night. The speaker's first 
step was to show, that in the legislation of this 
country for Ireland, particularly since the reign 
of Henry VIII. as well as in the conduct of the 
English Lords of the Pale, Lord-deputies, or 
Lord-lieutenants, almost down to the present 
day, the sister country had been rather coerced 
than invited, rather driven than led into a con- 
nexion. This stated, the speaker then endea- 
voured to prove that different measures might 
have better succeeded in leaving, at the present 
hour, that connexion in a more settled and hap- 
py, and, for the interests of both countries, ad- 
vantageous state. Conciliation would, he argued, 
from the nature of things, have proved better 
policy than coercion. It would also have formed 
a generous and noble policy. And, he con- 
cluded by endeavouring to convince his hearers 
that, apart either from strict political specula- 
tions, or the attention of Englishmen to their 
own sense of national interest and honour, Ire- 
land, from the outset, had deserved the treat- 
ment he would recommend. 

From the little Gerald knew, and the much 
he imagined of Irish self-opinion, he believed 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 89 

that few of his genuine countrymen would have 
felt greatly indebted to this vein of advocacy. 
The high English feeling which ran through it, 
seemed, even in the very effort at vindication, 
to acknowledge how little Ireland had ever yet 
done towards commanding the respect, and, 
through it, the considerate indulgence of Eng- 
land. Sincere as was the speaker, he seldom 
warmed in his subject, as if he doubted either 
its possible effect on his audience, or its want of 
materials to enable him to convince his hearers. 
He appeared aware that those who followed 
him rather condescended to do so, than believed 
themselves called on even to discuss such a ques- 
tion. His charges against English deputies and 
generals were timid, or made in the abstract; 
and when he strove to urge the claims of Ire- 
land, it was by appealing to the lofty minds and 
virtuous hearts of Englishmen, to assist him in 
discovering such claims ; thus arming national 
pride against national prejudice, sooner than run 
the risk of pleading the cause of Ireland upon 
merits of her own. 

" The honourable opener" sat down amid few 
plaudits, and was followed and replied to by an 
M. A., many years his elder, who, in a very 



WB THB ANGLO-IRISH. 

matured style of oratory, mixed with cutting 
satire, seemed, if the cheers of the assembly were 
evidence, completely to dispose of the subject. 

He denied that the firm measures adopted by 
this country to keep her footing in Ireland ever 
came under the name of coercion. They natu- 
rally sprang up in self-defence, from the conti- 
nued turbulence, breach of faith, and atrocities 
committed, century after century, upon the 
English settlers of the Pale, and afterwards 
upon the English settlers every where spread 
through Ireland. In this view, no policy but 
a strong and severe one could have emanated 
from British councils, unless Englishmen would 
consent to show themselves pusillanimous in the 
face of savage violence ; — no — not even for the 
sake of the honied epithets with which the ho- 
nourable mover was willing to disguise what 
must have been the real designation of the po- 
licy he proposed. As to the merits of Ireland, 
in this question — the point could scarce be ap- 
proached without a laugh. The answer given 
to the honourable opener"*s first proposition, con- 
tained an answer to that. If the strong policy 
of England had always been called forth by a 
succession of Irish misconduct, where were the 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 91 

claims of Ireland to a different policy ? To this 
day, where were her claims? In loyalty, in ci- 
vilization, in learning, in arts, or manufactures, 
where were they ? — Must we turn to 1798, or 
even to Captain Rock, of 18 — , for an answer 
to the former part of the question ; to T. C. D. 
for an answer to the next part of it ; and to the 
linen looms of the colonial and Protestant North, 
the only looms in Ireland, for an answer to the 
last ? 

Though Gerald felt this speech, as it has been 
described, one indicative of oratorical power and 
facility in the speaker, he also felt that, consi* 
dered by itself, and applied to the subject in 
hand, it was deficient in depth, in information, 
in philosophy, and even in reflection. The ac- 
complished M. A. confessedly one of the best- 
prepared speakers on other occasions, had not, 
he thought, vouchsafed to muster, for the present 
one, much in addition to the general and some- 
times loose notions and facts with which, upon 
Irish questions. Englishmen are often content- 
ed. It showed, therefore, in detail, common- 
place invective, recollected from school-books, 
or from histories read in boyhood, or, since that 
time, unconsciously gleaned out of pamphlets, 



92 THB ANGLO-IRISH. 

newspaper " leaders," or occasional conversa* 
tions. And yet, although thus meagre in mat- 
ter, it struck him as delivered in a feeling of 
superiority to all objections, such as should 
legitimately mark only the infelt possession of 
extensive knowledge and lengthened deliberation. 
Perhaps, spite of himself, his Irish blood pre- 
ponderated over its English admixture, when, for 
a moment, he accused the speech of some haugh- 
ty indifference to a thorough intimacy with its 
subject, growing out of a too-English contempt 
for Ireland, and an over-readiness to believe in 
national infallibility. Yet he really objected 
more to the want of material it evinced, than to 
the principles it asserted : to its almost audaci- 
ous jumping upon conclusions, than to the con- 
clusions themselves — provided the speaker had 
entitled himself to make them. For, above all 
other considerations, Gerald was sufficiently 
English to feel a degree of personal pride when- 
ever England's character was properly upheld. 

He rose third in the debate, and almost with- 
out agreeing with the first speaker, or conflict- 
ing with the second, delivered an oration ex- 
pressive of his own long-cherished views on the 
question. We are prepared to expect that the 
policy Gerald at once recommended from Eng. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH, 9^ 

land towards Ireland was that which should, by 
all possible means, tend to make the people of 
Ireland " English-Irish." In this light, such 
policy ought to be free from every thing that, 
by irritating the Irish against the English, 
could keep up a feeling of national dislike, and 
consequently perpetuate national distinctions, 
and thereby check the progress of his plan. If 
a perfectly good understanding between the two 
people were first created, all the stations of su- 
periority which England holds would soon be- 
get a zeal of emulation among her neighbours ; 
assimilation would ensue, and with it, Ireland 
would lose her distinct character, and grow into 
what she ought to be — and what it is the inte- 
rest of both countries she should really become — 
one large, integral portion of England. So far, 
Gerald carried with him all his auditors. When 
however, he began to suggest in what instances 
his good-natured policy must show itself; when 
he asserted that it should dispense with penal 
restrictions or precautions, many murmurs in- 
terrupted him ; and no sooner had he uttered 
the words " Catholic Emancipation," than he 
was greeted with a chorus of groans. In vain 
did he explain that this part of his system went 
to tear up by the roots Irish Catholicism itself; 



94 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

that hitherto restrictions had provoked that 
religion into its present predominance in Ire- 
land ; while if left to its own chance, without 
the important stimulus of state-jealousy, it 
might now be even numerically insignificant. 
All that Gerald could say was of no avail to 
silence the disapprobation of his zealous though 
indeed not numerous opponents. 

After he had sat down, many inferior speeches 
were made, which tired him, as well with the ora- 
tors as with the subject. Amongst those, Ireland 
had her advocates in common with her accusers; 
but the shallowness of both, whether in eulogy 
or blame, defence, or vituperation, was equally 
obvious. Some spoke set essays, supplied 
mostly by a yearning imagination; the theme 
looked poetical, and they would try their 
flowery sentences on it: and some allowed to 
escape them a tirade of every-day bigotry, not 
extenuated even by the boyish faults of fancy ; 
they were going into the church, and would not 
miss such an occasion to show their shallow zeal. 
Altogether, the want of real information, or, as 
before observed, even thought, in the debate, 
surprised Gerald ; and, so far as he yet had an 
Irish feeling to be wrought upon, humiliated 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 95 

him. For, this want did not arise from any 
lack of ability to remedy it, in the debaters, 
but purely from a lack of interest, and the 
habit of not paying attention to Irish concerns. 
While he could smile, therefore, at the violent 
ignorance of an embryo church dignitary, he 
was more than ever ashamed of his paternal 
country, which did not command, among the 
more liberal of his associates, sufficient acquire- 
ment to put the fool down. Nor did he think 
himself at liberty to be angry with his friends 
on account of their habitual indifference on the 
point : " For," ruminated Gerald, " Ireland 
presents such a mass of confused and disagree- 
able matter to the eye of an inquirer, originally 
uninterested about her, that we may well ex- 
cuse the natural inclination to ease and pleasure 
with which he turns from the task of exploring 
and arranging the heap, to continue mental 
pursuits that have always brought him en- 
joyment."

CHAPTER VI. 

The day upon which it is necessary that 
Gerald should again come before the reader, 
occurs nearly two years after the time of the 
last chapter, when he appears deeply interested 
in the perusal of a letter received from his 
brother. 

"MY DEAR GERALD, 

" Now, at least, in the possession of all the 
college honours and titles a gentleman of your 
rank need desire to attain, we cannot help feel- 
ing anxious for your arrival in town. You seem, 
yourself, quite aware that no more time should 
be lost in deciding upon your future course : 
and while none of your friends feel inclined in 
the least degree to bias your choice, it is only 
natural for all of them to wish the choice made. 
If you retain your predilection for the bar, pray 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 97 

let us soon have the pleasure of seeing you 
dining in Lincoln's Inn. Should your thoughts 
have, since we last spoke together, turned 
towards an official life, the path is open for you. 
Indeed, I can say as much, as well from my 
own little interest, resulting from my peer's 
seat, as from the assurances of our friends high 
in office. In either case, we trust you will 
speedily bring your talents — (amongst them 
your oratorical ones not forgotten) — to an ho- 
nourable trial, by going into the Lower House 
for one of the boroughs to which I am so anx- 
ious to nominate you. 

" By the end of the approaching recess, at 
all events, we hope to see you fairly started to- 
wards whatever goal your deliberations may 
propose as a fit object of accomplished ambition; 
and, as a preparatory step, your farewell to the 
academic shades of old Cambridge, and your 
appearance amongst us, are, I repeat, every day 
looked for. 

"Augusta, though I hope perfectly re-esta- 
blished in health, goes once more to Ireland this 
morning. She travels with the young and 
pretty Lady Cox, whom you met in town a few 
months ago, spending the first months after 

VOL. I. F 



98 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

marriage with her lively, though quite Irish fox- 
hunter, Sir Richard ; — (by the way, Gerald, you 
admitted that the almost childish bride was pret- 
ty.) But though Augusta only speaks of pass- 
ing some time with this happy pair in Dublin, 
and afterwards at their country-seat, I fear, in- 
deed I believe, she will not return to England 
without paying as long a visit, at least, to her 
old friends the Knightly s ; for, unfortunately, as 
I understand, the baronet's mansion and Mr. 
Knightly's great farm-house are not far asunder. 
I have not lately, any more than yourself, 
preached to Augusta on the head of her rooted 
predilections ; it is not part of our system to- 
wards an only and dearly-loved sister, afflicted 
as she has been, to wound her even misdirected 
feelings ; and then, she is too good and gentle 
to be scared with a parade of paternal autho- 
rity ; to say nothing of her being now almost 
her own mistress — for Augusta is nearly twenty. 
Let us hope, notwithstanding her long intimacy 
in an Irish circle, not even of the higher class, 
that her previous English education, the super- 
intendence of the English governess who, after 
your visit to Devonshire, accompanied her to 
Ireland, and her late introduction among fash- 
ionable people here, will not leave much, if any 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 99 

thing, to disquiet us on her account, or on our 
own. Indeed, have we not agreed, when you 
were last in town, that, excepting only a few 
slight peculiarities, our sister was all that a 
high-born and accomplished woman need be ? 

" Perhaps my real uneasiness on account 
of Augusta's present journey to Ireland, arises 
from the increasing disturbance and misery of 
that turbulent and most miserable country. 
For, by the latest information received in Lon- 
don, Captain Rock has just acquired, parti- 
cularly in the southern counties, a formidable 
colleague in his devastations. Famine and he 
now co-operate among the hills, and bogs, and 
deserts of Ireland ; while disease, plague, in fact, 
under the name of typhus fever, may be said 
to bring up their rear. Yet, here in England, it 
seems a plentiful and healthy season. What 
peculiar curse can have blasted the crops, and, 
above all, the potatoe crop, of green Erin ? 

*' My letters from my Irish agent, are ample 
evidence to me of the state of things I describe. 
No rents ; no lease-premiums; no renewal-pre- 
miums. In some instances, he in vain ejects the 
cotters and small farmers, who will not pay him 
a shilling ; for either the ground remains unlet, 
or Captain Rock shoots, burns, or drives away,

100 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

a new tenant. In other instances, illegal pos- 
session is kept, and, again under the patronage 
of the doughty chieftain, the law of the dear 
land becomes dead letter. So much to gratify 
your lurking interest about Irish affairs. I 
will add, that a renewed discussion of the Catho- 
lic Claims comes on after the recess ; and, so far 
as, with certain barriers still unremoved, success 
can be anticipated, the friends of the measure 
are sanguine. 

" Will you not think of qualifying yourself 
to take a part, if only by voting, in a question 
that I know you have considered ? Come to us 
then, prays. 

My dear Gerald, 

Your brother and friend, 
CLANGORE." 

*' Yes, indeed, I did think her pretty — very 
pretty," was the first reflection with which, 
strange as it may seem, Gerald laid down this 
epistle, nor did his thoughts engage him in 
other topics, till he had added — " Certainly 
the best specimen of an English-Irish lady, 
educated and living in Ireland, I have seen ; 
for all her tastes, or rather propensities, were 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 101 

English : what a pity she had not an English 
husband;"" and perhaps an impudent though 
faint piece of vanity, suggesting to hira that 
the young Lady Cox had seemed, during the 
short period of their acquaintance, to recipro- 
cate the good opinion he had evinced of her, 
formed the conclusion of Gerald's reveries on 
this point. 

** The law is a fine profession/' was his next 
mental soliloquy : ** to say nothing of its rank in 
old France, its Court influence, and its order of 
Knighthood, we have the names of Lyttleton, 
Coke, Mansfield, Thurlow, Erskine, to ennoble 
it at home. The only thing I cannot under- 
stand in it is, how a man shall state, for a 
guinea, as truth and fact, what he even sus- 
pects to be falsehood or subterfuge; or how, 
after pleading to-day the cause of oppressed 
innocence, or of outraged virtue, he can stand up 
to-morrow the infelt apologist of tyranny, vice, 
or profligacy. Allowing its full force to the 
term professional advocacy ; allowing him to 
be but the machine through which a bad or 
false client chooses to make certain assertions ; 
still he is a conscious machine ; still he knows 
such assertions to be founded in fallacy, or 



102 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

worse ; so that, after all, that is the very pro- 
blem I cannot solve. And it becomes more 
enigmatical, when we suppose this professional 
machine endowed with commanding professional 
talents, which must send strongly recommended 
to a jury-box the worst cause he may state — 
merely state; for, in this view, he is not only 
the speaking machine of a bad principle, but, 
to all intents and purposes, the aider and 
abettor of vice — the promoter of its possible 
success. Again : supposing, in any one in- 
stance, such success attained ; suppose the op- 
pressor of the widow or of the orphan trium- 
phant in his false though ingenious arguments, 
conveyed through the conscious and helping 
advocate ; in what self-applause, in what self- 
estimation, in what peace of heart and dignity 
of mind, can that advocate come home from 
the forensic arena and sit down among his 
family and friends? The kind of man I have 
before my imagination is possessed, naturally, 
of honour, of simple, unargumentative ho 
nour; — by what process of the most subtle 
the most professional casuistry, shall he quite 
convince himself that, partly by his agency, 
the widow's tears that moment do not flow 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 103 

and the orphan's cries do not that moment 
rise up before another tribunal ? These, 
however," added Gerald, " are not charges, 
but loose notions, merely: I will speak, the 
first opportunity, to some really high-minded 
man amongst them, who must have to con- 
sider my questions every day ; perhaps he can 
satisfy me." 

Meantime he felt no disinclination to consi- 
der the alternative of an official life, proposed 
by his brother. Lord Clangore. 

" A man can be eminently useful in the ser- 
vice of his country," he continued, " and Parlia- 
ment presents an opportunity for showing claims 
for getting on ; but I will go into office, and 
into the House, too, unrestricted by the political 
principles of my friends ;" — he rose and walked 
to his window, strong in the thought — " that is, 
if I go at all into either. We shall see ; I '11 
satisfy Walter, and be visible in town at once ; 
there, a few words can settle it, better than a 
year's debating here — come ! and now for the 
world at last !" 

Such of my readers as vividly recollect the 
almost agitating egotism in which they have first 
received or adopted plans for their great change 



104 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

from the theoretic bustle of youth to the real 
business of life, will understand Gerald's sensa- 
tions, as, step after step, round his chamber, he 
continued to pace himself through all the im- 
portant possibilities of manhood. His nerves 
seemed to knit stronger, his head grew more 
erect, his brows bent in anticipated abstrusive- 
ness ; events to come, in their elementary con- 
fusion at least, appeared to buzz and roll through 
his brain. Many situations of effort and re- 
sponsibility started up before his imagination, 
of which the whole accomplishment and dis- 
charge rested on his shoulders — and promptly 
and energetically, and with surprising success, 
did he see himself act in all. 

It is a delightful hour, as delightful in recol- 
lection as in experience, and that does not often 
happen, when the young, ingenuous, and gifted 
mind, just spreading its pinions for flight from 
the flowery verge of philosophy into the barren 
truths of things, thus waves them to and fro, 
in real strength, although in but fanciful achieve- 
ment ! 

In his abridged prospect of all he might be 
called on to do, Gerald did not forget the chal- 
lenging situation of Ireland ; but, after a few 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 105 

calmer thoughts in detail upon that subject, 
and a reference to the facts of his brother's let- 
ter, he could but say, " wretched country !" and 
turn from it, once more to plunge into his more 
general reveries. 

" Ay, wretched, wretched country !" Gerald 
resumed, as, upon his coming up to town from 
Cambridge, which speedily followed the receipt 
of Lord Clangore's letter, he saw, from the 
windows of his carriage, whilst whirled through 
the northern outskirts of the city, bill after 
bill, placard after placard, posted, or borne on 
polls, on men's shoulders, of which the large, 
inch-long capital letters of each proclaimed — 
" FAMINE IN IRELAND ; — " Public meeting." 

" The affluent and happy of affluent and hap- 
py England, Avill now subscribe a million and 
half;" he said ; " and yet, as soon as the 
scarce-felt donation has been bestowed, know as 
little of the causes, whatever they may be, 
which, in this appalling effect, call for an exer- 
cise of their mixed benevolence and pride — (yes, 
Rochefoucauld, thou art right in thy theory of 
mixed motives) — as they have done during nearly 
eight hundred years, of — to say the best of it, — 
disgusting connexion between the two Islands • 
F 5 



106 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

know ?" continued Gerald, with a sigh, made 
up, as was the philosophy he praised, of blend- 
ed sentiments — " ay ! or care, either." 

Proceeding along Oxford-street towards 
Grosvenor-square, some obstruction, caused by 
the crossing and entanglement of vehicles of 
every description, occurred, and, while he stood 
still, Gerald was able more attentively to re- 
gard some of the bills posted at either hand. 
Out of many, one particularly caught his eye. 
It was the play-bill of an actor, notorious for 
much besides great acting, and ran something 

in the following style ; — " Theatre Royal : 

Distressed Irish. Mr. — — — , in noticing his 
Benefit for Wednesday next, the 18th of — begs 
leave to announce, that it is his intention to 
evince his gratitude for the frequent and warm- 
hearted support experienced at the hands of an 
Irish public, by appropriating one-half of the 
receipts of that forthcoming benefit towards the 
relief of the present sufferers in Ireland." 

" Drive on. Sir I" cried Gerald, as soon as he 
had glanced over the sad stuff — " why do you 
stop ? — This is too bad ;" sinking back on his 
seat. And contempt for the impudent and, 
with all its stately-affected sentiment, the heart- 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 107 

less flourish of the actor, mingled with some 
Irish feelings not yet perfectly subdued in his 
bosom. " What ! can the unhappy country 
be indeed fallen so low as, in the face of a Bri- 
tish people, to allow of this speculating charity ? 
— Drive on. Sir.** — The meeting between the 
brothers, a few moments afterwards, was kindly 
and brother-like. 

They began to speak, almost immediately, 
about Gerald's views and pursuits ; Gerald deci- 
ded, to the manifest gratification of Lord Clan- 
gore, in favour of an official life. Their dis- 
tinguished countryman, the Minister, stood in 
need of a private secretary ; had intimated to 
Lord Clangore a wish to confer the situation 
on his brother ; an interview the next morning 
might at once settle the matter : and under no 
other auspices did it seem likely that a young 
candidate for public honours, of the description 
aimed at by Gerald, could start with such hopes 
of success. 

" His Lordship does not forget the political 
alliance and personal friendship he engaged in, 
at an early period of life, with our father, Ge- 
rald :" continued Lord Clangore — " With re- 
gard to me, he has already shown his recollec- 



108 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

tion of it ; perhaps you will find him still more 
zealous on your behalf: besides, he respects 
your talents, and esteems your character.*" 

" I will study to make some return for the 
honour his Lordship does me, Walter ; but *" 

** And only ask yourself, what other political 
tutor living is, all circumstances considered, so 
happily qualified to commence and advance 
your political education ?'^ — resumed Lord Clan- 
gore, his vivacity, if nothing else, producing an 
interruption of Gerald's " but." 

" I quite agree, Walter." 

" Then, immediately after the approaching 
recess, you can, as I before told you, step into 
your seat in the House ; and so go on, practi- 
cally and theoretically, together.'" 

*' Still I have to thank all my friends, and 
you among the number. Let me add, however, 
that I bring certain opinions — at least on the 
subject of our paternal country — into whatever 
situation I may have the honour to fill." 

" Very well— of course you do."" 

*' Some, indeed, in which you, for instance, 
do not happen to agree with me." 

" To be sure : every man in entitled to his 
opinions in every situation ; that is, if they are 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 109 

not very much opposed to the duties he binds 
himself to perform." 

" Pray, now, allow me to understand you, 
Walter. My vote, if nothing else, must always 
go for the full rescinding of — " 

" The laws against Roman Catholics," again 
interrupted Lord Clangore :— " so it can." 

" Yes ; but as you vote the other way, I 
suppose my notions on this question may not 
be thought compatible with the discharge of — 
as you just now said — the duties of any office I 
may hereafter hold." 

"I see no incompatibility in the matter. 
The minister himself is on your side." 

" I did not forget he was ; yet I doubted if 
either by him or by the majority of his cabinet 
colleagues, it would be thought strict etiquette, 
openly to recruit forces for a division-night." 

" Neither they nor he see much in it, I be- 
lieve," said Lord Clangore, with a slight ex- 
pression of official closeness of meaning — Ge- 
rald paused a moment, and quickly asked — 

" Our distinguished friend is, of course, 
to the fullest extent, in earnest upon this 
question ?"" 

" Of course — to the fullest possible extent." 



110 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

** Do you express him or yourself, Walter, 
in that parenthetic * possible ?' '^ 

" Perhaps only my own strong opinions were 
indicated by it ; speak to the minister on this 
point to-morrow, Gerald ; that will be the 
better way.*' 

" I will. The doubts and fluctuations of 
* possibility,' " continued Gerald, " are not con- 
templated, I should think, where a pledge is 
^ven." 

*' Come, come, reserve your case of con- 
science till to-morrow, I say : — now you are 
otherwise to engage yourself; we do not dine 
at home; for many days you have been in- 
cluded, with me, in an invitation for a small 
friendly dinner-party to the Secretary for 

the ; where, I believe, along with 

Lord Harmer, the Bishop of , and others 

of our true English-Irish cast, we shall meet 
the clever young Scotchman who writes so 
variously and well ;— bustle ; the carriage alrea- 
dy draws up." 

The Secretary's lady being at a watering- 
place, Gerald, in about half an hour, formed 
one of a dinner-party exclusively made up of 
his own sex. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. Ill 

The brothers found their host in his draw- 
ing-room, which by the introduction of a pile 
of books, reviews, pamphlets and manuscripts, 
all lying round him, or at the table to which 
he sat, he seemed, in the thus outraged ab- 
cence of the gentler portion of his family, to 
have half transformed into an occasional library, 
or, it might be, office. When the servant 
threw open the door, he appeared writing, 
very rapidly, and at the same time conversing 
with several gentlemen who were seated near 
him, or standing at the windows of the apart- 
ment. 

The first of these persons that fixed Gerald's 
glance was easily recognizable as the church 
dignitary mentioned by Lord Clangore. The 
Bishop's face, stature and air were imposing; 
health spoke out on his cheek, and spirit, if 
not command, or an inclination to command, 
in his eye. Beside him sat Lord Harmer, a 
very gentlemanlike old man, and with features 
that in youth must have been handsome ; now, 
however, his stilled blue eye, and a disposition 
in his lower jaw to send his chin dropping on 
his breast, betokened perhaps as much feeble- 
ness as amiabiUty of character; but when he 



112 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

rose to return Gerald's bow, as the Secretary 
presented them to each other, the great suavity 
of his manner ensured full respect. 

The individual next named to the brothers, 
for both had previously been unacquainted 
with him, was Mr. Gore, from the county 

of in Ireland. Gerald thought he should 

have discovered the gentleman's country with- 
out a verbal notification of it. At a first view, 
there was about him a sufficient portion of 
the elegant display of features and manner to 
which, particularly at Cambridge, our hero 
had been accustomed, in the persons of his 
Hibernian fellow-students. He rose up to 
his full height, and that was commanding, 
gracefully assumed his best position ; and, all 
the while that his round ruddy face glowed 
with smiles, and his expressive mouth insinu- 
atingly curved up at one side, slid off* a bow 
so exploded although so easy, that nothing 
but his absence from court during the last 
five or six years could have well excused it ; 
and Gerald deemed, so much having been 
done, there was an end, for the present, to 
civilities; but Mr. Gore, again assuming his 
full height, and stepping to the brothers with 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 113 

something of the noble style which Watteau 
has so well imparted to his minuet-moving 
old gallants, possessed himself, I cannot say 
unceremoniously, for it was the very perfec- 
tion of polite ceremony, of a hand of each, and 
in rich, not vulgar, Irish, made a handsome 
speech. 

" My dear Lord Clangore — my dear Mr. 
Blount, how happy to have the honour of meet- 
ing you — knew your distinguished and amiable 
father well, before his political duties placed 
him — highly for the advantage of his country, 
though much to the regret of his early friends, 
here in England ; — have been so fortunate to 
be presented to your accomplished sister, at my 
particular friend's — Sir Richard Cox's house, in 
Dublin — and often heard her speak, in delight- 
ful vivacity, of the brothers Lady Augusta 
esteems so warmly : Mrs. Gore and the Misses 
Gore also had the honour — ^" 

Taking advantage of a little pause, one of 
many that Mr. Gore usually made during his 
soft, measured way of speaking, Gerald, who in 
common with his brother had not yet heard 
from Lady Augusta, since her last journey to 
Ireland, asked how his sister did, if indeed, 



114 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

Mr. Gore meant a very recent meeting with her 
in Dublin ? 

Yes, — Mr. Gore meant a very recent meet- 
ing, indeed ; one of little more than two days 
old : it was his good fortune to meet Lady 
Augusta the very evening she arrived in Dub- 
lin, and she did indeed seem, after a little rest, 
quite refreshed, quite spirited and happy ; for, 
Mr. Gore continued, " he had himself got to 
London but this very morning; hurrying, in 
fact," and here his melodious voice sunk into a 
lower key, " to present himself, with the assis- 
tance of such kind friends as he could presume 
would do him a favour, to an official personage, 
concerning an official vacancy that had sudden- 
ly occurred at the other side of the water, and 
about which he would perhaps by and by snatch 
a disengaged moment to speak more to Lord 
Clangore.'* 

Bowing acquiescence to this intimation. Lord 
Clangore turned with a "Ha! Horseman town!" 
to a young nobleman about his own age, but, 
for his years, rather encumbered with flesh, 
who came from the recess of a window, slowly 
and somewhat pokingly, to accost him ; " I did 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 115 

not expect you would have so soon come over, 
this year." 

" Nor I," answered Lord Horsemantown, 
gravely. 

" How does Lord Vesey .''' 

" My father was well when I left him ;" still 
very seriously. 

" And how go on the crucibles and the al- 
kalis, and the grand elixir?" demanded Ge- 
rald, who was also intimate with his lordship. 

" I've got through no experiments, lately,*" 
he was answered ; the good-humoured satire of 
Gerald's question being either unnoticed, or, 
by the time the answer came, forgotten ; or 
perhaps it had never reached the young and 
noble chemist. 

'* By the way, Horsemantown, that business 
of my last letter to Augusta turned out a sad 
affair." 

" How do you mean ?'* 

'* Surely you cannot forget that, at her re- 
quest, you solemnly promised to receive in Ire- 
land, under cover for her, all the epistles I 
should write her from Cambridge ?" 

" No ; — I remember that." 



116 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" And, you know, you were to frank them 
and forward them, in course ?"" 

« Yes." 

" Did you strictly keep your covenant ?" 

" There ivas one letter, I believe," ruminated 
his lordship, aloud, as he bent his eyes in an 
effort upon the carpet: and he said no more. 

" Yes, and it lay on your table two months, 
/ believe," continued Gerald. 

" I don't know how it could have happened, 
then ; scarce a morning passed that I did not see 
it on the library table, and make up my mind 
to frank it ; Lord Vesey often heard me say 
so. I've been really much to blame, but cannot 
account for it ;"" and joining his hands with a 
little difficulty behind his back, he took two 
steps towards the window from which he had 
made his appearance, threw up his eyes and 
chin, and earnestly gazed out at the sky. 

" Account for it ! who expected that ?" asked 
a low middle-aged gentleman, habited, not 
smartly, in black, turning round from another 
window where he had been tete-a-tSte with a 
fine-looking, pale-cheeked, pale-browed person ; 
and, as he spoke, his sharp tones, and the set 
elevation of the muscle that raised his nostrils. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 117 

might betoken a man who, easily situated in 
life, is included in friendly dinner-parties for 
the privileged good things to which, without 
particular nicety to our sensitive feelings, he 
may choose to give utterance. Meantime his 
face, taken together, was not devoid of as much 
natural kindliness as its cynical habits allow- 
ed it to retain : and Gerald further perceived 
from his accent, and, indeed, from his uncere- 
monious, sometimes abrupt manner, that he was 
more purely English than the bland Mr. Gore, 
at least. 

" Let my good young friend alone. Gunning," 
said the Secretary, not looking up from the ruled 
paper which, occasionally glancing into books 
at either hand, he continued rapidly to cover 
with bold and dashing writing, that, to Gerald's 
sympathizing eye, bespoke original composition 
thrown off at the instant. There was ridicule 
in his tone, though, his friends would aver, good- 
nature in the motive for his words. Indeed, it 
was said that the Secretary thought kindly to- 
wards every human being ; only he had a bad 
way of showing it. And, " yes, bishop," he re- 
sumed in a breath ; " as you were saying, it is 
a great bore to write in one country, and print 



118 THE ANGL0-IRI8H. 

in another :" and still he pursued his seemingly 
necessary task of filling sheet after sheet. 

" So much so," answered the dignitary, " at 
least, after my experience of the fact, that I 
will never write again, unless, by some happy 
chance, my duties in Ireland allow, for a season, 
my attendance in London while the sheets go 
through the press." 

" Yet some of the folks, in Ireland, could 
sometimes spare your lordship," observed Mr. 
Gore, with his fine and insinuating smile. 

" Spare .'" cried the Secretary, while an ex- 
pression, elucidating his half-punnish application 
of the word, relaxed the sombre official cast of 
his not unclassic features : " Spare ! no — if those 
said ' some' had the bishop amongst them on 
a hill-side in the county of Tipperary — ask 
Daniel their man. But I believe acting on your 
experience of ' the trade/ — as the publishing 
and printing people call themselves — we owe 
your present appearance amongst us to an anx- 
iety to preside over your announced third edi- 
tion, Bishop." 

" I am, indeed, in London, duteously attend- 
ing the pleasure of these gentlemen, for that 
purpose." 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 119 

" How stupid I was," whispered Gerald to 
Mr. Priestly, the pale, grand-looking person 
before noticed as having been in conversation 
with Mr. Gunning. 

" Was r interrupted Gunning, clese at hand. 
Gerald smiled, as bound to do, at the intended 
smartness, and proceeded — " how could I, after 
finishing only yesterday the perusal of his theo- 
logical work, forget the dignatorial title of its 
author ?" 

" And while you but overlook your sheets 
at your leisure," continued the Secretary, after 
the Bishop's last word, " here am I compelled 
to do a little seeming rudeness, some of you 
may say affectation, while, in half an hour 
snatched from the more serious business of the 
day, I try to keep my promise — forced from 
me indeed — to send Murray a sheet this even- 
ing, for his * ever-gaping-wide-mouthed-wad- 
dling' Quarterly." 

" Oh, friends who know your responsibilities 
will not, as you suppose, think one thing or the 
other," resumed the Bishop. 

" Besides," said Mr. Gore, " the Secretary 
writes so fast, and with such little demand on his

attention, or loss to his friends, that, particularly 
when the public are to gain so much by it — " 

*'And the author he is reviewing;" inter- 
rupted Gunning, now sitting in the middle of 
the room, watchfully leaning on his stick. 

** No doubt, Sir," assented Mr. Gore, bowing 
and smiling: and Gunning and the Secretary 
sneered answering sneers, though their eyes had 
not met. 

** Yet I doubt if milady herself will agree," 
he went on. 

" Come, Gunning, no allusions," said the Se- 
cretary ; " I know you would give a pinch of 
snuff to ask — not pertinent questions ; — but you 
shall be left in the tortures of curiosity." 

" Well, I am not, at all events, an author 
in youi hands, Secretary ;" remarked Gunning. 

** Thank heaven for it, my good fellow." 

" How ! at escaping you ?" 

" No— 'tis a bad trade." 

" Have you always thought so .?" asked Gun- 
ning; and though no consciousness, not even 
a shade, came over the well disciplined face of 
the Secretary, Gerald felt, on his account, some 
pain at what he thought the rudeness of the 
question, inasmuch as, to his own honour, and 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 121 

that of the poor Nine, be it spoken — the secre- 
tary stood indebted to a clever local satire, 
in verse, for a first step towards his present 
considerable rank and importance in the official 
department of the first nation in the world. 

" Lady Morgan was much annoyed by the 
Quarterly review of her last book, however," 
said the matter-of-fact Lord Horsemantown, 
solemnly turning round after catching the latter 
part of this conversation. 

The door opening in good time, Mr. Stewart, 
Mr. Grady, and Mr. Pack, were announced. 

" That 's the very clev ^r Scotchman," said 
Lord Clangore to his brother, as a handsome 
young man, wearing clouds of black hair round 
his almost feminine features, walked across to 
the Secretary. 

*' And Mr. Grady is the editor of the even- 
ing paper, the quite a clever person, too; 

friendly, in his way, to our honourable Secre- 
tary." 

" Useful," emendated Gerald. i 

" You split words with me still, though you 
have left Alma-mater, at last," continued his 
brother, smiling as, with a show of being at 
home, and yet too many prefatory small bows,

the subject of their remarks glided after his 
friend Mr. Stewart. 

** I should add, Gerald, that the gentleman 
is, in one important sense, one of us ; English- 
Irish." 

" And the third gentleman, who stares so 
straight before him as he approaches his pro- 
foundly-respected host ?"" 

" A kind of little author, too," supplied the 
still over-hearing Mr. Gunning ; — *' comes from 
Connaught, they say ; and writes books about 
it , they say too ; — but I never believed that 
since the last time — and it was also the first 
time — I heard him speak ten words together." 

" Is not your strong opinion uncharitable, to 
say the least of it, at a first hearing ?" asked 
Mr. Priestly. 

'* I '11 die in it, though," persisted the cynic 
tranquilly. 

As soon as the three new guests had touched 
hands, Mr. Stewart sat close by the Secretary, 
quietly looking over, at the request of his friend, 
some sheets of his writing; and Mr. Grady 
and Mr. Pack took chairs at a little distance, 
both evidently wrapt up in the important per- 
son and present pursuits of one of their admit- 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 123 

ted masters ; although the former continued to 
show his respect and interest in a less remark- 
able way than the latter. 

*' Will it do ?" asked the Secretary of Mr. 
Stewart : and having received, in a low, quick 
Scotch tone, what must have been a favourable 
answer, he set down his pen, and continued — 
** then away with it ! — Pack, do touch that 
bell ; — Grady, oblige me by enveloping all this 
paper ; — let 's see," pulling out his watch— 
'* ay — the time nicked to a minute ;" a servant 
appeared, handing a note — " tut, tut," the ho- 
nourable Secretary went on, as he read it, — 
'* copy, copy, copy ; here 'tis for them : pray 
use your own seal, Grady ; there ; does dinner 
wait ?" 

The servant answered that it was served. 

" Then — but no — let me see !" — and his ex- 
pressive eyes might have glanced, under their 
lids, at the admiring faces of Messrs. Grady and 
Pack — the young Caledonian managed things 
better than they — **yes — send some one down 
to Mr. Green's office, and say I wish to see 
him a moment." — The servant disappeared. 

** My friends will excuse me ; I demur as 
much as any one to what may appear the mix-

ing up together of business and dinnering, or 
relaxing of any kind ; but we are compelled to 
some attention to things, for a few weeks, or so. 
— Oh, Green ;"" as the sleek official helper ap- 
peared — " I shall want you to — go down the Me- 
diterranean for me to-morrow ; so you will be 
in readiness/' — Mr. Green bowed and withdrew ; 
and at the intimation which speedily followed, 
all repaired to the dining-room. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 125 



CHAPTER VII. 

From such a group of, with few exceptions, 
English-Irish as Gerald now sat down amongst, 
he anticipated much conversation on Ireland 
and Irish affairs, in reference to English policy ; 
but he had, at least, to wait some time before 
his anticipations were gratified. Perhaps most 
of the company went with him in his mental 
choice of a subject for discussion, but, from 
a certain shyness of the very matter that en- 
grossed them, and even with which they were 
personally concerned, also shared his disincli- 
nation to bring it forward. 

•' I believe," he said to himself, " that 
amongst Irishmen living in England, or 
through England, the last admission comforta- 
ble to make to one another is the admission 
of their Irish derivation. And who can wonder 
if such is indeed the case ?" 

Meantime Gerald was not uninterested with 
the gradual developement of the characters 



126 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

of those around him, given in the turn of 
their opinions on other passing subjects ; nor 
did some of those opinions fail to engage him 
for their own sake. But he sat beside Mr. 
Gunning, who, from the moment he had ad- 
justed his napkin until the dessert appeared, 
never opened his lips, except to partake of 
almost every change and remove of viand that 
came on the table ; not indeed so much after 
the manner of a mere eater, as after that of an 
epicure, and one well skilled in kitchen myste- 
ries : so, from him Gerald hoped nothing : — 
Lord Clangore seemed engrossed by the elo- 
quent and pleasing Mr. Gore (for, notwith- 
standing some first prejudices, Gerald now 
thought him very pleasing) ; and perhaps one 
of the chief topics between them might be 
connected with the official vacancy before allud- 
ed to by that gentleman. 

Mr. Stewart talked quickly, and, owing to 
his habitually low tone and Scottish accent, 
almost unintelligibly, to the Secretary, across 
the Bishop of ■ ; Lord Harmer and Lord 
Horsemantown sat very quietly together ; 
the Bishop interchanged short syllables, still 
across his neighbours, with the interesting Mr. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 127 

Priestly; Mr. Grady and Mr. Pack enter- 
tained each other; and thus again Gerald 
was not only obliged to wait for the possible 
occurrence of the conversation he preferred, 
but his share in conversation of any kind. 

At length, after his second glass of cham- 
pagne, Mr. Gunning said to him — " How 
that young man cackles." 

The allusion was to Mr. Stewart, and, though 
severe, induced a smile, for it did a caricature 
sort of justice, at least, to its subject, 

" Now, that 's all about Scotland, and Scotch 
people," continued Mr. Gunning, who seemed 
getting into just good-humour enough to be 
ill-natured ; " for they never speak a word 
about any thing but each other, unless it may 
be — themselves." 

** I like their nationality," said Gerald. 

" I don't ; I don't like nationality of any 
kind ; least of all, theirs ; what has any body to 
do with it .'' how can it interest any body ?''"' 

" But, as an Englishman, you are yourself 
national." 

" Not a bit : no true Englishman is ; no 
true Englishman cares a fig for England, ex- 
cept so far as it is necessary to him." 



128 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" I hope your true Englishmen are not 
numerous." 

** I know they are : and one of the reasons 
why I prefer you, half-Irish gentlemen, is, that 
you never bore us about Ireland." 

" You are perhaps magnifying our necessity 
into a virtue.'^ 

" 'Tis politeness, at least — ^" 

Gerald bowed, on behalf of his English-Irish 
constituents — " even though you don't intend 
it," added Mr. Gunning. Could the bow have 
first been set down on the table in a tangible 
form, Gerald would now have put it in his 
pocket. 

*' We have few of the impulses of vanity to 
force Ireland upon the notice of our friends," 
he resumed. 

" No, indeed ; and therefore you very proper- 
ly let her alone. An old Spanish courtier who, 
a long time ago, wrote apophthegms, says that 
the unfortunate are always to be cut ; you are 
quite right." 

Before Gerald could perfectly separate the 
sincerity from the sneers of this sentence, Mr. 
Gunning, catching up a phrase that had just 
escaped Mr. Stewart, cried — " A good talker !— 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 129 

And who, may I ask, Mr. Secretary, are you 
so defining ?" 

" Sir Walter," answered the Secretary. 

*' I told you," muttered Gunning, aside, to 
Gerald : then he proceeded aloud ; indeed very 
loud ; " Good talkers ! I don't know a more 
silly cant of this canting day. Mention the 
name of minister, poet, painter, actor, or essay- 
ist, and the question is, not how does he tax 
us, or rhyme, or paint, or act, or twist a simple 
thread of common sense, but ' how does he 
talk ?' that's the important point." 

" But a great name is adorned, at least, by 
the possession of this pleasing quality," said 
Mr. Stewart. 

" Indeed, Sir ;'■■— Gerald thought that the 
cynic was gratified to engage Mr. Stewart upon 
a question, in the discussion of which he could, 
to the utmost verge of language, inconvenience 
that gentleman's nationalty; — " Pardon me, 
it is eclipsed by it. There's Coleridge has lost 
his poetical name altogether, by his fascinations 
in the new mode of egotism. The Count de 
Soligny, in his last letters on England, after 
giving but a cold account of the bard's pub- 
lished works, adds, — ' But I have heard hira 
G 5 



130 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

talk !' thereby grounding his admiration of 
Coleridge's genius on the man's wwpublished, 
talking essays." 

" I was indeed hurt myself to read , this 
morning, in a licentious periodical work, the ac- 
count of Coleridge's egotism, given by a cockney 
essayist," said the Bishop ; — " While 'explaining 
the different notes of the nightingale to his sis- 
ter,' Coleridge's ' chaunt' is, in a strong vein of 
affectation, much lauded." 

** Chaunt ! — Good !" resumed Mr. Gunning ; 
" ay, and Wordsworth's chaunt too ; and this 
is the same essayist who constantly exhibits old 
Northcote as such a talker ; adding not a word 
about his easel. Pray, Secretary, how does 
your courtly Sir Thomas talk ? very smoothly 
I know, and all that ; but how else ?" 
" Very sensibly." 

" He doesn't mean his answer," whispered 
Gunning to Gerald, and then continued : " Dr. 
Morris, during his visit at Abbotsford, thought 
little of the great Northern until he began, 
after dinner, to recite or talk some of his ' auld 
world stories ;' and then such a picture as we 
get of his style of recitation, and of his eyes, 
eyebrows, and all 1" 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 131 

"And the hero of the Shandrydan," said 
Gerald, " in afterwards instituting a comparison 
between * the Great Poet of Scotland, and the 
Great Poet of the lakes,' certainly says not a 
word about their works, but all about their 
* different styles of conversation.' " 

" To be sure : and Wordsworth's * sonorous- 
ness — ' chaunt, I suppose— drawl — I am sure, 
is quite as much admired as Coleridge's since 
has been. Then Hobhouse wrote a large vo- 
lume, partly of memoirs of the Italian rhyme- 
sters ; and there we find ingenuity on the stretch 
to ascertain Ugo Foscolo's method of talking. 
On the authority of * a lady' who enjoyed the 
advantage of Ortis's private society, he seems to 
be a rapid, ceaseless babbler, until we are check- 
ed by the grave historical account of his statue- 
like delivery of certain set speeches in Venice, 
when we are given to understand that he never 
loosed his two hands from the back of a chair, 
nor raised his voice beyond a monotonous rum- 
ble." 

" Who is Ugo Foscolo ?" asked Lord Horse- 
mantown. 

" Ask John Murray," answered the Secretary, 
sneering. 



132 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" And honest John will tell your Lordship 
that he knew him very well," added Gunning ; — 
" and perhaps he can also supply some notion 
of Ugo's diversified manner, when upon certain 
occasions he used, in the fervour of his talking, 
to toss himself about upon a chair or sofa, and 
strew the carpet with his locks of — ^not * sable* 
but brickdust, ' silvered.' 

" The Edinburgh was half right, some time 
ago — " began Mr. Stewart. 

" What ! do you ever think it right ?" in- 
terrupted Mr. Gunning. 

" Apropos to that, or to something like it, — 
I beg pardon a moment — Nixon, pen, ink, and 
paper,'' said the Secretary, of a sudden, — 
" Pray let me stand excused ; but there is one 
little matter I shall have no time but this even- 
ing to- do — just a scribble — and I stop no one, 
not even your discussion, Gunning, for you 
know I can write and talk together," and, as he 
had done speaking, the servant placed the pen, 
ink, and paper to his hand, and the Secretary 
immediately began his new task. 

" I was about to mention," resumed Mr. 
Stewart, " that though we seldom agree, I did 
think the Edinburgh warranted in censuring, 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 133 

as scarcely polite, the very talent for which 
John Philpot Curran's Irish admirers highly 
praise him ; his engrossing habits of conver- 
sation at table, and his setting the table in a 
roar, and all that." 

" No doubt they were right, Sir,'' assented 
Mr. Gunning, in a view of his own ; ** and yet, 
I presume, the Scottish critic would be one of 
the first to bless the man who, in his own house, 
makes his Welsh guest, among others, listen to 
retails or anticipations of poems or novels, sold, 
or to be sold." 

" But poems and novels of which the repeti- 
tion can never tire," said Gerald. 

" In the reading, I grant you ; you will re- 
mark, Sir, that, we do not now speak of their 
extraordinary merit — indeed, not at all of them, 
but merely of their being so talked about." 

" Can't men think .?" observed Lord Horse- 
man town. 

" No, my Lord, because they talk. Talkers ! 
we are grown a nation of talkers. We usurp 
the women's ancient privilege, and they can 
only listen to it ; it is come to that with them. 
We leave it to the North American Indians 
to say * much talk, little do ;' and their Squaws 



134 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

are the only remaining branch of the gentler sex, 
whose taciturn husbands allow to female tongues 
the enjoyment of their prescriptive right." 

" There is an actor," said Mr. Grady, mys- 
teriously, " who for talking Greek, after dinner, 
gets more puflPed by the press than on account 
of his doings behind the lamps." 

" I propose a college of talkers," said the 
Secretary, not stopping his pen, at least ob- 
servably ; " nay, a London University, with 
preparatory schools. I propose an abolition of 
printed poems, and all kind of books, and the 
substitution of talking bodies " 

*' Of the first of which Coleridge shall be 
president," put in Gunning. 

" If you like ; but in them let the cha- 
racters of literary men, at least, be fixed, by 
good talking works, and afterwards dissemi- 
nated, by affiliated institutions, over the world." 

" It might be a good way, Secretary, to save 
ourselves the perplexity of our present mixed 
notion of only doubtful prose or rhyme, and 
good talking. We should then get a whole 
character before us." 

V *' Newton knew nothing about talking," ob- 
served Gerald. 

" He had no need," said Lord Horsemantown. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 135 

" I know of a Newton who does," observed 
the Secretary, in his dry way. 

" The very delightful painter ?" inquired 
Gerald. 

" Mr. Newton the painter," reviewed the Se- 
cretary. 

" And after all," continued Gunning, " even 
when we give one of these gentlemen his most 
wished-for title of ' good talker,' 'tis but a li- 
mited and qualified title. They cannot always, 
nor in every situation, talk well — nay, at all. 
Thus, Coleridge and Wordsworth are supreme 
in metaphysics ; the one in his metaphysics, the 
other after a sermon : give them Cobbett, and 
they stare : yet the turnip-farmer is choice on 
his own plot of ground ; to all intents and 
purposes, a first-rate talker. Ay, or place the 
dreamer of the Ancient Mariner, and the dream- 
er of the Excursion together, and, all to nothing, 
one becomes a listener, or both wax stupid. 
Foscolo told me he knew Coleridge when he 
first came to England ; I believe they lived 
some time in the same house, (at least Ugo said 
so,) but did not continue friends. I remem- 
ber him averring, in a torrent of stunning 
volubility, that the Highgate Hermit talked too 
much.'' 



136 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

*' Moore is a fascinating table or drawing- 
room man," said Gerald ; " but what could he 
do with Wordsworth's *chaunt?' or in his trip- 
ping gait, how keep pace with Coleridge's seven- 
leagued periods ?" 

*' Or what could they do with him ? No- 
thing,'' continued the cynic ; " if he dined or 
supped with either, he should hold his tongue, 
or, at least, be nobody ; and, if they returned 
the favour, they should comply with the terms, 
else were the fable of the fox and the stork read 
at school in vain. And, no doubt, in his old 
feudal towers, and no Coleridge or Wordsworth 
to contest with him, and within hearing of that 
devil of a piper, that he keeps as Byron kept 
his bear at college, and who, at a signal, blows 
you up such a convincing tempest of Highland 
music. Sir Walter was sovereign. Next morning, 
too, he could easily keep all the fascination to 
himself as he ambled through ' the rhymer's 
glen,' which is now his own farm ; and as for 
holding forth, within or without the walls of 
* fair Melrose,' mortal men must not here dis- 
pute his right. But suppose Wordsworth at 
his board , the evening Peter speaks of, or plod- 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 137 

ding, pedlar.like, by his stirrup, next morn- 
ing, the exciseman and he could not keep up, 
five minutes, an equal conversation. They 
could not support, — strike each other out. Even 
let them oblige each other, (in the case of talk- 
ers an impossibility,) by reciting and chanting,al- 
ternately, equal portions of Highland legends and 
village metaphysics ; both would be uninterest- 
ing. Alternation without continuance of sub- 
ject, between two lecturers, no matter how chaunt- 
ing or sonorous, proposes in itself a tiresome si- 
tuation ; but the mere infelt humiliation of a 
* good talker' at being obliged to share his lau- 
rels with a brother, would certainly produce a 
languor in each of these great men, or in any 
other two, or twenty, that must individually de- 
prive them of their undisputed claims to ego- 
tism, when only astonishing such docile listeners 
as Dr. Morris." 

" Very well indeed. Gunning," said the Secre- 
tary ; " here, Stewart, look over that," handing 
a sheet of paper, at the first view of which Mr. 
Stewart smiled in evident satisfaction — *very 
well talked indeed,' — writing again, ' and with- 
out at all outraging in your own person the 



188 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

rules you lay down for others — now, no reply, 
till you criticise a few lines of doggrel for me, 
while Stewart does the same by some others — 
there," pushing over a slip of paper folded 
down — " and now. Bishop, and now Lord 
Harmer, and now Mr. Priestly, what are we 
indeed to say of Gunning's abuse of talkers ?" 

It will not be inferred that, during the time 
he was writing, the honourable Secretary had 
been inattentive to the guests he now addressed, 
or indeed to any others at his table, or that they 
had not occasionally joined in the past conver- 
sation, although for the purpose of getting to- 
gether, in preference, what fell from Mr. Gun- 
ning, he and they seem, according to our report, 
to have been silent, or silenced. 

During the answers and remarks produced by 
his present question. Gunning spoke aside to 
Gerald : 

" The lines are quite good, and quite like 
him — terrible satire, that spares nothing and 
nobody. Read them, before he despatches them 
to Ebonj/." 

" Is it lawful.?" asked Gerald. 

** Yes, yes ;" answered the Secretary himself, 
observing in a side-glance his hesitation ; " they 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 139 

are not worth a mystery," and as he quickly 
turned to continue speaking to the Bishop and 
Lord Harraer, Gerald read the following : — 

" POLITICAL ALPHABET ; OR THE YOUNG 
MEMBER'S ABC. 

" A, was an Althorp, as dull as a hog; 

B, was black Brougham, a surly cur dog ; 

C, was a Cochrane all stripp'd of his lace ; 

D, was a Douglas, who wanted a place ; 

E, was an Ebrington, dismal and dumb; 

F, was a Finley, a hogshead of scum ; 

G, was a Gordon's preposterous phiz ; 
H, was a Heron, a damnable quiz ; 

J, was Joe Jekyl, whose law is a jest ; 

K, was a Knox, in a sinecure nest ; 

L, was a Lambton, sour, saucy and sad; 

M, was Paul Methuen ! a dandy gone mad; 

Nj was big Nugent, who " Portugal" writ ; 

O, was an Ossulton, small as his wit ; 

P, was poor Preston, stark mad about oats ; 

Q, was a Quin, who with neither side votes ; 

R, was dark Romilly's hypocrite look ; 

S, was a Sefton, Lord, coachman, and cook ; 

T, was Tom Thompson, a Tinker from Hool; 

V, was a Vernon, an asphaltic* fool ; 

• One of Mr. V— — 's speeches was laughed at for a 
metaphor about the Asphaltic Lake.

W, was a Wame, 'twixt a wasp and a wonn ; 
But X, Y, and Z, are not found in this fonn. 
Unless Moore, Martin, and Creevy be said 
(As the last of mankind) to be X, Y, and Zed." 

" Terrible, indeed,** whispered Gerald, " even 
upon his enemies.** 

"And yet none of them are his enemies, either, 
or in other words, he feels no more than simple 
constitutional enmity to any of them, except 
two out of the last three; and I should not 
wonder if the whole alphabet was got up merely 
to give a seemingly impartial opportunity for 
emitting the gathered venom expressed on X 
and Zed. 

" But now you conjecture twenty-three per- 
sons flayed alive without a motive.*' 

*' No — I*ve also conjectured the motive." 

** It amounts to no more than convenience.** 

" And is not that enough ?** 

" Well ; admitting your view, why are X 
and Zed to be especially put to death ?" 

" X, once stood in his way, and Zed now 
speaks against him whenever he comes up 
officially to the house." 

" But do you call it prudent thus to satirize 
so many considerable individuals who, one day 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 141 

or other, by some probable topsy-turvy freak 
in the cabinet, may get power, or become the 
supporters of the powerful ?" 
" He doesn't care." 

" How r 

** He would be in with them, and keep his 
place still." 

" How, again ?"" 

*' By supporting them, or all or any thing 
they might support to be sure, and by being 
ready to make out for Blackwood another al- 
phabet of any twenty-four of their opponents." 

" That 's talent, indeed." 

" Yes ; our friend, with all his good qua- 
lities, has a little of the cat in him j he is attached 
to place, not pcisons — but the Unes are very 
clever.'" 

" Very ; only, T still demur to the unsparing 
nature of the satire." 

" 'Tis his style. You have geen the little 
pasquinade he wrote on the actors in Dublin, 
long ago, when he was a Barrister walking the 
hall of your Four Courts there, and when his 
clients, at least, (though from their numbers we 
need not think much of their opinion) scarcely 
dreamt of his present success ?'"' 



142 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

** It has never come in my way." 

" That's unlucky, if you care to be convinced 
of his natural tendency to this kind of satire. 
Witness a quotation from it vpon a woman, 
one of the poor Dublin actresses, and, until his 
criticism, popular among the Dublin people- 
but first to show him in his best vein — 

* Williams comes, the rude and rough. 

With face most whimsically gruff; 
Aping the careless sons of ocean. 
He. scorns each light and easy motion ; 
His elbows to his sides he pins ; 
And dabbles with his hands like fins ; 
Would he express the greatest woe. 
He slaps his breast and points his toe ; 
Is merriment to be expressed ? 
He points his toe and slaps his breast.' " 

" Churchill never excelled that," said Gerald ; 
perhaps seldom equalled it." 

" Now you get him in the humour you are 
inclined not to patronize," said Gunning, and 
went on with his quotations. 

* ''But lo ! his wife, whose every feature 
Foretells the talent of the creature; 
Lively and vulgar, low and pert. 
She plays *au vif the pleasant flirt. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 148 

And hits, without the slightest aid 
From art, the saucy chambermaid; 
Oh might her merits ne'er presume 
To figure in a drawing-room !'' 

I believe I forget the remaining lines until 
he advises her, in accordance with her nature, 

to 

* Decline Bizarre and play Lamoree.' " 

** You get the man's mind there, I think." 

" And his heart too," added Gerald. 

« Pho ! heart ? what's that ?" 

" A mystery to you, I believe, Sir," replied 
Gerald, in his own mind, " as much as to him, 
if indeed your comments are to be taken for 
fact, when at the moment you share his cup, 
you can thus expose your seeming friend to a 
comparative stranger. But," Gerald continued, 
" such ought to be the kind of friendship sub- 
sisting between them ; it would be a pity were 
it of a different description. I suppose even 
the terms of it are mutually understood." 

" I guess," resumed Gunning, proceeding to 
give him certainty on the point, — " I guess 
by your eye that you take my remarks on the 
Secretary as unfriendly towards him ; but you 
mistake; I would serve him and he would serve 



144 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

me, as far as it conveniently lay in the way 
of either, though I show him up now and 
then, and though he knows I do ; he knows I 
am at it this moment : I caught his eye glan- 
cing after his ear while we discussed him ; 
besides he would show me up in the same way 
if you were by his side instead of sitting 
here." 

Gerald rather coldly concurred in the pro- 
bability. " Or he would take the same free- 
dom with yourself, if he knew as much of you 
as I do," half sneered Gunning in revenge for 
the slight change of face and manner his 
practised eye soon detected. " But do you 
surmise my reason for holding forth, just now, 
so vehemently against talkers ?"" 

*' You simply dislike them.** 

" Not always ; I had a more particular 
motive. There is your countryman, Mr. Gore, 
who, whatever may be the subjects he can 
handle, is, I am sure of it, in good estimation 
with himself as a graceful and pleasing talker ; 
and, just before I commenced my sermon, I 
saw his handsome red face waxing redder all 
over, and his mouth curving up, in the preface, 
to a volume of soft speeches. I stopped him 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 145 

by what I said, however, to say nothing of 
the good I did the young Scotchman. Mr. 
Gore all this time has had no hearer but your 
brother — a mercy to every one else. Now, 
though, I fear we shall get him all round, 
if the Secretary does not "pull up in the road 
he has just started on, and if he does not, 
I 'ra off." 

" Like Sir Peter, then, I shall leave my 
character in your hands," said Gerald, once 
more smiling. 

" We '11 take care of the little trust for you ; 
and, after all, I think the Secretary, along with 
all the rest of you that now (we are come to 
a pretty pass) sit in the Cabinet for us, and 
make law for us, and fight the French for us, 
— I hate Frenchmen more than Scotchmen — 
something like a credit to Ireland, or to that 
half, or quarter of it, or whatever portion it is, 
which will have us call it English-Irish." 

" Let us see,** thought Gerald.

CHAPTER VIII. 

" My friend George is one of the best talkers 
I know,'' was the remark of the Secretary that 
produced the turn in the conversation, to which 
Mr. Gunning metaphorically alluded in the last 
chapter : " one of the best, though the most bor- 
ing : he talks sentences always, never phrases ; 
and there are his eulogy and criticism together. 
He is good for a solemn morning call on you, 
when from occupation, just before, you are 
prepared not to tire of his compositions ; but he 
is not good for the evening." 

*' You speak of our countryman ; what is he 
doing ?" asked the Bishop. 

"Why he has been writing a comedy (he 
called it so) for one of the theatres; *The 
Angel of the World' and its publisher having 
fallen together. And he dedicated it by per- 
mission to Canning.'' 

" Has any thing come of the compliment ?" 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 147 

" Yes," answered Gunning ; " a new version 
of the Apocalypse, by which the destruction of 
Popery, root and branch, in a very short time 
indeed, is demonstrated, by the Rev. George 
Croly." 

" That sounds strange, though not unpleas- 
ing. May I ask what you mean, Sir?" in- 
quired the Bishop. 

" Why, Bishop, Canning having forgotten 
the dedication, its writer published some matter 
of the kind I speak of, about the very time 
that his negligent patron made his most celebra- 
ted speech in favour of your great Hibernian 
question." 

" Both might have been better employed," re- 
sumed the Bishop, " and in furtherance of their 
different objects, too : though/ (pausing,) " their 
motives may be essentially the same, after all." 

" Your Lordship, I thought, knew that one of 
these gentlemen is not disposed to agree in ac- 
ceding to those people any increase of political 
power," observed Mr. Priestly. 

" I know it : yet, though two loyal gentlemen 
may widely differ on the question, I suppose, at 
least I strongly hope, they have in view a com- 
mon result, even while they differ." 
H 2 



148 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" I coincide with your Lordship," said Ge- 
rald, 

" I have not yet the honour to apprehend his 
Lordship's meaning," resumed Mr. Priestly. 

" Nor I," said Lord Harmer. 

" Nor I," echoed Mr. Grady, Mr. Gore, and 
Mr. Pack. 

'* I 'm off, as I told you," whispered Gunning 
to Gerald, as the Bishop, smiling a conscious- 
ness of the easy reconciling of his seeming pa- 
radox, was about to proceed : ** all this is going 
to be all about Ireland ; and though, I believe, I 
have myself to blame for giving the word, and 

ough I 'm not quite so tired of Ireland as 

am of Scotland, yet, not being Irish even 
half-way through, I can never stand it ;" and 
rising slowly on his stick, he soon left the room. 

**The loyal gentleman," continued the Bi- 
shop, " who disallows those claims, does so, 
because he thinks that an extension of power 
would strengthen the claimants in influence 
and numbers; and the loyal gentleman who 
advocates those claims, does so, because he 
thinks that the removal of restrictions of 
every kind would leave the claimants, parti- 
cularly in Ireland, more leisure and inclination 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 149 

to attend to the teaching and preaching of a 
pure doctrine, which eventually, in the oppor- 
tunities he would create, must supersede the pre- 
sent superstition : so that, while one refuses the 
boon, lest the petitioners should grow stronger, 
the other cedes it to make them even weaker 
than they are ; and hence their motives are, as I 
said, essentially the same." 

" Now I understand your Lordship," said 
Mr. Priestly. 

" And I have to thank your Lordship for 
stating my views so clearly," said Gerald. 

" We, in Ireland, my Lord," said Mr. Gore, 
" who hold the views first stated so well by 
your Lordship, have, indeed, the same good 
hopes of our loyal fellow-subjects in both 
countries. While they differ from us on the 
important question, we believe they do not 
mean to expose us, more than we are exposed, 
to the insidious encroachments of a religion 
deeply hostile to us ; to our religion and theirs ; 
to our political ascendency ; in fact, to all that 
we are so proud to hold by virtue of our Eng- 
lish descent, principles, and connexion." 

** The supporters of the measures, English or 
Irish, with whom I have spoken," said Lord 



150 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

Clangore, " that is, with whom I could pro- 
perly speak in confidence, certainly have no 
such meaning ; and though I differ from them 
in the principle of their policy, so much justice 
may be done to their intentions." 

" The first point is this^ remarked Mr. 
Grady, composing a leader — *' what is the cause 
of the present unhappy state of Ireland ? why 
is she the only uncivilized portion of the three 
kingdoms ? After more than seven hundred years 
of identity with this country "^ 

*' Not identity, Grady ; that almost makes 
you speak a paradox," said the Secretary. 

« Connexion, Sir ?" 

« No." 

" Then, Sir, conjunction .?" 

*' Not even that, unless you mean our gram- 
matical anomaly, a disjunctive conjunction ; call 
it wrangling and squabbling." 

" I will. Sir ; and that is the very thing I 
would show, and at the same time question ; 
why should it have been to this day wrangling 
and squabbling?" 

" The Irish people have not been taught to 
think," said Lord Horsemantown ; " have not 
had mental objects to engage them, and thereby 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 151 

keep them quiet ; for a man whose mind is em- 
ployed on pursuits that tend to improve it, 
knows and cares Httle about politics, after com- 
ing to one simple conclusion — namely, honour 
and respect for King, Laws, and Government." 

" Scotland, that much later than seven hun- 
dred years ago was the declared and powerful 
enemy of England, is now her feal friend," said 
Mr. Stewart ; " indeed, both are but parts of 
one great kingdom." 

" And still, I ask, why has not Ireland fol- 
lowed her example ?" pursued Mr. Grady : 
" years have gone by, since, through the wis- 
dom of an English minister, and of our great 
countryman at present at the head of affairs, she 
gave up one of the chief, at least one of the 
most obvious landmarks of distinction between 
her and us — her Parliament." 

" Her absurd Parliament — her exquisitely 
Irish Parliament," resumed the Secretary : " it 
was a riotous, popular assembly, not a Parlia- 
ment : men went there to make speeches, not to 
dehberate ; to call each other ' out,' not to con- 
vince each other ; and their wives and daughters 
used to sit in the galleries to hear husband or 
father deliver orations that had been twenty 



152 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

imes read at home, and to encumber with their 
presence every thing like freedom or manliness 
of debate. Burke was a tolerably good speci- 
men to an English House of Commons of the 
elaborate, rhetorical fuss, the unbusiness-like 
declamation, the sputtering and roaring, that, 
even in the persons of its most boasted orators, 
sunk the character of the Irish House of Com- 
mons." 

" Yes, Sir," argued Mr. Grady ; " I have 
spoken with many of the old reporters who vi- 
sited the gallery, here, in his latter days, and 
they assure me he was the greatest bore the 
House ever heard. He used to roar, Sir, as you 
say, walking up and down by the table, like a 
wild beast, until two-thirds of the members went 
away, and the press along with them: I assure you. 
Sir, it came to that ; they wouldn't ' take him.' " 

" I 'm sorry for it, Sir," said Gerald, " for 
however inconvenient might have been the de- 
livery of Mr. Burke's opinions, they read well ; 
and only that the gentlemen you mention might 
have felt too much annoyed, I should regret the 
loss of any of his speeches." 

*' Returning to Mr. Grady's queries," conti- 
nued the Secretary, *' suppose we say that the 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 153 

undeniable inclination of the old Celtic blood of 
old Ireland to kicking up a row, may account 
for even the present want of civilization and 
happiness in that country, which he so truly 
recognizes ? It is said, generally, of the Celts 
and Normans, that while the one race always 
weakened, and kept themselves ignorant and 
savage, by domestic quarrellings, the other race, 
united in arms, in arts, in interests, and in di- 
versified improvement, every where found them 
an easy conquest. But the mere conquering 
them could not change the grand passion of 
their nature, or their old habits. Thus, 
though universally deprived of their inde- 
pendence, they still kept up the old game ; 
still squabbled upon the most trivial occa- 
sion, or upon no occasion, with their masters, 
or with one another ; still left themselves no 
time for the mental pursuits, scientific or other- 
wise, so well suggested as a nostrum for 
them by my excellent friend, Lord Horseman- 
town ; until, to this very day, we find them what 
they have ever been in Ireland — and what 
they are." 

" For whatever good conduct, industry, mora- 
lity, intellect, or rank, we possess in Ireland, we 
H 5 



154 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

are assuredly indebted to this great country," 
said Mr. Gore. 

" Absentee landlords, they aver, make one 
chief cause of their wretchedness and turbu- 
lence," remarked Mr. Stewart, as usual speaking 
very rapidly in his throat : " but that 's stufiF ; 
no man who considers the subject, scientifically, 
can entertain it for a moment. I don't say that 
resident landlords are an absolute evil to any 
country; but I do say, that in the present ano- 
malous position of Ireland, the absence of her 
landlords might, if properly taken advantage of, 
prove a good, instead of a curse ; indeed it is 
idle to debate the matter ; it has been proved 

by M'CuUoch." 

" Some say that Sir Walter Raleigh is to be 

blamed in a great degree for the evils of Ireland 

since about the time of Elizabeth," resumed the 

Secretary. 

" How so?" asked Lord Horsemantown, 

rather interested. 

" Because they assert that the potatoe is the 

root from which its evils spring," he went on, 

in a sneer that Lord Horsemantown did not see. 
" Come,"" said the Bishop, " I have listened 

to many opinions, as to the cause of those evils ; 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 155 

but surely no man of ordinary observation, 
living in Ireland, can mistake the true one^ — her 
teachers." 

" Her teachers, indeed !" echoed Lord Har- 
mer, turning from a quiet tete-a-tete with Lord 
Clangore. 

" The bane of the wretched land," agreed 
Mr. Priestly, with an earnestness that indicated 
long and settled conviction, and of which he had 
shown few other instances during the evening. 

" Perhaps, in a more general phrase, we should 
say the superstition she bows to," continued the 
Bishop ; " only, that at the hands of these men it 
is ministered in every form most calculated to 
besot the human intellect, deprive its blind vota- 
ries of all self-estimation, perpetuate mere animal 
passions, and generate all the impulses to re- 
venge, treachery, and bloodshed, of which day 
after day we are doomed to witness the results 
Dangerous as is the mere profession of Popery 
in its best shape, I do not think it could work 
as it does work in Ireland but for the mode in 
which it is put forward by her priests; and 
therefore I particularly select them, when I 
would advance, in a word, the cause of the pre- 
sent state of that wretched Island." 



156 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" Then, my Lord, having the real cause be- 
fore us, let it be removed,'' said Mr. Priestly. 

" You can't remove Mem," answered the 
Secretary. 

" Remove the poor people from them," said 
the Bishop. 

" And go to the work boldly," resumed Mr. 
Priestly. " With good intentions on this sub- 
ject, we have as yet only stopped short at half 
measures, disguising our motives in school 
education, and when charged with a wish to 
insinuate (rather than inculcate) the truth, equi- 
vocating like cowards, as if we feared either 
that our cause would not bear the light, or that 
we shrunk from a contest with its enemies. Let 
us march into the field more like courageous 
soldiers ; let us say to the people of Ireland, 
in plain language, ' We wish to change your 
religious belief, because we know it keeps you 
poor, ignorant, miserable, and most of all, be- 
cause it is a blasphemy ;' and let us at the same 
time say to their priests, * You hear our purpose 
proclaimed, meet us in the field, and oppose us 
and conquer us if you can. Show these, your 
most unhappy flock, good reasons for the faith 
that is in them, if indeed you have imparted 



THE ANGLO-IRISH 157 

one clear notion^ however erroneous, upon the 
doctrine of salvation ; refute the reasons we 
give for a better faith ; do this, and we will leave 
in your hands the minds, the morals, the hap- 
piness, here and to come, of the land." 

" Thus should we proceed, indeed,*' said 
Lord Harmer. 

*' I would approve such a course," said Lord 
Horseraantown, seemingly becoming possessed 
of a new and pleasing idea. 

" I know Ireland well," said Mr, Gore, " and 
will go so far as to declare, that, in my opinion, 
it requires but a few years' perseverance in the 
plan proposed, to rescue the great majority of 
the Irish people from their present thraldom." 

" Ten years only," agreed the Bishop. 

" There is nothing in the good work but the 
trouble of teaching," resumed Mr. Priestly. 
" "We are not, generally speaking, faced with 
the difficulty of pulling down an old edifice in 
order to erect a new one ; for, in truth and fact, 
the people know nothing at all of religion of 
any kind." 

" To what, then, do they give the name ?" in- 
quired Gerald : " what are they taught by their 
]mests ?" 



158 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" Mummeries, Sir," answered Mr. Priestly. 

" Forms that are mummeries," added the 
Bishop : " they are taught to go to mass^ of 
which they do not understand a word ; to use 
holy-water ; to mumble prayers to the Virgin, 
as they tell their beads ; to wear charms against 
sickness, sorrow, and fairy blasts ; to kneel down 
before rude pictures and images ; to think that 
the priest's wrath can warp their limbs, blight 
their crops, and destroy their cattle : these are 
the chief if not the only matters of a spiritual 
kind with which the poor Irishman is made ac- 
quainted ; and, as my worthy friend observes, 
none of them contain any prepossessions against 
the real doctrines of religion." 

" Could Scotland have been what she now 
is, if her mind and energies had been kept 
down by superstition like this .?" inquired Mr. 
Stewart. 

" Certainly not," said Gerald ; " but, my 
Lord, the priests of Ireland must, along with 
their other dangerous qualities, be as ignorant 
as their poor flock, to inculcate such supersti- 
tion r 

" The greater part of them is ; that is, almost 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 169 

all those who, coming into orders from the 
plough or the mechanics' workshop, have late- 
ly been educated at home ; they with as much 
new acquirement as enables them to read their 
breviary and mass-book, they may be class- 
ed in the intellectual scale, and even in scrip- 
ture knowledge, with their old brethren of the 
clod, whom they are sent back from some local 
seminary to teach : sometimes you find them ti- 
morous, clumsy, poor men, bold in nothing but 
disguised bigotry ; sometimes you can scarcely 
distinguish them from the hardy, bluff clown 
out of orders, or at best from the strong-bodied 
farmer's son who goes out to hunt, now and 
then, on a strong-bodied horse ; and their best 
specimen is to be seen in the town curate, or 
parish priest, who, wearing a better coat and 
professional boots, can wrangle over his tumbler 
of punch, about some abstruse, superfluous and 
(by him) but half conceived metaphysical de- 
finition of the attributes of Divine Essence. 
From none of them should we expect clear or 
serious views of what they ought to teach their 
people ; but such are the majority of the priests 
who, along with hatred to England, and every 



160 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

thing English, in either country, do teach their 
people the childish superstitions I have enume- 
rated." 

" I should like to hear your Lordship's ac- 
count of the minority ; of those, I presume, 
who have not been educated at home ?" 

" The few among the present body of Irish 
priests," continued the Bishop,"who have studied 
at Salamanca or at St. Omers, enjoy, of course, 
a more liberal round of acquirement than their 
indigenous successors ever pretend to ; they 
also have, perhaps. Scriptural learning, and 
(witness O'Leary) are generally adroit dispu- 
tants: but they are never found among the 
country people, in country parishes; and if 
they occasionally convey to their town flocks an 
arbitrary interpretation of a Scripture text, the 
great mass of the people catch no sound of it ; 
while the cold and profitless observations of 
those poor creatures are, by their most enlight- 
ened guides, never prohibited. They enjoin 
them, then, since they tolerate them. And are 
these educated priests, themselves, believers 
in the superstitions they enjoin ? I think not : 
their state of intellect seems to make the ques- 
tion unnatural. If they are not, what is to be 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. I6l 

said of their countenancing, with a view to their 
own pecuniary profit and priestly influence, 
abominations that they know to be insulting to 
God, and death to the soul of his creature ? 
Here we have Jesuitism, calculating, evading, 
cruel Jesuitism, doing, in their persons, the 
work of almost brute ignorance in the persons 
of their locally-educated brethren. As for hos- 
tility to all that makes the happiness and glory 
of England, and, through connexion with her, 
which ought to make the happiness and glory 
of Ireland, if home-instruction gives that^ in 
abundance, to the young priesthood, we have 
little difficulty in determining to what extent 
it must have been imbibed, in continental col- 
leges, by the old." 

" Only that I have resolved," said Gerald, 
" never, in the present condition of Ireland, to 
pay her a visit, I should certainly like to fall 
in with an Irish priest." 

" You can do so without your alternative," 
said Lord Clangore, " and this very evening, 
too : you know we look in at the Spanish Am- 
bassador's, and I have been advised, by our hos- 
tess elect, that, amongst other motives, she gives 
her party to-night, in order to get subscriptions, 



162 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

to be solicited by herself, or at least by his ap- 
pearance before us, for a very poor young Irish 
priest, though one of the smart, town ones first 
described by his Lordship, towards repairing 
the miserable chapel he has been sent to pre- 
side over, here, in one of our London Irish 
colonies.*' 

" I attend her Ladyship then." 

'* But why not visit us ?" inquired Mr. Gore, 
very insinuatingly, and with a personal compli- 
ment meant. 

" Never, Sir," replied Gerald, " until Ire- 
land, by more closely resembling England, be- 
comes more my country ; never until from that 
resemblance I can calculate her happiness and 
respectability, and feel pride in owning myself 
half her son. But until then, England is my 
country ; Ireland cannot now be called so : she 
presents, in religion, in mind, in manner — I 
mean" — (checking himself, and bowing, as he 
saw Mr. Gore grow disturbed,) — " I mean, of 
course, with reference to the mass of her purely 
Irish population — nothing in common with me, 
or with what I admire, respect, and hope to 
attain. No ; she is not my country ; nor yours, 



THB ANGLO-IRISH. 163 

Sir ; nor, my Lord, yours ; nor the country of 
any one of us.'' 

*' Ah, my excellent young friend," said Mr. 
Gore, with a sigh, " how well do we, who live 
in her bosom, surrounded by all that is hostile 
or strange to us, — how well do we feel the truth 
of your remark, and how willingly, how eagerly 
would I adopt your plan of avoidance, if most 
dear, and (allow a father's egotism) most amia- 
ble, deserving, and, alas, without me, helpless 
objects of domestic solicitude, did not command, 
absolutely command, my residence in the unfor- 
tunate country. But pray, my dear Mr. Blount, 
do not deprive us of all hope of the pleasure of 
seeing you. Even in Ireland, few in number as 
we may be, compared with the native popula- 
tion, we compose, beyond doubt, a highly re 
spectable and enlightened community : standing 
by each other, our circles are select, and, quite 
as far as the resemblance can ever approach, 
would remind you of the superior country. I 
have the honour of knowing many, many distin - 
guished friends who would make you at home ; 
and, I trust, I need not add, that amongst the 
immediate members of my own family, you 



164 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

would experience nothing inattentive — or, from 
three young ladies, not reckoned either unac- 
complished or unattractive, (excuse the father 
again. Sir,) nothing disagreeable." 

" The three most beautiful creatures in Dub- 
lin, Sir," whispered Mr. Grady, " particularly 
the youngest." 

" Well, Sir," answered Gerald, returning, 
without affectation, some of the soft smiles Avith 
which Mr. Gore regarded him, and perhaps not 
before he had involuntarily conjured up (Ge- 
rald was only one-and-twenty) the pretty pic- 
ture of a young gentleman, just like himself, 
domesticated among " the three most beautiful 
creatures in Dublin," and sung to, and talked 
to, all day long — " Well, Sir, whenever I do 
visit Ireland (and perhaps your partial vindica- 
tion of it has removed some of my prejudices), 
I shall not forget the kindness and politeness 
with which you are now pleased to express 
yourself." 

" ]My dear Sir !" was Mr. Gore's answer, as, 
half rising, he took Gerald's hand across the 
table. In fact, Mr. Gore liked the Secretary's 
claret, and by this time he had evinced his liking. 

" No rash promises, Blount," said the Secre- 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 165 

tary, at this bit of a scene, though he had not 
heard the conversation ; *' See the lady first." 

Mr. Gore laughed heartily. 

" She must not be mere Irish," observed the 
Bishop, also smiling. 

" No, my Lord ; I disclaim every thing or 
every body that is not English-Irish, at least ; 
and till Ireland is so, I am forced to disclaim her." 

*' Poor Ireland !" said the Secretary, strange- 
ly reminding Gerald of a former sneer of little 
Rhoda Knightly. 

" Ireland must be made so, or remain for 
another thousand years contemned by the world, 
Mr. Blount," continued the Bishop. 

" First, then, make her English in Religion," 
said Mr. Priestly. 

« Yes, that first of all." 

" First of allj" agreed Lord Harmer. 

" How .?" inquired the Secretary. 

" Preach to her openly," said Mr. Priestly. 

<* The landed interest will support you. Sir," 
said Lord Harmer. 

" They will, and they ought," added Lords 
Horsemantown and Clangore. 

" Write down Popery ; get the press on the 
right side," exhorted Mr. Grady. 



166 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" Write it down in every way," said Mr. 
Pack, uttering almost the first loud sentence he 
had that night ventured, and now looking sur- 
prised, if not agitated, at the sound of his own 
voice ; " write it down in tracts and magazines, 
as well as in the daily and weekly papers ; and 
don't you think, Sir, that even works of imagi- 
nation, that little tales, embodying with the 
doctrines sought to be inculcated their fine 
local superstitions and legends, might, if distri- 
buted among the peasantry, have a good effect ?" 

" I quite agree with Mr. Pack," answered 
the Secretary, seriously nodding his head twice 
or thrice, as his deep grey eyes fastened on the 
speaker. 

" Lock up their mass-houses if you can," ad- 
vised Mr. Gore ; " when they were locked up 
before, we had more peace and influence in the 
country." 

" Too late for that. Sir," remarked Gerald; 
" but I agree that a change of religion is indis- 
pensable." 

" Then begin we, in the name of all that can 
prompt us, or give us success," resumed Mr. 
Priestly : " with the promise of support from 
such quarters as now promise it, I, though not 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 167 

professionally called to the task, have no fears in 
personally undertaking it. If the poor people 
we shall convince be shielded by the high and 
wealthy, from the vengeance, or worse, from the 
consequences of the neglect they must expect at 
the hands of their old friends, and if, perhaps, 
even a little assurance of protection accompany 

or precede the first inculcation of doctrine "" 

" It shall," interrupted Lord Harmer. 
" Then to the battle let us go," said Mr. 
Priestly. 

*' Yes ; but provide — make — other opportuni- 
ties for success," said Gerald ; " make, in fact, 
the one so eloquently propounded by his Lord- 
ship awhile ago ; emancipate them first, that 
their angry passions being laid asleep, and the 
great rallying point of their demagogues re- 
moved, they may have leisure to listen to you, 
and you a natural reason for convincing them." 
" We would emancipate them," replied Mr. 
Priestly, " fully, gloriously emancipate them ; 
but, I believe, rejecting the means you pro- 
pose." 

" Indeed," cried Gerald, surprised, for he 
thought the gentleman had before tacitly agreed 
in his policy ; " and, indeed, my Lord," he re-

peated, when, to his continued surprise, the 
Bishop added ; " no — the wilfully blind and ob- 
stinate bigot, who, out of the chimera of his su- 
perstition, shapes hostility to us, and to all con- 
nected with us, him we can never admit to po- 
litical power."" 

" Who drinks coffee ?" asked the Secretary, 
as the servant appeared. 

All arose. 

** I am not convinced, however," ruminated 
Gerald, though the Bishop's firmness had stunned 
him. 

** What think you, Sir ?" he resumed, as he 
and Mr. Stewart met in their progress to the 
drawing-room. 

" In fact, Sir," answered Mr. Stewart, his 
utterance, whether naturally or affectedly, in- 
creasing in quickness, until, indeed, as Mr. 
Gunning had remarked, he seemed to cackle; and 
at the same time he held himself very straight, 
and kept chucking his head very high ; " in 
fact. Sir, make your people a moral, industrious, 
calculating people. I don't pretend to know 
how it is to be done, Sir ; since Popery is in the 
way, I should certainly get rid of it, by all pos- 
sible means ; but I don't pretend to know Ire- 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 169 

land much farther; only just make her people 
a moral, and an industrious, and a calculating 
people, Sir." 

" Coxcomb!'* muttered Gerald, turning away. 
— " Mr. Secretary, pray favour me with your 
real opinion of all that has been said this even- 
ing." 

" All stuff and nonsense," answered the Se- 
cretary, in a close, confidential, and abrupt 
whisper; — " What do you think.? By virtue of 
certain old black-letter enactments, these Catho- 
lics are, this moment, eligible to political power, 
without ceasing to be Catholics : but such is the 
legal ignorance on both sides, that neither Ca- 
tholic nor Protestant sees or admits the fact. 
Come — a cup of coffee." 

In about an hour afterwards Gerald was 
making his bow to the lady of the Spanish Am- 
bassador. Her Ladyship's rooms were full, 
mostly of foreigners ; but the fashionable crowd 
numbered amongst it many English persons of 
both sexes, of rank and title, official as well as 
patrimonial, and Catholic as well as Protestant. 
With a little pressing, if not ostentatious zeal, 
she availed herself of every polite opportunity 
to get subscriptions ^^pour le pauvrejeune pritre

Irlandois^'' and was not long in addressing her- 
self to Gerald. He liberally subscribed her 
list, and inquired after the reverend mendicant. 
The lady led him into a back drawing-room, 
and introduced him at once to " Monsieur PAbbe 
GCBurnr 

Mr. O'Burn sat on a small sofa in almost de- 
voted attention to the discourse of another Ro- 
man Catholic clergyman, an old French priest, 
of a venerable, imposing air, and possessing the 
suavity of the ancien regime. And this was a 
bad situation for Mr. O'Burn. His vulgar, 
(yet not vulgar-featured) face, his uneasy figure, 
his restless hands and legs, his ill-worn new 
clothes, every thing about him contrasted with 
the staid, complacent, self-possession of his com- 
panion. On being introduced, he started up, 
bowed six times very strangely, mumbled, laid 
one hand on a corner of the sofa, and between 
the finger and thumb of the other kept coiling 
the comer of the lapel of his coat. Nothing 
could well be more certain than that he felt 
himself painfully out of place in that house on 
that awful night. Indeed his fidgets made him 
pale ; and his legs seemed ashamed of their new 
acquaintances, the black silk stockings, they 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 171 

did so shift, and shy, and behave themselves in 
such a manner. 

As soon as some quiet was restored, and 
Gerald had taken a place at his side, they began 
to speak about Ireland. But this Gerald did 
not exactly want, so much as what it would 
lead to. Collegiate pursuits in Ireland turned 
up. The man proved to be really uneducated, 
although, with poor smiles that petitioned for 
indulgence and good opinion, he quoted Latin 
every second sentence. Polite literature was 
glanced at ; he was dumb. Some slight ge- 
neral views of the country were taken ; he 
was an ass. 

Gerald prepared to leave him, when, with' 
many curious circumbendibusses, what shall we 
suppose the poor young man proposed ? An 
invitation " to eat a leg of mutton with him 
next Sunday." Gerald, wishing he could swoon, 
politely (and, in pity, his politeness was more 
kindly than stiff,) pleaded a prior engagement. 
" Well, Sir, but the next;" another engagement. 
" Well, then, but sure the next ;" another ; " the 
next" was called up from the womb of time ; 
and, in short, to save Mr. O'Bum the trouble 
of going through what remained of the year's

calendar, Gerald at last seemed to assent. In 
a few days he sent, of course, a formal though 
still not unkind apology ; a quick answer came, 
that, with all its offences against common usage 
and common sense, only proved that the writer 
had not understood the politeness with which 
he was treated. It breathed very Irish wrath, 
suppressed into the utmost possible Christian 
charity, and a sickly sense of having been ill 
treated, mixed up with a bad effort at eccle- 
siastical grandeur, which was exceedingly risi- 
ble. " I must have stood very low in your 
opinion. Sir, when — you absolutely refuse to dine 
with me," it said ; " but believe me, Sir, you 
are not warranted by any previous conduct of 
mine in — violating every rule of good-breeding 
towards me. But I forgive you, dear Sir ; 
for although my family motto is," (here follow- 
ed some Latin Gerald could not make out,) 
" I assure you I don't keep ill will to any one 
in my mind many minutes. However, a respect 
I have for myself as a clergyman and as a 
gentleman, obliges me to say (liowever reluc- 
tantly) that you never again shall be annoyed 
by an invitation from me. However, God 
bless you, my dear Sir, and although I don't 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 173 

mean to see you again, I hope time will change 
the opinions you too hastily formed of 

Your humble servant." 

" Why, yes," said Gerald, holding the curi- 
ous epistle in his hand, " if, under all his 
boorish blundering about his *leg of mutton,' 
and under all his mental and social deficiencies, 
this poor fellow really hides a bigot's heart ; 
and if, indeed, he be a proper specimen of his 
fellow-labourers in the Irish vineyard — misera- 
ble — most miserable is your religious lot, O 
peasantry of Ireland !" 

Upon which point, as well as upon others, 
discussed in this chapter, Gerald was fated to 
receive more authentic information, within the 
limits of the Irish vineyard itself 



174 THE ANGLO IRISH. 



CHAPTER. IX. 

After breakfast next morning, Mr. Grore 
called upon Gerald's brother, and they went 
but to canvass for the appointment, in pursuit 
of which that gentleman had come to England. 

Gerald repaired to the house of the Minister. 
His reception proved flattering, if not kindly. 
Perhaps, had it not been felt that he had busi- 
ness in hand, his guardian would have shown 
less of the watchful dignity of manner which, 
in all official situations, trifling as well as im- 
portant, characterised him. 

Gerald returned thanks for the offer of ap- 
pointment made through Lord Clangore- The 
Minister felt assured that Gerald's talents and 
principles entitled him to expect attention from 
his friends, and that nothing but a knowledge 
of a httle of the theory and habits of busi- 
ness — a knowledge gradually acquirable — was 
wanting on his part to ensure satisfaction to 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 175 

his well-wishers, and success and honour to 
himself. Gerald bowed, and ventured to say 
that if by method and care such knowledge 
were to be had, he would not despair of soon 
possessing it. The Minister was still assured. 
A short pause occurred ; and then he was 
asked, when he thought of going into the 
House ? 

** A seat in the House is the nearest object 
of my ambition," replied Gerald : " and per- 
haps I may add, to your Lordship, that, as soon 
as I hold it, the great Irish question may 
be considered as having gained an additional 
friend." 

" All very well," the Minister said. 

" And, if I do not speak superfluously, my 
Lord, I should wish to mention two grounds 
upon which my opinions are formed." 

" By all means go on, Mr. Blount." 

** First, it appears to me, after some consi- 
deration, that the pressure hitherto used to 
keep down the religion of Ireland, to this day 
ensures it vigour and compactness; and I would 
remove the pressure, in order to approach it in 
a less resisting state, with a view towards its 
suppression by other means.** 



176 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

** Sound policy, generally speaking,*' assented 
the Minister. 

" Next, my Lord, I must own that I would 
emancipate the Roman Catholics of Ireland, in 
redemption, if for no other reason, of a pledge 
lately given them, as I think on the question ?" 

" A pledge, Mr. Blount ?" 

" During the negotiation of the National 
Union between the two countries, my impres- 
sion is, that, to secure their acquiescence in the 
measure, the English Government did pledge 
itself to grant full relief to the Irish Catholics." 

" We were, I believe, scarcely aware of the 
fact," said the Minister. 

" The words of the Act of Union declare, 
' That every one of the Lords and Commons of 
the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and 
every member of the United Kingdom, in the 
first and every succeeding Parliament, shall, 
until the Parliament of the United Kingdom 
otherwise provide^ take the oaths now provided 
to be taken." 

** Those are the words, indeed, Mr. Blount." 

" And it seems to me, my Lord, that they at 

least imply " Gerald paused, vexed at his 

own interpretation. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 177 

** Words may seem to imply many meanings," 
remarked the Minister, smiling. 

" To mean," rallied Gerald, " that after the 
Union, a change in ' the oaths to be taken,' by 
which change Roman Catholics might sit in 
Parliament, was then intended, or professed to 
be intended." 

" The clause may probably bear your con- 
struction, in part." 

" In proposing these Articles of Union to the 
House of Commons," continued Gerald, " Mr. 
Pitt said that, ' in the present state of things, 
and while Ireland remains a separate kingdom, 
no man can say that full concessions can be 
made to the Catholics.' And here I find the 
inference, my Lord, that, as soon as Ireland 
should become united to England, the full con- 
cessions could be made." 

" You might add," still smiled the Minister, 
" and as soon as ' the (then) present state of 
things should have changed;' for the sentence 
you quote contains the double proviso. Both 
events are said to be indispensable to the grant- 
ing ' full concessions.' " 

" The expression, ' present state of things,' 
struck me, my Lord, as only alluding to the 
i5 



178 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

then state of Ireland, considered as ' a separate 
kingdom.'"' 

" Others may read the sentence differently, 
Mr. Blount ; and suppose that Mr. Pitt alluded 
to ' a state of things' distinct from the question 
of Irish Union, which, as I before said, it was 
as necessary to see materially altered, before 
emancipation could be granted, as it was neces- 
sary to see Ireland united to England, before 
the same measure could be entertained." 

" My Lord, Mr. Pitt and his leading friends, 
as he writes himself to Lord Comwallis, 
finding, after the Union, insurmountable ob- 
stacles to the bringing forward measures of con- 
cession to the Catholic body, whilst in office, 
felt it impossible to continue in administra- 
tion under the inability to propose it with the 
circumstances necessary for carrying the measure 
with afi^ its advantages; and he and they 
tendered, for that reason, their memorable re- 
signation." 

" True, they did so," assented the Minister, 

" And presumptive proof appears here, my 
Lord, that he and they believed they had given 
the pledge I speak of." 



THE ANGLO-IRISI# 179 

" It was not thought, Mr. Blount, at least so 
far as we can ascertain, that a pledge of any 
kind was given." 

" Then, my Lord, hopes were held out.'' 

** Many are of your opinion." 

" Hopes," continued Gerald, spiritedly, *' by 
which the Irish people were deceived." 

'* Their own hopes may have deceived them." 

*' But may we not also say, my Lord, that 
they were deceived into those hopes ?" 

" No, no, Mr. Blount," again smiling kindly ; 
" we may not say so." 

" Well then, my Lord," and Gerald re- 
sponded the good humour of the Minister's 
handsome features ; " only this ; they were al- 
lowed to deceive themselves." 

" Perhaps that comes nearer to it." 

Gerald having previously risen, the Mi- 
nister now touched his hand, and bowed him 
out. 

** Yes," he soliloquized, as he walked down 
Pail-Mall, " I suppose, after all, such is the 
real state of the case. I wish, for their own 
sakes, as well as for facilitating the regeneration 
I propose in their favour, that my half-country- 



180 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

men would get rid, in a degree, of their 
habit of taking for granted every thing they 
hope may come to pass. Notwithstanding his 
coxcombry, Mr. Stewart meant them no harm 
last night, when he commanded me to make 
them *■ a calculating people.* Does their sim- 
plicity arise from ingenuous feelings, or from 
careless and rash habits of thinking? — from a 
freshness of heart that cannot conceive of others 
the simulation (old Bacon's lauded word) it is 
itself unconscious of, or from unformed cha- 
racter, and that ardour to obtain, which is a 
feature of mental indolence .? At all events, 
they don't seem to know the world."" 

" My dear friend ! my dear Mr. Blount ! 
my dear Gerald !" exclaimed Mr. Gore, coming 
up behind, and breaking through his reverie, as 
thus, by a handsome climax, he gained the top 
of perfect familiarity ; " A thousand thanks to 
your excellent brother! and, on his account, a 
thousand thanks to you, too ! wish me joy ! — 
My little affair is already settled, through Lord 
Clangore's friendship, and that of the Secretary, 
and now I have only to wish my London friends 
health and happiness, and return at once to my 
dear, dear home !" 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 181 

" I congratulate you, Mr. Gore, and am glad 
my brother could be useful to you." 

" Ah, my excellent young friend, I know 
how you feel ; I know the hearts of all your 
amiable family." They had now joined arms, 
and were walking on together: — ** Yes; this 
very day I must leave you, every thing re- 
quires it; business, prudence, the feelings of 
a fond father ; every thing ; — but, good God !" 
He stopped suddenly, and laid his hand on his 
breast, as if to check some disagreeable or pain- 
ful oppression of the blood, perhaps. 

" Are you ill ?" asked Gerald, in something 
of the dismay depicted on the face of his friend. 

*' No, thank you, no — not absolutely ill ; no 
physical sensations — I beg your pardon ; come 
on," with a heavy sigh. 

" But may I ask the cause of your agita- 
tion ?" 

" No matter ; I scarce wish to trouble you 
by mentioning it, and, only that I know your 
heart, I would not ; but, in fact, called on, as I 
am, by the united voices of duty and affection, 
to leave London to-day, I forgot, in the height 
of my spirits at the thought, that, owing to my 
hurried departure from Ireland, and not having 



182 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

calculated certain claims connected with my 
appointment, and just made upon me, I do not 
stand prepared to — in a word, I cannot possi- 
bly stir till I receive an answer to a letter I 
must write home this very instant." 

Understanding this, though he only inter- 
preted it literally, Gerald had before obliged 
his English-Irish countrymen, and with the 
best heart in the world (Mr. Gore said he 
knew it was,) he therefore hesitated. While at 
Cambridge, expected remittances used some- 
times to take along time in coming from Ireland 
to certain of his friends there, and Gerald, 
more than once appealed to, seldom refused to 
make up for their delay. But after their arri- 
val at Cambridge, at least after the day when, 
making every possible allowance, they ought to 
have arrived, he was surprised that, in the pro- 
portion in which he had anticipated them, they 
took a still longer time in coming to him. In 
fact, he was obliged, on one occasion, to tres- 
pass on his brother, (a thing, no matter how 
sincerely they esteemed each other, he felt dis- 
tressed at doing,) when at last convinced that 
they would not come to him at all. And as no 
Englishman or Scotchman of his acquaintance 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 183 

ever appeared thus skilled in spending more 
than they could aiFord, and forgetting to re- 
fund the borrowed surplus, or, as it might be, 
were ever compelled to trouble their friends 
in consequence of having been boldly sent out 
into the world without having the means of 
meeting its claims, Gerald concluded the prac- 
tice was purely Irish ; and for all these reasons, 
as I have said, he now hesitated, though only 
one-and-lwenty, to reply at once to Mr. Gore's 
statement. 

" But do not let me annoy you with my 
private affairs," continued Mr. Gore : " I shall 
only trouble you for house-room to scribble my 
letter. Lord Clangore's house being at hand, 
and my hotel so far off; without particular 
connexions in London, I must submit to my 
fate as I can, for a week at least ; though," 
heaving another sigh, "heaven only knows 
what may happen at home, in the meantime !" 

Gerald's hesitation vanished. Mr. Gore seem- 
ed to hint that some inconvenience, no matter 
what, might possibly arise, by his absence, to 
" the three most beautiful creatures in Dublin,*' 
and he was conquered at a blow. 

" My dear Sir," he said, " you must not, in 



184 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

this case, at least, regret the want of close con- 
nexions in London, if, indeed, you can allow 
me to have the pleasure of obhging you." 

" Excellent friend ! dear Mr. Blount !" as 
he seized Gerald's hand, " I did not dream of 
making such a request ; but, since you have so 
kindly expressed yourself, I — but again, I fear 
the amount of the necessary sum puts it out of 
the question ; for 1 am called on, since my ap- 
pointment, to expend, one way or other, and on 
account of the appointment alone, about three 
hundred and fifty pounds." 

It was, indeed, a sum much more considera- 
ble than Gerald had contemplated ; but he 
could not well draw back. He only ventured 
to inquire if three hundred and fifty pounds 
would quite enable Mr. Gore to undertake, 
without delay, his journey to Ireland ? 

" Quite : of course all my travelling expendi- 
ture has been calculated ; this unexpected de- 
mand could alone cause any inconvenience." 

Gerald stepped into a shop, and wrote a 
draft on his banker for the sum. 

" Thanks, my dear young friend ! — and be 
assured, that my punctuality in a remittance" — 
(Gerald winced at the word) — " shall be the first 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 185 

proof of my lively recollection of your kind- 
ness. God Almighty bless you, — farewell f" 

I shall not decidedly state, from my authen- 
tic sources of information, whether or not " the 
appointment"" really, and exclusively, made 
this sudden claim on the worthy Mr. Gore; 
whether or not part, at least, of Gerald's three 
hundred and fifty pounds contributed, in va- 
rious little ways, to a subsequent display, in 
Dublin, which, with his fascinating lady, and 
the three " most beautiful creatures," the spend- 
thrift and needy Irish gentleman would, for 
reasons of his own, have almost " coined his 
heart"" to keep up ; — it is sufficient for the pre- 
sent — (we may meet Mr. Gore again) — to inform 
my reader that — (how Gerald honoured, as his 
sole comfort, his first misgivings!) — the promised 
remittance, which was " to give the first proof," 
&c. took as long a time in travelling from the 
Pigeon-house to Holyhead, as any of its visio- 
nary predecessors, before alluded to, had done. I 
will be generous, and anticipate a little more. 
It never " came to hand." 

Gerald took his seat in the House. The night 
for the discussion of the Catholic Claims drew 
on, and he prepared the heads of his maiden 



186 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

speech. Upon the last division on the question, 
it had passed the Commons with a majority ; 
a small one, indeed, but still a majority ; and 
now he anticipated some increase of numbers. 
However, while the opponents of the measure 
did not relax in their ardour and unanimity, 
there was a difference of opinion among the 
usual friends of the Catholics, as to the fitness 
of the present time for renewed discussion. 
Upon some trifling point, too, naturally sepa- 
rated from the merits of the question, such as 
the duty of an advocate to receive, or not to 
receive, from the Catholic Committee in Dublin, 
instructions for a remote contingency, misun- 
derstanding had arisen, and personal feelings, 
not perhaps quite surmountable by the most 
dignified statesman or senator, were allowed to 
mingle with and to sway convictions long set- 
tled down, and zeal that could not be impeach- 
ed. But the leaders consented to bring the 
matter to a debate, and Gerald did not doubt, 
although apprized of what has been mentioned, 
that, when once in the field, their energy would 
appear manifest in all its former force, and that 
their friends would still rally round them, and 
ensure a majority. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH- 187 

The view of the House, as he entered it, upon 
the evening of the debate, was, however, omi- 
nous enough. It could hardly be called a full 
house ; and the careless or loud chatting of the 
members, during the disposal of some preced- 
ing routine business, so different from their 
serious silence or close whispering just before 
the opening of other debates, in the probable 
issue of which he had known them to have been 
absorbed, struck on Gerald's heart with in- 
creased foreboding. Looking more observantly 
around him, the Treasury benches seemed better 
filled than those of the Opposition, and this did 
not give him re assurance. 

The grey-headed veteran of the Roman Ca- 
tholics arose, and, notwithstanding the previous 
symptoms of indifference, commanded great at- 
tention. It was impossible for either lukewarm 
friend or determined foe to look on him, and 
listen to him, and refuse this tribute. No mat- 
ter what might be their inclinations to the 
cause, its faithful and life-long advocate stood 
before them. Sincerity, divine sincerity, the at- 
tribute that raises man nearest to his God, — sin- 
cerity, once flashed from the eagle-eye of youth, 
and still mildly beaming upon the snowy brows 



188 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

of age, could expect and obtain no less, even 
if alone with hatred. 

Recollecting the attributed differences just 
then existing between him and his Roman Ca- 
tholic clients, perhaps there might be observ- 
able some slight want of identity with them, 
not visible on former occasions ; some subdued 
independence of every consideration but the 
abstract greatness of his cause. But no other 
change could be detected. With a peculiar elo- 
quence, which gained from his own genius 
what it wanted of the academic severities of the 
old models, he still laboured to place, upon its 
broadest pediment, the question of human 
rights and freedom. Philosophy and imagina- 
tion, so seldom found together, lent their hands 
by turns, and with equal force and propriety, 
to speed his task. In the quiescence of age, 
in the experience of reason, poetical associations 
still had their influence upon him, and, through 
him, upon his hearers too. After arguing a 
position, until it gradually assumed all the fea- 
tures of truth, the religious reverence that its na- 
ture had called up, beguiled him, for instance, 
into some old cathedral, and the pealing of the 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 189 

organ-hymn through the length of the fretted 
roof, added sensations of holy influence, to the 
effects of human reasoning. He sat down ; 
and, so soon as feeling could change into ad- 
miration, the cheer that greeted the veteran 
was the united voice of the House. 

And here ended the interest of the evening. 
To Gerald's surprise and mortification, neither 
the friends nor the enemies of the measure went 
to much trouble in supporting or opposing it. 
That the venerable Henry Grattan should be 
heard at length, seemed to have been fixed; 
but that a certain result should follow, as much 
in course as if he had not opened his lips, 
seemed also taken for granted on both sides. 
Shadows and skeletons of speeches were, indeed, 
put forward ; but, connected with them, the 
sole thing which challenged Gerald's attention, 
was the fact that some were, in part, delivered 
by former supporters of emancipation, who now, 
upon principles of temporary expediency, stated 
their intention not to vote for going into a com- 
mittee. His patron, the Minister, was foremost 
in the rank of expediency-men, and, of course, 
Grattan found himself in a minority. 



190 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" Why, this is worse than our debates at 
Cambridge," said Gerald to himself, as he 
made his way out of the House. 

" What 's the matter now ?"" asked his friend 
Gunning, who, with his hands and chin leaning 
on his stick, had been sitting, introduced by a 
member, listening to Grattan's speech, under 
the gallery. 

" Walk out with me and you shall hear," 
answered Gerald, offering his arm. 

" Move slower, if we are to stay together," 
said Gunning, not relishing Gerald's bustling 
through the crowds in the lobby. " Stop a mo- 
ment," — it was only an excuse to take breath 
and balance himself — " there 's the little wooden 
pillar," touching it with his stick, " that was 
covered the other day with poor Perceval's 
blood." 

They gained the piazzas and — "Well ?" — con- 
tinued Gunning. Gerald stated all his surprise, 
his disappointment, and his mortification. I 
omitted to mention that, in the moderate tem- 
perature in which he found the House, he had 
magnanimously spurned the notion of throwing 
away upon it his " cram" speech. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 191 

" And is that all ?"" resumed Gunning ; — 
" why, how would you have it ? There has 
been more talk, to be sure, on former occasions ; 
but what good did that do ? — what good would 
it do now to you, or me, or any body ?" 

" It would advance the question." 

" Not a peg. Come ; you have left school, 
and ought to be growing into a practical man. 
It is very fine for a statesman of one-and-twenty 
to tell us that we should give up a certainty for 
a probability." 

" Pray tell me more particularly what you 
mean."" 

" As particularly as you like. Englishmen 
know that they enjoy their present independ- 
ence; their liberty to read, and think, and 
speak, without a book-censor, or an inquisitor ; 
to go to church or stay at home of a rainy 
Sunday ; to pass a shovel-hat in the street with- 
out being afraid of it, — these, and other com- 
forts, they know they possess, chiefly because 
Romanists have been and are kept down. And 
do you think that they will set Romanists up 
again, upon the remotest chance of losing any 
one of their pleasant privileges "^ — or, most sa-

pient legislator, even upon the chance of taking 
the sting out of the Romanists by making them 
all good Church of England-men ?" 

" I thought, Mr. Gunning, that a little more 
of generosity of motive and view might have 
come to the consideration of this question,"" said 
Gerald, half forsaking what he thought his own 
exclusive grounds of advocacy. 

*' Why should it ? — Generosity ! what 's that ? 
— amongst men of sense, even of the best feeling, 
properly directed, it can and ought to mean no 
more than promoting others' interests without in- 
juring your own. In any other definition, it be- 
comes wild and unprincipled impulse, destructive 
to its possessor, and dangerous to the well-being 
of society. Here is a clear case of almost cer- 
tain injury to ourselves by obliging others, and 
therefore here can be no generosity, as you 
call it." 

** These are your true sentiments ?"*' 

" To be sure they are ; and the true senti- 
ments of the maj(jrity, I tell you, of true Eng- 
lishmen — I don't care a straw about the word 
Protestant — Englishmen will do. We are re- 
flecting people — selfish, if you will — and I do 
believe, that what in other countries is called 



THE ANGLO IRISH. 193 

amor patria is, amongst us, nothing but a huge 
conglomeration of love of ourselves ; but I am 
glad of it ; I like selfishness ; there's sense in it ; 
there 's the germ of universal good in it ; be- 
cause, where every man in a country takes care 
of himself, all the men of a country will pros- 
per, and, better than that, be independently 
prosperous. I'm selfish myself; I take care of 
myself ; and 'tis because I do take care of my- 
self that I would not give another single chance 
of injuring me to these Catholics : and, I say 
again, 'tis because millions of men are of my 
mind that, till minds and things change, they 
must stay as they are." 

" I am sorry, Mr. Gunning, since it happens 
to be partly a religious question, that some 
slight religious feelings, either drawn from my 
view, or from the charitable spirit of Christia- 
nity, do not seem to influence the heavy majo- 
rity you would claim on your side." 

" Religious fiddlestick ! Charitable politics 
indeed ! all very fine for school-dreams, but ri- 
diculous when forming any part of the calcula- 
tions of a man of the world. But stop ; since 
you Aflue brought in the Church, there's the 
most holy and apostolic bench, who, though not

exactly with mcj are against i/ou. And how do 
you hope to dispose of them ? Have you never 
chanced to suppose that one of thj first results 
of Catholic emancipation in Ire' ^nd would be a 
strong effort, at least, to overhaul the rent-rolls 
or tithe-rolls of the Establishment ? And — al- 
though I have nothing to do with them — are 
you vab'ant enough to hope that the anointed 
lords, and their family connexions, the other 
lords, who, taken together, form, and always 
must form, two thirds of the Upper House, will 
ever contemplate a measure leading, even by 
possibility, to church retrenchment ? This is 
all as old as the moon's horns to me, but you 
really seem to have to think of it, yet." 

" But, notwithstanding your thundering pro- 
phecies, we are making way," resumed Gerald. 

" How ? — ^your question has passed the Com- 
mons. 'Tis lost again. 'Twill pass again; 
and will be lost again. But let it always pass, 
and go up to the petticoat Lords, what will you 
have gained ? what way made .'' Members of 
the Cabinet now and then vote with you. The 
votes of the same number of the dumb men 
would count as much. When you make it a

point. But it passes the Commons now, and 
some Ministers vote for it, and this did not hap_ 
pen twenty years ago. Granted. Not an inch 
of way really made yet. The true obstacles 
remain as undiminished as ever. Is it possible 
that in these seeming lapses into liberality, as 
you call it, you, a senator and a philosopher, 
see much more than the well-calculated appear- 
ances permitted, nay, organized, for the purpose 
of keeping the wild Irish people from playing 
the devil, out and out ? — ' Evidences of the 
march of mind,' and so forth I know you call 
them. Stuff. If a certain finger but wagged, 
they would, few as they are, vanish like your 
poetical mist of the morning. Do tell your dear 
Irish connexions not to be making so many mis- 
takes. But no — ^no, don't. If the delusion be 
broken, they may kick up their heels, and that 
might annoy us just now ; though as Wellesley 
is going on so well in the Peninsula, perhaps we 
may soon not care whether you do or not." 

If what certain finger wagged.''" asked 
Gerald. 

" Oh dear, oh dear !" cried Mr. Gunning, 
half affecting, half feeling peevishness ; " what 
am I to do with him ? — Hark you, our States-

stead of four or fifteen, in the Commons, and 
I'll praise you; next get the bishops to give 
you a majority of one, and I'll praise you 
more; — and — (whisper) — then get a Royal as- 
sent, drawn from the coronation -oath and the 
conscience-keeper, and then — 

' Thy stone, oh Sisyphus ! stands still, 
Ixion rests upon his wheel. 
And' — the wild Irish ' dance' —

'* Ay," ruminated Gerald, now left alone ; 
" there might indeed have been other changes, 
as my patron says, than the change of Irish 
orators to an English Parliament, contemplated 
and meant by Mr. Pitt, in that clause ; and if 
only half of what Gunning asserts, exists in 
fact, the people of Ireland have been indeed, 
and are, allowed to make great fools of them- 
selves. Wretched people ! — And, in the same 
view the Minister and I vote according to our 
fancies, without lett or hindrance ; — ^pshaw ! 
I'm tired already ; there is nothing to be done 
but to assimilate them ; though, how that itself 
is to be done, no one will let me think."

CHAPTER X. 

**Next Wednesday evening," read Gerald 
out of a Morning Paper, some weeks after, " the 
Countess of Kilbane gives her first evening 
party, this season." 

" And I am to go, and here was I thinking 
it a week farther off," he continued, addressing 
Lord Clangore. " And that very day, too, we 
dine with the Minister, I believe, Walter." 

" Yes ; but you will have full time for her 
ladyship." :| 

" You forget his lady's conversazione.'''' 

" No, even allowing for that." 
, " Do you go ?" 

** I rather think — no," answered Lord Clan- 
gore tiredly ; " to you it will be agreeable 
enough, even if Lady Kilbane, or her friend Lady 
Offally, asks you to take some of the heavy 
business of their Irish-improvement-society off

their hands ; you can laugh, or accept the ho- 
nour, just as you like, and then otherwise 
amuse yourself ; but I 've been asked so often, 
'tis death ; and then, from my ' official im- 
portance,' as they say, I am a mark for being 
asked again." 

" What is the Society about .?" 

** Mercy, Gerald; don't put such a question!" 

" Will it do any good ?" 

"Ah, how can I tell.? Gro to Lady Kil- 
bane's, and ask there, and listen — you have only 
to listen — and then judge for yourself." 

" A countess in her own right, you say ?" 

** Yes —and married twice ; and now, at for- 
ty-five, the Countess of Kilbane is still eligible 
to matrimony ; try if she 's not ; for I do sus- 
pect your many questions about her Ladyship, 
as well as about her unincumbered tract of 
Irish hills and bogs, Gerald." 

" No, sister Ann ; I 've not courage enough 
for a female blue-beard; but I'll go and see 
her." 

At about half past nine o' clock, next Wed- 
nesday night, Gerald accordingly escaped from 
a conversazione that was waxing heavy to his 
apprehension, and soon found his carriage stopt 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 199 

half the street away from the blaze of light in 
front of Lady Kilbane's mansion. After enjoy- 
ing many minutes the usual noisy emulation 
between different coachmen before him ; their 
scolding and calling names, and sometimes 
their flagellating each other, mixed with the 
dictatorial orders and commands of officers and 
constables, or the shouting of the curious crowd 
round the door, as a panel or spoke gave way 
when its enthroned director would not ; Gerald 
at last gained the skirts of a fashionable throng, 
who, immediately in advance of him, were enter- 
ing the hall, or bustling up the stairs. Before he 
could make much way, a strange double-knock 
sounded at the door, now closed behind him ; 
and, as he turned in quick surprise, a servant 
admitted a strange-looking visitor. This was 
a little old man, low, fat, and waddling in his 
gait, with a healthy red and white but most vul- 
gar face, a vast bald head, and wearing, loosely 
buttoned about him, a kind of easy great-coat, 
misshaped and uncouth, and of a coarse mate- 
rial, such as, to Gerald's eye, seemed of fo- 
reign manufacture. 

" Is your lady in the place. Sir T^ — asked 
this person of a sneering servant, speaking in 



200 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

an Irish brogue, too broad even for the gross 
stage caricature, as he slowly took pf his na- 
tional wrap-rascal and handed it to be put by, 
now showing himself clad all in new black, and 
standing in a pair of hob-shoes, covered, as was 
the skirt of the great-coat, with the mire of the 
streets, through which he had tramped to the 
rendezvous of elegance and fashion. 

" Tell her Ladyship, then, that Misther Cor- 
nelius O'Hanlon is here below," he resumed, 
after the attendant had answered in his own 
way, and, half shrinking back, accepted, be- 
tween a finger and thumb, the precious article 
committed to his care — " but stop, my friend," 
still pursued Mr. O'Hanlon — "there's some- 
thing in the right-hand pocket of that snug 
coat I '11 be asking from you ; it isn't with 
these upon my feet I *d go up to her Lady- 
ship," smiling and pointing to his brogues, as 
they might be — "but as the streets were so bad 
for walking, I just drew them on to save the 
clane pair I put in the pocket : — give 'em, and 
I'll thank you ; I can just sit down here, in the 
corner of the hall, while the company is mo- 
ving up, and put them on the poor feet." 
' The scandalized attendant indignantly led 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 201 

him into a room off the hall ; and by the time 
that Gerald gained the middle of the stairs, 
Mr. O'Hanlon, holding with both hands by the 
bannisters, and his clean shoes creaking at 
every step, waddled to his side, and, Gerald 
drawing back, passed him. 

Looking through the door which allowed a 
view of the spot Lady Kilbane had chosen to 
receive her visitors, Gerald soon after saw him 
make his bow, and (but not until he had stood 
some time, evidently to her embarrassment, at 
the side of his hostess,) turn off with another 
singular-looking man, and retire to a corner. 
Mr. O'Hanlon's acquaintance showed, indeed, 
little of the peculiar vulgarity which fully in- 
vested himself; yet it was almost as startling to 
see, in such a situation, one or other of the gen- 
tlemen. His face was not, like Mr. D'Hanlon's, 
broad, round, and ruddy, and surmounted by 
a shining ball of bare skull; yet its swarthy 
paleness, its close deep expression, its large 
black watchful eyes, and the sleek black hair 
that ran straight across the forehead, within an 
inch of the brows, gave, no more than did Mr. 
CHanlon's, any notion of rank, or even of gen- 
tlemanly habits of mind or person. 
K 5 



202 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" Defend me !" thought Gerald ; " amid the 
refinements of this assemblage and place ; amid 
Lady Kilbane's tasteful decorations, her flowers, 
her plants, her furniture, her music, her blazing 
lamps, and her little army of sumptuous atten- 
dants, how, or why, in the name of taste and 
probability, are those two persons found here ?" 

He caught, for an instant, the eye of his 
highly-rouged hostess, and, as he took a step 
towards her, Gerald's surprise did not abate in 
consequence of some words of (though they 
were not addressed to him) explanation upon 
the very puzzle that absorbed him. 

A serious, if not stately lady, of the middle 
age, leaning upon the arm of — Gerald knew — 
her husband, as serious, and claiming by his 
brow and air to be still more stately than she, 
were passing Lady Kilbane, after a salute, when 
the lady's glances fixed on Mr. O'Hanlon, now 
at a distance, and, in obvious wonder, she di- 
rected her husband's attention, by looking into 
his face, towards that individual. 

" Ask me could I have helped it, dear Lady 
OfTally," whispered Lady Kilbane, loud enough, 
however, to be heard by Gerald, " and 1 answer 
I never thought of the poor gentleman till this 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 20S 

very day, after the Education Meeting, where, 
you know, he said so much to the purpose in 
furtherance of our exertions; and then, you 
may remember, you left him chatting at the 
door with Mr. Loupe and me, and I was com- 
pelled to interrupt what he was advising, and 
defer it to another time, when, in the great 
simplicity of heart that so much characterizes 
him, he proposed to attend me, at my house, 
this evening ; and as Mr. Loupe was by, and is 
his friend, patron rather, and all of us willing 
to meet Mr. Loupe any where, and he so anx- 
ious too, to get O'Hanlon in wherever good 
may be done — in fact, I was compelled to say 
yes ; the trouble being, however," continued 
Lady Kilbane, with a smile, " to have him un- 
derstand that he was not to call * at tay-time.'" 

" Perhaps, indeed," said Lady OfFally, " good 
may be done by making Mr. O'Hanlon more 
known ; and, after all, his peculiarities are not 
his faults.'' 

" And having run such risks with his old 
friends," resumed Lady Kilbane, " he is enti- 
tled to our protection. Besides, a little atten- 
tion of this kind will make him what he is so 
anxious to become, for the sake of the new cause 



204 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

he engages in — more English than, without us, 
he could possibly be." 

Lord and Lady Offally passed on, and 
Gerald saw an opportunity to make his bow to 
Lady Kilbane, and, immediately after, he was 
obliged, without a word, to yield place to a 
group of new guests. Turning away, the sound 
of a stick, on the carpet, at measured intervals, 
caught his ear from behind ; and a glance round 
showed him his old acquaintance Mr. Gunning. 

" The trio of originals complete !" — said 
Gerald, " though his presence here is not so 
surprising." 

" I was off but that I saw you," said Gun- 
ning. 

" Tired so soon ?" 

** Yes — of the two men I 've just left yon- 
der.'' 

" What two r 

" One of them a countryman of yours." 

" I am not quite Irish, you know.'' 

" Well — that's the very thing he says ; half- 
Irish." 

" Tell me about him." 

" Mr. Cornelius O'Hanlon was, till about 
two years ago, a hedge-schoolmaster in the 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 205 

kingdom of Kerry, teaching his ragged boys to 
bless themselves and * consther' Homer, and 
going to mass every Sunday, and to heaven, 
as his Milesian sires had gone before him. 

" But some echoes of some of the Bible-meet- 
ings got up by you half-Irish people, and, 
indeed, by us whole-English people, found their 
way to Mr. O'Hanlon, in the solitude of his 
thatched seminary ; and, either getting a call, 
or curious to try a new calling, he turned round 
upon his parish-priest, and became a stout 
biblical. Perhaps he had wit enough to anti- 
cipate that the novelty of his appearance in the 
field would, as much as any thing else, create an 
interest for him ; I mean his personal as well 
as any other appearance ; in fact, the real, living 
descendant of a hundred old popish Milesians, 
coming over in his frieze coat at sixty years of 
age, ynih his luscious brogue, and his rustic 
simplicity, as it were, a converted soul from the 
darkness of Popery to the light of Scripture- 
knowledge, might, even to Mr. Cornelius's 
innocent thoughts, be a very picturesque and 
effective matter." 

„ Has he since lived in London ?"" 

" Chiefly, I believe ; the resentment of his 



206 THE ANGLO-IRISH, 

former friends, in Ireland, and all that, not 
being a thing to be faced ; and it is marvellous 
in what places I have met him, telling his 
smooth Kerry stories about himself and his 
conversion, and the thirst he had left, before he 
quitted them, upon the souls of his bog-trotting 
countrymen, for the word of life,— and all such 
admirable matter." 

" Now, his friend, Mr. Loupe." 

*' Oh, I see you've heard of him, then. I 
can't well make that man out. But ask Lady 
Kilbane; perhaps she can. This is her fifth 
season in town, since the death of her second 
spouse; and as, whether from fear of her, or 
that she grows so vast, to say nothing else, few 
among her own set seem over anxious to give 
her a third chance (between you and me, the 
first two died of her) ; as this is whispered to be 
the case, her ladyship, now arrived at the se- 
rious days of life, becomes Godly, and is given 
to religious societies, religious meetings, and 
Mr. Loupe." 

" Where did she find him ?" 

" I don't know. Nobody knows where lie 
came from, or to what country or tribe he be- 
longs. Purely for the sake of poking him out, 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 207 

I have myself been at the trouble of talking to 
Mr. Loupe ; but while the language he speaks 
is certainly not English, but rather a kind of 
foreign idiom translated into English words, 
and those words not every-day words either, 
but the strangest old-fashioned cant, picked out 
of the Old Testament, still I hesitate to call 
him German, Italian, Turk, or Hamburg Jew. 
My best surmise, however, is, that he has been 
an old clothes-man.'* 

" A Jewish convert ?"" 

" Don 't ask me, I tell you ; his own rigma- 
role account of himself is the puzzle. If you 
credit him, we have the honour of redeeming 
him, not from an aversion to pork, but from a 
professorship in the Vatican, I believe; and 
he farther talks of having been at the tops of a 
great many mountains in Asia, distributing, 
with permission of Popish Patriarchs, that 's 
the best of it, half-crown Bibles to Jews and 
Romanists he found there. And he has been, 
or is to be, in Ireland, too, assisting Mr. Priest- 
ly, who is here to-night, and Lord Harmer, 
and yourself, and the whole of you, in the 
reformation of that popish country. Go and 
speak to him ; he will delight you." 



208 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

Mr. Gunning turned away, but Gerald did 
not follow his advice. He saw matter more 
attractive for conversation. Through the open 
door of a second room appeared his old ac- 
quaintance, Lady Cox, sitting upon a sofa, and 
listening gravely, and, he thought, stupidly, to 
a young dragoon officer, who, his complete dress 
of scarlet half hid in lace, and his spurs intrud- 
ed amongst flounces and slippers, sat, lounging 
sideways, the very prince of elegant puppies, as, 
with persevering smiles and ceaseless sentences, 
he lispingly addressed her. The young and 
pretty Lady Cox had changed in appearance 
since Gerald and she last met. Her fine form 
was more matured ; it displayed a womanly 
luxury of line ; but, Gerald thought, had an air 
of indifference to its own appearance, a neglect 
of display, that might be called half sad, half 
slovenly, and that the impression of the hand- 
some face to which it belonged farther illus- 
trated. While Lady Cox wore her splendid 
dress in almost the carelessness of dishabille, 
her slightly-pencilled black eye-brows — t,o the 
destruction of the perfect arch Gerald remem- 
bered them to have once described — without 
positive frowning almost touched her eyelids ; 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 209 

those lids half closed over the dark eyes, that 
used, when nearly rounded in natural expan- 
sion, to flash good humour and enjoyment on 
every side ; and her small, full lips, of which 
the former habit had been to remain apart, 
out-breathing the joyous spirit within, were 
now closed in a hard, discontented pout, the 
linder-one pressed into little wrinkles, and 
changed from ruby-red to a cold, bloodless 
colour. Her cheeks, indeed, were rounder than 
ever, assisted, perhaps, in this character, by 
the firm closing of her mouth. 

It was evident, as has been intimated, that 
she did not care one farthing about all the lan- 
guid efforts made by her military fop to interest 
her ; and yet Gerald felt an unnecessary impa- 
tience of the self-assumed ease with which he 
lisped on, so close at her ear. Who was he who 
could thus engage, indeed monopolize, so inter- 
esting a woman ? — " And what is that to you .''" 
asked Gerald's common sense of Gerald's non- 
sense. " Pho !"" answered would-be wisdom ; " I 
have known her and her husband ; and her hus- 
band is not now at her side, and this dandy is ; 
that 'sail.'' 

Lady Cox, turning lazily, caught his eye at 



210 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

the moment, and, as she half clapped her small 
gloved hands, a change came over her dull ex- 
pression of face and manner, that in a degree 
restored both to their old character. Gerald did 
not pause to analyse the nature of the interest 
with which he now rapidly stepped up to her. 
They met ; and Lady Cox would have " an 
Irish shake-hands from her old friend Gerald 
Blount." 

" Blount .P" lisped the young officer, at her 
side, " Gerald Blount r 

" Flood ! is it possible V and Gerald with 
some difficulty recognised his Westminster 
class-mate. They had not met since Gerald left 
school for College ; Flood, at the early age of 
sixteen, having entered into active service on 
the Peninsula. So here was what ought to be 
one of the proverbially delightful meetings be- 
tween old school-fellows, long separated, and 
again coming in contact with each other in man- 
hood, and in the world. Gerald, indeed, was 
almost springing to shake Flood's hand, when 
an extended little finger of that gallant person, 
covered with white shining kid, seemed to give 
the cue for moderate transports. There was no 
superciliousness in the action, no half-cutting ; — 



THE ANGLO IRISH. 211 

considering; the whole character of the man, ab- 
solutely no coldness even ; Gerald did not there- 
fore draw back, or draw up ; but, after a mo- 
ment's quick reasoning, advanced a little finger 
in return, and was only very much amused. 

Friendship of boyhood ! delicious is your re- 
collection said to be, but sad are your common 
fate and history. After all that has been be- 
lieved to the contrary, how seldom does your 
scented blossom bring forth ripe fruit ! I tread 
in imagination within the now deserted precincts 
of the old school-house, where to know was to 
attach and be attached, and a friend meets me 
in every young shiny face, and in the accents of 
every gabbling tongue ; I quit my dream, and, 
standing out in the world, I look round for 
those faces, and listen for those accents; and, 
alas ! I see them not — I hear them not ! Some 
of the old familiar features are changed into 
coldness or dislike ; a word, I may have 
penned or spoken, and forgotten — an articu- 
lated pufP of breath has made them enemies ; 
others are estranged from the mere maturity of 
different characters within us, that in the 
little miniature world of the school-house had 
not developed themselves, or had been unno- 



SIS THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

ticed, or mistaken ; — and others still vail to my 
glance, in the sad inferiority of social degrada- 
tion. Oh ! of the fading of many into the con- 
fusing shadows of the tomb, I speak not, think 
not ; but of the fortunes of those friends of 
childhood and of boyhood, whom in every other 
way I have lost, a tale might be told, exhibit- 
ing in epitome all the causes for regret, for 
moralizing, for tiredness of human life and ex- 
perience, for very dislike of human nature, and 
yet, more than all, for the revellings of human 
pity, to an extent, and in a diversity, that would 
startle, with truth and wonder, every heart ! — 
Ay, were I to show how, one by one, the smil- 
ing eyes of youthful friendship grew cold or 
abashed to mine, and how, scarcely with an ex- 
ception, they left me to form, in the unnerving 
scrutiny of observation, new preferences, new 
facilities for enjoying life, I must necessarily 
compile a journal of true romance, so absorbing, 
so wretched, and in some instances, so terrible, 
that the philosophy which would confine its 
study to man, need not require with it a se- 
cond volume, in order to grow perfect in know- 
ledge, in reflection, and in disgust ! 

*' My excellent fellow, how d' ye do ?" asked 



THE \NGLO-IRISH. 213 

Flood, in a shrill variation of tone from his or- 
dinary flippant lisp, as their little fingers touch- 
ed : — " and where have you been lost during the 
awful and tradesman-like lapse of, I take it, 
seven whole years since we parted at Westmin- 
ster ? I've caught, it strikes me, a confused 
notion of your recent visibility among human 
affairs, and, I rather believe, was to have in- 
quired you out, or some such thing; but, friend 
of my youth, and all that, to what purpose have 
you breathed, I still venture to ask, until the 
month before the last, or thereabout ?'' 

Gerald, good humouredly, gave an account 
of himself. " As to you. Flood," he continued, 
" I thought, but that I meet you here to-night, 
I should have been at no trouble to supply a 
general idea of your life, during the same period 
of seven years ; but I suppose you have only 
just been dispatched home from the Peninsula." 

" Ah, no! too flattering biographer; more than 
five years, as they told me, I was, indeed, now 
and then bored, along with many others, in march- 
ing and countermarching after the very tiresome 
French people, and sometimes put to the trouble 
of marching on before them, and sometimes of 
knocking them on the head, or of taking a knock 



214 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

from them" — this, to Gerald's observation, was 
indeed apparent ; for from beneath the fair and 
well-curled and well-oiled hair of the narrator 
issued a sabre cut, that obliquely traversed his 
round boyish cheek, proclaiming, amid the very 
consummation of coxcombry of character, some 
abiding portion of the cool, unostentatious bravery 
that, in the case of the young Irishman, Wil- 
liams, had distinguished him at school ; indeed, 
of his bravery, as well as of his other good quali- 
ties. Flood never was ostentatious; but, amusing 
to say, no human being took more pains to dis- 
play his own follies and nonsense ; — " and so 
wore away the dull time — but nay ; ungrateful 
and oblivious that I am ;— thus it did not. I've 
but mentioned the exceedingly tedious accidents 
of life ; its real business went on among the 
sunny cottages or curious old family castles of 
the fair south, where sun-burnt beauty, not 
less beauty for all that, tended the war-worn 
man, night and day, or with guitar and castanet 
made him dances in the noon-tide shade — vastly 
natural, fine women, the women of those coun- 
tries, Lady Cox ; — and black hair, black eyes, 
high foreheads, and httle, little red mouths, and 
the shape tending to the embonpoint^ quite their 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 215 

Standard of beauty, suffer me to assure you." 
This digression was delivered in a lisp of, to Ge- 
rald^s ear, confounded impudence, as the half 
closed eyes of Flood languidly glanced from one 
to another of the characteristics he enumerated, 
so obvious in the face and form of Lady Cox ; 
** And then, good Blount, all this apart, one does 
get such things, and, if one will be at the trou- 
ble, learn such things, in those abroad-places ; 
it is enormously agitating to bring matters to 
mind, as connected with dates and localities ; 
but, as it just now strikes me, it was at or 
about a village called Niza, while domesticated 
in the prettiest villa in Portugal, among the 
freshest-hearted creatures. Lady Cox, that I 
had the happiness to obtain my two dozen of 
undoubted Barcelonas ; in the citadel, or some 
such part, of Badajos, an old Frenchman, my 
prisoner on parole, after that excessively annoy- 
ing affair, gave me, out of pure gratitude, my 
peerless marasquina — and oil-of-lavender-black- 
ing receipt, which I would not exchange for a 
majority ; an ancient man, with a vastly long 
beard, Turkish I fancy, who attended our camp 
near Merida, let me have, after days of negoti- 
ations, for fifty pounds, my box of cigars, (in- 



S16 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

eluding my amber cigar-tube,) of which even 
the yet unexhausted portion is beyond double the 
money ; — my incomparable Poodle — (some aver 
the original chien Munito; he can do such 
things. Lady Cox — every thing but speak, — 
and sometimes he rather startles me with that 
too, as we sit alone together, I not minding 
him, over my meerchaum, and he at last losing 
patience, asking me to play with him,) — my 
Poodle, I say, I picked up on the road to Bur- 
gos ; this quiz-chain, true Asiatic twist and joint, 
and weighing above half a pound of gold, cost 
me a little trouble ; — at Talavera, if I do not 
atrociously err, I happened to see one of our 
fellows disposed to sabre a young officer of the 
very teazing enemy, who was already down, 
and, you know, the case required me to go to 
the trouble of taking the cut on my own sword ; 
but the uncommon inconvenience the young 
Frenchman put me to did him no good, for the 
bullet he had previously received was abun- 
dantly sufficient for him, without the favour 
intended by our rascal; in truth, I imagine he 
did not hold out above a few minutes after I 
spoke to him ; but the youth fancied I was so 
friendly that his very last words endowed me 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 217 

with this trophy. I value it on his account 
as well as its own," continued Flood, " for even 
during the very limited period of our mortal ac- 
quaintance I had a notion — though I do deeply 
sicken at what you philosophers, my Blount, 
call observation of character — I had, however, 
an excessively slight notion that I might have 
liked the lad, provided he could have arranged 
to stand up, take my arm, and limp with me to 
my quarters, and afterwards live, like a rational 
person, some time within the sphere of my ac- 
quaintance. Poor fellow !" he went on, forget- 
ting for an instant his affectation, much to Ge- 
rald's delight, though immediately after he re- 
sumed it — " poor fellow ! he pressed my hand 
too, in their violent French way ; and it occurs 
to me as possible that the absolutely last word 
he tried, and could not finish, was — ' mother !' 
but confound him, — that's all such vast non- 
sense." 

The self-compelling military dandy here took 
out a gold snuff-box, but with a " bah ! — only 
my engine-turned," put it up again and pro- 
duced a second, an antique, richly and curiously 
embossed, and adding *' ay — here is the true

high-dried !" exquisitely flattered his nasal appe- 
tite with a few grains held on the upturned 
thumb. 

" Ahj poor, vain human nature I" said Lady 
Cox in an " aside," that only Gerald heard, 
and that was uttered very gravely, and follow- 
ed by a little groan. He did not know what 
to make of the expression, or of the manner 
and cadence accompanying it ; but supposing 
the present moment unfelicitous for hinting at 
an explanation, turned again to his old school- 
fellow. 

" How do our mere countrymen get on in 
the field, Flood .?" 

" The question rather preposterously sup- 
poses one disposed to make observations," re- 
plied Flood, proceeding with his pinch ; " but 
against any such inexpressibly curious chimera, 
I 've a faint notion my voice has before been 
slightly heard. However, people you are 
amongst do talk of those things, and it does, 
in a most shadowed manner, occur to me that 
I may produce some remote resemblance of an 
answer to your serious and incommodious ques- 
tion, worthy Blount. Generally, then, you will 
comprehend that our mere and dear Irish con- 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 219 

nexions do not get on at all ; that is, I incline 
to believe, using the term in the sense of ad- 
vancing themselves in the noncommissioned 
list, or in the particular estimation of discipli- 
narians ; but nothing inclining by it to aver 
that, in the field, with the bayonet, they do 
not get on considerably, one may suppose, to 
the inconvenience of the enemy, and, it may 
be added, in a monstrously ferocious way. My 
most esteemed parent, Sir Robert Flood, has 
had the honour of counting some regiments of 
them in his brigade ; and from him, and many 
other people, (if one could be bored by minute 
recollection of things,) as well, I may distantly 
venture to intimate, as by one's individual re- 
marks, (if, again, one could always be bound 
to recall the matters that one's eyes present 
to one's comprehension,) but by those several 
means, perhaps, it has reached me that the 
pure Hibernian fellows on the Peninsula may 
be said to be exceedingly good for close and 
hot work ; for instance — as I fancy I have 
just now indicated — the turning a wing with 
the steel ; or taking the forlorn-hope across a 
lake or river, in open boats, under a three- 
tiered battery of grape, into some kind of 
L 2 



220 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

breach or other, upon which no ordinarily- 
rational person would make attempt, even sup- 
posing the open-boat business remotely out 
of the question; and now it does occur, in' a 
less faint shape, that at the word ' prepare to 
charge !' they are in the preposterous habit of 
taking off and hiding under some bush or 
stone their shoes and gaiters, and then gal- 
lopping forward, rather than observing the al- 
lotted double quick time, with very extraor- 
dinary yells, to the column pointed out for 
their work" — and Flood went on, his sympa- 
thizing bravery once more nearly putting his 
affectation out—" I 've an idea, like that of a 
scattered dream, of some such event, that once, 
while on such a forlorn-hope as T in the second 
instance glanced at, they used to send up, from 
their little boats, the same atrocious descrip- 
tion of national war-whoop, for every shower of 
grape and shell that came from the old fortress, 
though with it, portions and members of them- 
selves flew rather numerously over the water, 
and boats sunk or turned up, and so forth, 
until by the time a landing happened to occur, 
one fellow out of twenty might have been in 
a convenient state to efi^ect it ; but to all this 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 221 

let it be added that the provost-serjeants, and 
the trees of Portugal and Spain were much 
inconvenienced by them, in consequence of 
their occasional abduction, upon, perhaps, a 
forced march, or sometimes during some- 
thing resembling a run, as from Burgos, of 
such hens and ducks, kids, lambs and little 
pigs, as were to be found in the track of a 
column." 

" In fact," said Gerald, " they are occasion- 
ally good auxiliaries in a field ; but an army 
exclusively composed of them " 

" Would, it occurs to me, be with consider- 
able facility outmanoeuvred, surrounded, cut 
off from supplies, or such things," interrupted 
Flood. 

" But not as easily beaten hand to hand ?" 
still questioned Gerald. 

" Possibly not — that is, if you are disposed 
somewhat explicitly to mean, good Blount, the 
very limited portion of success, in rather exten- 
sive affairs, which may be said to depend on 
mere fighting." 

" I 've heard you mention you had not lately 
returned from the Peninsula, Flood." 

" My good Blount, if I were to particularly 



222 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

tax my memory, I do suppose nearly two hu- 
man years have elapsed since my excellent fa- 
ther sent me, not to England, but to dear, dear 
Ireland, to be nursed, as he and my Irish old- 
maiden friends called it, out of the accidental 
results of a hurt I had had the honour to receive 
at Fm sure I will not now aver where." 

** I remember it, however," said Gerald, 
" and remember, too, that the newspaper list 
gave but few hopes to an old school-fellow of 
ever seeing you again, though it had missed me 
that we are indebted to Irish hands for almost 
completely restoring your visage to its original 
comeliness." 

" It was not this, my excellent fellow," touch- 
ing his cheek, " but rather one of the French 
rausket-balls, so remarkably smaller than ours, 
which caused the slight inconvenience we allude 
to : a few months, however, in Ireland,again made 
your ancient friend fit for the aspirations after 
the tented field, and so forth, that I can recol- 
lect we used so poetically to read of, now and 
then, at Westminster ; and my gracious parent 
received due intimation of the circumstance. 
But he was pleased to impose his commands for 
a still longer sojourn in the greenest isle in the 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 223 

world ; and to render his sentence remotely to- 
lerable, your exile became appointed aid-du- 
camp to the deputy King of that emerald coun- 
try ; nay, and held his distinguished appoint- 
ment until within a very few days ago, under 
the successor of the vice-regal monarch it was 
his felicity first to serve. And oh ! curious- 
minded and man-and-thing-observing Blount ! 
why were you not in my place, to be inexpres- 
sibly the better for all I saw and heard, — but, 
for your inestimable sake be it regretted, cannot 
now accurately call up to improve you ? Some 
snatches of the agreeable dream I was, however, 
attempting for Lady Cox's attentive ear, before 
you condescended to join us." 

" Go on, go on," said Gerald. 

" School-mate, never distress one by asking 
in so impatient a way ; but I conjecture I had, 
when you came up, just been noticing to her 
Ladyship, the regal state and observances of 
my first Irish Sovereign. He was a big, a very 
big vice-king, addicted, out of patronage of his 
adopted people, to playing of rackets, and im- 
bibing the illicit distillation of their mountain 
corn. As one of his pun-gtnt Dublin judges 
said of his own situation, my monarch kept a 



224 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

racket-court — be it permitted to his Excel- 
lency's ex-servant to add, inside his castle, 
as well as out of it. The never-fading ho- 
nour has been mine to hold the deputy royal 
hat, coat, and vest, (and dram and bottle, 
too,) while, clad in Welsh flannel, his mus- 
cular arm struck out the bounding racket- 
ball. The unpretending individual who sits 
before you has listened twice, or, could he 
boast a memory, perhaps more than that, to 
the historical anecdote of the York whisker, its 
destruction and scattering to the winds of Hea- 
ven, by the fierce pistol-bullet of his illustrious 
chief. 

" Under this, my first master, we were all 
Orange.'' 

" Do, Flood," interrupted Gerald, " since 
you must have seen and heard so much about 
it, do tell me exactly what that word means^ in 
Ireland ?" 

** Incredibly monstrous question, fellow-stu- 
dent. Hope nothing from us, * exactly.' One 
cannot be an Irish party prism in your philo- 
sophic hands, to collect, so very precisely, the 
intellectual rays, that, in your paternal land, 
fascinate the eye with orange, blue, or green. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 225 

We were Orange, I aver, and I aver no more. 
Our court graciously received Orange addresses, 
congratulations, and duteous requests not to go 
away, and we vouchsafed affectionate answers. 
There was a statue of a man with a philibeg on 
horseback, in the middle of a Dublin street, and 
this was our Jaggernaut ; and neither the old 
man of the sea, nor the metal man that rowed 
a boat round the adamantine mountain, nor yet 
the metal horse on the top of that mountain, 
three personages to be met with, 1 fancy, in 
the pleasant volumes of the Arabian Nights' 
Entertainments, ever created a more absorbing 
interest. The question was, should the egg be 
broken for eating at top or bottom ? in other 
words, should this bare-legged man and his 
horse be dressed or not be dressed, with a score 
yards of ribbons, once or twice in the year ? 
Behold the grand question that agitated our 
Court. Your poor friend and orator has as- 
sisted at its discussion, and conveyed dispatches 
about it, often enough to entitle him slightly 
and modestly, to lay claim to the gratitude of 
his paternal country. 

" It does not strongly occur to me to deno- 
minate our colour under my next master. Per- 
L 5 



226 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

haps it might be speculatively called a dun- 
colour ; or, if we were Orange, we did not imme- 
diately care to blazon it forth ; or we had vastly 
more serious things to do. Our Court now 
became a proper, virtuous, well-behaved Court. 
We cultivated turnips in the lawn of our Vice- 
Regal Lodge in the Phoenix Park : and our 
Deputy-Queen and the young Princesses held 
sober drawing-rooms, or went forth arraytd in 
Dublin Liberty Tabinet, to rescue, by a sub- 
scription ball at the Rotunda, thousands of the 
vastly ingenious manufacturers of that excellent 
and glossy article, from immediate demise by 
hunger, and the dearth of Bible." 

*' Pray be less profane in your expressions, 
Captain Flood," said Lady Cox, severely. He 
flowed on without minding. 

*' There our sovereign and his consort sat on 
little thrones, and we of the household, the cor- 
poration, the law, and the prescription, formed 
around a goodly court. It was excessively en- 
tertaining. One could hardly see king and 
queen better performed at the more regular 
theatres ; and all the tabinet women of Dublin 
round about us ; all the lady-mayoresses for 
twenty years before, mostly keeping their titles, 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 227 

because during office, James, John, or Tom, 
had been dubbed Sir John, Sir James, or Sir 
Tom ; and the sheriffs* wives, too, all calling 
each other ' my lady,' and the whole of this 
being Dublin aristocracy." 

" Come, Flood, now show us a few of the 
beauties of your Rotunda assembly,'' said Ge- 
rald. 

" Indeed !" resumed Flood, speaking to him- 
self; " can it be so possible?" quite re-assuming 
the languid lisp he had lately in a degree for- 
gotten. " Yes, though — -Blount, your pardon — 
Lady Cox, yours — to think of seeing her here I" 
and with his curious quizzing-glass, suspended 
from his half-pound Asiatic gold-chain, he was 
sliding off, when the catching of his spur in one 
of Lady Cox's negligently -disposed flounces, 
caused a moment's demur. With Gerald's as- 
sistance, however, — Flood scarcely noticing the 
disaster, but still looking off — the flounce was 
quickly restored to its liberty, and at last the 
gallant young dandy clanked to a card-table, 
and they saw him address and stand over the 
chair of a very charming young girl. 

" And now he is gone," said Lady Cox, " I 
don't know when I have been so much relieved. 



228 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

He 's a very tiresome, spoilt young man. I 
knew him in Dublin ; hut, although not Inde- 
pendent in point of personal happiness of any 
proper friendly attention, his levity, and I 
repeat what I've just charged him with — his 
irreligious turn, were not the things for me." 

" How !** cried Gerald, still quite at a loss 
to make out Lady Cox in her new character, 
" and could so much merit, in every way, 
stand in need of — '''' 

" Mr. Blount,"' interrupted her Ladyship 
more gravely than ever, while her e} es sought 
the floor, '* if, at a former period of our acquaint- 
ance I was child enough to interchange such silly 
allusions and conversations, allow me to inform 
you, that reflection and good example, assisted, 
perhaps, by the want of the personal happiness I 
have before alluded to, now warn me to adopt 
a diff*efent style of speaking, as well indeed, as 
of acting. I am, let me be thankful for it," 
her dark eyes half moistened, were here lifted 
up, — " I am in time, I hope, arrived at the 
settled conviction, that in this uncertain and 
contemptible Ufe we have only one anchor, one 
true source of enjoyment." 

" Then I have the honour to think with you. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 229 

Madam," said Gerald, getting out of his puz- 
zle a little ; yet why any portion of the conver- 
sation they might have held together, during 
the short period of their last and first meeting 
should thus be so particularly, and, he thought, 
penitentially adverted to, seemed to propose a 
new puzzle, though of a different kind. 

" And,"" continued the young, and, notwith- 
standing her protest, the still almost childish 
Lady Cox — " and Mr. Blount, the reason why, 
without either affectation or doubt, I tell you 
I can draw some interest from your conver- 
sation in general society, is, because from my 
observation of your character I think you 
well-founded in religious principles at least, 
and therefore, not likely to speak as irreve- 
rently as other young men do on religious sub- 
jects." 

" How suddenly sage the lady gets ! This 
is partly sullenness, on some domestic account ; 
partly affectation, in spite of her disclaim- 
er ; and partly caught from some Dublin 
Saint-Society," thought Gerald : but, when he 
spoke aloud, he made proper acknowledgments 
for the confidence placed in him, and the honour 
done him. 



230 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

Both remained an instant silent. Then, act- 
ing upon the first partial cause ascribed by 
him for the lady's humour, he sudd.enly asked, 
looking round on every side, " Where 's Sir 
Richard ?" 

" Oh, Mr. Blount !" in almost sufficient ener- 
gy to attract twenty neighbouring eyes, " can 
you ask so cruel a question ?" 

"Cruel! I beg pardon for any mistake I 
may have made ; but let me also assure your 
Ladyship, I was unaware of any one circum- 
stance calculated to make my question disagree- 
able." 

" Then I forgive you for it ; but no more 
now ; Lady Offally, Lady Angelica Hunt, Miss 
Flint, Miss De Vere, my mamma, and all their 
coterie come this way : and do not go either ; 
what they come to talk about ought to interest 
you." 

" Is he dead ? or drinking claret, or whisky 
punch, day and night, in old Ireland ? or lying 
ill of typhus fever, or what ?'^ soliloquised 
Gerald. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 231 



CHAPTER XI. 

Op the group alluded to by Lady Cox, 
Gerald exchanged symptoms of recognition with 
Lord and Lady OfFally, with Mrs. Sparrow, 
mother to Lady Cox, and wife of an Irish 
Archdeacon, whom in softness of manner, of 
face, or person, and even of voice, she little 
resembled ; with Lords Horsemantown, and 
Harmer, and with the sombre, grand-looking 
Mr. Priestly ; and Lady OfFally made him known 
to the Lady Angelica Hunt, " her sister patro- 
ness," and to the Misses De Vere and Betsy 
Fhnt, the first " one of the Secretaries to the 
London Committee of the Parent Society ;" the 
other a Secretary also, to the most considerable 
of the very important Irish associations branch- 
ing from it. 

"Patronesses and Secretaries?" queried Ge- 
rald, as he got through his bows ; " Parent 
Society and Branching Associations? — oh, I 



232 THE ANGLO-IRISH, 

forgot; here we have the matter Clangore 
warned me of." 

" And now, Mr. Blount,*' said the seriously- 
dignified Lady OfFally, " we come to you across 
the room to make a request, and you cannot 
refuse us." 

"You won't,"" Mr. Blount, pleaded Miss Flint, 
with a fussy energy of features that had seen 
their spring-time, and that appeared cast in 
the very mould for business; " you won't, 
because we all know your sentiments on the 
subject of poor Ireland, and your disposition to 
do good of any kind, and your talents to do 
whatever you like; and when you hear how 
heavy our duties are becoming, and consider 
how much more fitted for certain parts of offi- 
cial affairs you gentlemen are, than we poor 
ladies, and the great deal more you have in 
your power, every way, — and then our loan- 
system, that cannot, according to the tiresome 
Act of Parliament, go on with security to our 
funds, unless a committee of gentlemen be 
ready to assist us in the recovering of sums 
from defaulters, and idle, cheating people, in 
every district in Ireland — think of that ; when 
you call all this to mind, I am sure, I say, you 
will afford us a hand and a heart together." 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 233 

Gerald while bowing in double acknowledg- 
ment of the compliments contained in the first 
part of this address, and of general acquiescence 
in the claim made upon him, could scarce restrain 
a smile at the facility of speech it rather omi- 
nously imported in, he ventured to surmise, 
the person of some Irish town-goody, who, 
from her recent appointment as " Secretary" 
and correspondent with the " London com- 
mittee," drew the present pride and glory of her 
existence. 

" It is, indeed, impossible," said Lady An- 
gelica Hunt, in whose full, rich, and widely 
parted lips and beautiful long neck, Gerald 
recognized the original of the companion for 
the Chapeau-de-Paille, painted by an eminent 
artist, either at her ladyship's or her honour- 
able husband's instance, and since engraved 
and hung up in all the print-shops through 
town ; — " it is, indeed, impossible that ladies 
should engage in a work of any extent without 
being frequently and painfully aware of their 
own deficiency of strength to carry it on with 
the degree of vigour, perseverance and exactness 
which they so much desire to apply to it; and 
I may add, that, fully agreeing with me, the 
honourable Everard Hunt is, so far as his in- 



234 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

tentions can go, seriously disposed to co-operate 
in our views." 

*' The degree of precision and constant at- 
tention," subjoined Miss De Vere, whose Eng- 
lish sobriety of manner, simplicity and beauty, 
interested Gerald more even than the ardour of 
her Irish sister Secretary, *' which is required 
in those who have the chief management, would 
be a mere nothing to men of business." 

** Whose hearts are interested in the service 
of their God and the welfare of their fellow- 
creatures," sighed, or rather slightly groaned 
the pious Lady Cox ; her untidy charms and 
her sullenness still keeping up, in Gerald's 
mind, a provoking, and, though they should 
not have done so, a kind of unholy interest. 

*' Nothing effective can ensue if a committee 
of gentlemen are not ready, in every part of 
Ireland, to prosecute the abominable persons 
who break faith with the society," remarked 
her Ladyship's mamma, with a frown, an out- 
curling of the under lip, and an abrupt manly 
tone, that, aided by her stature, must have 
had on any half-crown defaulter as much 
eflFect as the civil bill course she advocated. 

"Good Lord Offally," smiled Miss FHnt, 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 235 

glancing up at his Lordship, who stood in 
much dignity and a httle stiffness at her side, 
betraying, in the habitual curve of his brow, 
and in the sometimes fierce (else they might 
have been silly,) gleams of his angular eye, 
a kind of old feudal hauteur not yet laid aside 
by some of the noblemen of Ireland — " good 
Lord OfFally has been with us a long while ; 
and here 's Lord Harraer and Lord Horseman- 
town we have enlisted this evening ; and Mr. 
Priestly, too — and — where 's Captain Flood.? 
he also surrendered to my first unassisted 
attack, provided — and I assure you. Lady An- 
gelica, he was quite serious in making his terms 
— provided I agreed to let him have from one 
of our country shops half a dozen linsey-wolsey 
jackets for his next summer campaign in Spain, 
where the weather is so exceedingly hot there 's 
no wearing their heavy regimentals — think of 
that!" 

" It is certainly the interest, as well as the 
duty of the nobility and gentry of Ireland to 
support this lady's society," predicated Lord 
OfTally. 

*' One of the means of doing permanent good 
must arise from it," assented Lord Harmer. 



236 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

*' The dyers and bleachers brought up under 
its care may be taught the value of the common 
materials they use," said Lord Horsemantown. 

" Others of your newly acquired friends of 
this evening have made their terms as well as 
Captain Flood," observed Mr. Priestly. 

" Oh, we recollect all that," replied Miss 
Flint, " only, for our lives, we must not fright- 
en the poor Irish with it yet, Mr. Priestly : one 
thing at a time, you know ; when we make them 
industrious, and self-respecting, and self-sup- 
porting, and tidy, and well-dressed, and self- 
reflecting, and all their cabins white-washed 
for you, — think of that — then you and Lord 
Harmer, and the Education Societies, and the 
Tract Societies, j ust step in, you know, and the 
good work is done." 

" One of your proposed objects is * to en- 
courage the poor to send their children to 
school,' " resumed Mr. Priestly, " and so much 
being openly professed, and known to be so, by 
the people, surely you can in the meantime 
further promote the arrival of the happy sea- 
son you anticipate. Miss Flint, by arranging 
that the children shall be sent to the proper 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 237 

school-houses ; to those where they can hear 
the words of the book of life." 

" To no other must they be sent," said Lady 
Cox. 

" Make it an indispensable proviso to our 
assisting their children or themselves," advised 
Mrs. Sparrow. 

"No, no," demurred Miss De Vere; "from 
what I have heard of the Irish peasantry, and 
poor of every description, that would, at the 
present time at least, deprive us of all oppor- 
tunity of improving them in any way." 

" I cannot, upon strictly conscientious 
grounds, recommend disguised measures any 
longer," urged Mr. Priestly. 

" And yet, we that know the characters and 
situation of the Irish, from constantly going 
amongst them, would still recommend a post- 
ponement of all professed views of changing 
their religion, while we teach them not to 
starve," said Lady Offally. 

" But I am sure your Ladyship has not for- 
gotten the advice of Mr. Boanerges, a few days 
ago," continued Mr. Priestly. 

" I have not, indeed, Sir." 



238 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

"Who that has the future interests of the 
unhappy people at heart, can forget it," said 
the Lady AngeHca Hunt : " brilliant creature ! 
no zeal was ever more pure or delightful than 
his." 

" Oh, were you there, Mr. Blount .''" eagerly 
asked Miss Flint. 

" Where, madam ?" 

" At the meeting where he spoke that speech, 
to be sure ! oh, I will never forget it ! After 
fully impressing us with the necessity for ba- 
nishing the cloud of scriptural ignorance that 
overshadows wretched Ireland — ' With my 
exhortations and my morning and my nightly 
prayers,' continued the divine man, * I have, 
at present little aid to aiford you ; gold or 
silver is not in my purse ; here, notwithstand- 
ing, here is the dying gift of an only and heart- 
loved brother, sent to me across the wide At- 
lantic — ' at this moment, Mr. Blount, the dear 
Mr. Boanerges pulled out — " 

Miss Flint's utterance became impeded. 

*' Some valuable trinket ^"^ asked Gerald. 

" His poor brother's watch. Sir !" answered 
Miss Flint, bursting into tears, and then re- 
lieved, went on : * Take it, my Lord,' he said, 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 239 

addressing the chairman, ' take it and keep it, 
until Heaven gives me the means of releasing 
it ; and those means may, I hope, soon accrue, 
from'—" 

" From what, madam ?" again inquired Ge- 
rald, as the fair and faithful reporter again 
paused. 

" ' From the sale of my last volume of ser- 
mons, published by Mr. Type of Cornhill, my 
Lord !'" sobbed Miss Flint. 

« Indeed !" cried Gerald. 

" Oh Mr. Blount, have you got a copy ? I 
have, we all have ; the carriages drove straight 
from the meeting to the pubhsher's, and, by 
this time, they are printing a second edition." 

" We mark you down as one of us, Mr. 
Blount .?" asked Lady OfFally. 

" By all means, Madam ; any object propos- 
ed by such advocates must be noble, indeed, 
and any connexion with it, an honour. But may 
I inquire, more particularly, into the nature 
of that object ?" 

" Our ultimate view and hope is, that the 
impulse we propose to give to industry and 
good order among the poor of Ireland, will 
have prepared many hands for co-operating 



240 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

with manufacturers, of great English capital, 
who may hereafter fix themselves in that coun- 
try." 

" An extended view, indeed." 

** It has been said," remarked Miss De Vera, 
anticipating, perhaps, one of her reports for the 
next full meeting of the society, — * that the 
disease of Ireland is too deeply rooted to be cured 
by any thing short of great measures ; and that 
industry and tranquillity can only be produced by 
a great influx of capital.' This is probably true 
as a general observation ; but we would humbly 
hope that the exhibitions of increased local 
comfort which our associations present, may 
induce capitalists to follow up the task of which 
we have made a beginning ; and that, in a few 
more years, commercial improvements may thus 
be spread over the whole country." 

Gerald, while in some manly supercilious- 
ness he felt inclined to smile at this new 
scheme, projected by lady-philosophers and 
philanthropists, to work, " in a few years," 
the complete regeneration of Ireland, did not 
hesitate to admit, allowing for the pretty little 
prattle of the " ultimate view," that conside- 
rable social and domestic good might follow a 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 241-2 

rational perseverance in any plan that sought to 
make the Irish people more comfortable. 

" In fact," he argued, " this, along with 
other efforts, may help to assimilate them 
to MS." Gerald never forgot his favourite 
theory. 

"Our dear Lady Eleanor Hope enters the 
room, and will assist us to instruct you," said 
Miss Flint. " See, Mr. Blount, — the pale, the 
very pale, the very young, and (some say) very 
interesting creature, now nodding to Lady Kil- 
bane, — with the clumsy red turban, — ay, I 
declare, and leaning on her husband's arm, too 
— think of that match, Mr. Blount! — she in 
her first teens, and he fifty — ^but such a lively, 
elderly good creature ! so funny ! and so active, 
for his age ! — hops about hec, sometimes, at 
home with his foot in his hand, instead of at- 
tending to the quadrilles she tries to teach him ; 
and is such a clever mimic ! — with his face, 
merely, I mean, for he never talks people,, only 
takes their pictures, as he says — and it is as 
sure as that you and 1 are speaking here toge- 
ther," — (" Then how dubious it must be, what- 
ever it is," thought Gerald, *' when the lady

243-4 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

has the whole colloquy to herself) — *' that 
he certainly can change his face— eyes, nose, and 
mouth, and all, into every other body's face he 
has ever seen once — and chatters so much to us, 
women, from the youngest, up — ay, and so well 
too, (and is such a healthy man, of his years ; 
they say, tourists always are more hardy, and 
last longer than your stay-at-homes) — that, I de- 
clare, we all patronize him. But just look at 
the fright of a red turban ! and poor Lady 
Eleanor''s poor white face under it ! — Ah !"-^as 
Lady Eleanor and her husband drew near — 
" Ah, dear friend ! how happy to see you ! how 
beautiful you look ! and your beautiful turban ! 
— Mr. Hope, you make a fool of yourself—" as the 
humoursorae gentleman proposed some grimace 
so close to Miss Flint's face, that no one else could 
take notice — " and 'tis a shame for you, a man 
of sense, and no boy, like you — go, go play 
your pranks somewhere else, and let your poor 
little wife, she looks so tired, sit down here with 
me, there — go ; dear Lady El. !" 

Not hesitating to adopt Miss Flint's good 
advice, Mr. Hope, with another imitative 
grimace at his exit, quickly went to play 



THE ANGLO IRISH. * 

his pranks somewhere else ; and that somewhere 
was, to Gerald's watchful eye, at that side of 
Miss Roper's chair left unoccupied by Captain 
Flood. Neither did it escape Gerald that, while 
showing, or studying to show, in her manner, 
the utmost innocence of the event, Miss Roper 
had not remained ignorant of Mr. Hope's pre- 
sence with his lady in the room. As they nodded 
to their hostess, and many around her, one glance 
of the young lady's eye towards the door, which, 
by the way, she had been glancing at all the 
evening, brought her the intelligence, and with 
it brought a superlative crimson — her girlish 
cheeks were always blooming — over her face and 
neck ; the next instant succeeded a hue more 
subdued than her usual colour; and though she 
continued to play her cards without embarrass- 
ment, and laughed at Flood's lispings, and, 
above all, ventured no second glance around, 
still, to any one who observed her as Gerald 
did. Miss Roper's well assumed unconscious- 
ness, was consciousness of a peculiar kind. 

Lady Eleanor soon became aware of the sub- 
ject that had been in discussion in her coterie 
before she came up, and now, with a very sincere 
vivacity, led the way in resuming it. 

" My only present misgiving," said Gerald, 



246 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

after he had listened to additional details of 
views and theories, from her ladyship and 
others, " is that you will not find the people of 
the country instructable or manageable ; and 
that they want principles of honesty and moral- 
ity to deal fairly with you, and feelings even to 
give you credit for good intentions." 

" Pardon us," said Lady Eleanor ; " mise- 
rable, most miserable, as is the condition of the 
poor Irish, we have found them all you sup- 
pose they are not. After lives spent in idle- 
ness that, of itself, could not help itself — I speak 
of the elders or matrons of families — we have 
found it, very generally, most easy to teach 
them habits of devoted and delighted industry ; 
after having all their lives been contented in 
rags and, of course, want of cleanliness, we 
have found it just as easy to give them the 
wish and the pride of clothing themselves tidily. 
In repaying our little loans, honesty, — I may 
say, honour — of the most scrupulous kind has 
marked their conduct ; and, as for feelings 
of gratitude, nay, of the tenderest affection for 
our efforts, I do believe no portion of Heaven's 
creatures can surpass them, there." 

** Your ladyship delights me, by proving me 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 247 

SO ignorant," said Gerald, really pleased at — it 
must not be said this justification of his parent 
country — but rather at finding proved such 
facilities for making the Irish — English. 

" As Secretary to the London Committee," 
said Miss De Vere amiably, yet not without a 
little official importance ; " I can verify Lady 
Eleanor's words." 

" And I," said Miss Flint ; " as Secretary to 
the principal Association in Ireland." 

" I mean, I can give you documental proof, 
Sir," continued Miss De Vere. 

" And I," contended Miss Flint. 

" From Clare, our correspondent informs us," 
pursued Miss De Vere, taking a paper out of 
her bag, " that when the institution at Clack- 
ma-cross was opened, ten women could not be 
found capable of doing the kind of work re- 
quired ; and in the course of seven months 
nearly two hundred were capable. Remark, 
too, that the neatness with which the articles 
are executed, such as lace, baby-linen, straw- 
platting, is the more praise-worthy, as it is 
done by the women in the evenings, after they 
return from labouring in the fields." 

" In the parish of St. Bridget, in the town of 



248 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

Kilvogan," read Miss Flint, in emulative flurry, 
out of her official paper, too, '* forty-six poor 
women gain a livelihood by a loan of from five 
shillings to ten shillings each ; and the following 
are their occupations : — 

" ' Ten deal in vegetables ; six in fruit ; eight 
in poultry ; eight in fish ; six in hardware ; two 
in fuel; and six in offal T Think of that!" 
concllided the zealous and precise Secretary, 
with a little triumphant flourish of her elaborate 
document. 

" Loans of five shillings to reclaim Ireland !" 
cogitated Gerald. 

* ** A solitary instance occurred, during the 
whole of last year, in Cork, of a poor man who 
received a loan absconding after only paying 
part of it," continued the more considerable 
officer, still reading ; " and the circumstance was 
no sooner made known to the poor people resid- 
ing in his district, than they proposed entering 
into a subscription of sixpence each to pay the 
deficit ; so anxious did they feel that the visit- 
ing lady should not suff*er by the dishonesty of 
any one amongst them." 

** A poor woman," rapidly resumed Miss 



THE ANGLO.IRISH*fc 249 

Flint, " applied to us*' — {my present corre- 
spondent writes from Galway) — " and received 
from our re-productive fund a loan, which she 
expended in the purchase of wool. Before the 
spinning was finished, a fever broke out in her 
family, eight of whom were successively attacked 
by it, and her industry became, of course, inter- 
rupted, and she had not the means of subsist- 
ence. While one day bemoaning her distress, 
the ball of yarn, that hung from the roof of her 
cabin, caught her eye ; and then she looked on 
the sufferers around her. The struggle was se- 
vere, but her better feelings prevailed, and she 
was heard to exclaim, in her own expressive 
language, * No — no distress shall make me do 
that; it is a sacred trust' — There!" appealed 
Miss Flint, touching with ridicule — by her 
mouthy and affectedly pathetic manner of read- 
ing a really interesting fact — the natural impres- 
sion of this little anecdote. 

" The question of honesty I admit to be set- 
tled," said Gerald. 

" It might allow of a hundred other proofs," 
said Lady Eleanor ; " but does not its proof in- 
clude the proof of industry also ^"^ 
M 5 



250 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

*' Indeed the following extract,*' resumed 
Miss De Vere, " does away with Mr. Blount's 
three objections together." 

" ' We are encouraged in our exertions by the 
good disposition, punctuality, and gratitude of 
the poor whom we have assisted ; and it is most 
pleasing to us, that during three years we have 
been associated, we have not had a single in- 
stance of dishonesty ."' " 

** At Kinsale," paralleled Miss Flint, " tw^elve 
pounds are turned five times in the year; and 
some women, who trade to Cork with salt her- 
rings, have turned five shillings seven times in 
the year, and supported their families — think 
of that !" 

" Last spring," resumed Lady Eleanor, 
" when my children lay ill of typhus fever, the 
peasantry I had now and then tried to assist, 
continually surrounded my door, in defiance of 
infection, with expressions of the tenderest sym- 
pathy, bringing little offerings of whatever 
might be acceptable, which the poor creatures 
had gone a circuit of ten miles to procure, and 
for which nothing could induce them to take 
payment.""' 

** That is a proof of good feeling, honourable 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 251 

to the most civilized country," said Gerald, 
touched to the quick, and perhaps, less than 
ever ashamed of Ireland. " But," he conti- 
nued, after a pause, " why should they not 
accept payment ? The compliment they wished 
to confer was of a pecuniary nature, after all ; 
and their pretension to confer such a one seems 
absurd, and shows them wholly destitute of any 
notions of the order and proprieties of social life." 

" You did not require a proof of their know- 
ledge of the world, you know," observed Lady 
Eleanor. 

" Your ladyship is right ; I was. indeed hy- 
percritical; now, however, I have only to ex- 
press my strong hope that Irish noblemen and 
gentlemen will fully see the claim upon them 
of seconding the exertions of your most useful 
society." 

" And yet," resumed Miss Secretary De 
Vere, again seeming to anticipate a forth-com- 
ing " Report," — " in reviewing the returns from 
Ireland, the committee have frequently found 
reason to regret the diminution and small a- 
mount of the local subscriptions." 

'* The want of resident landlords is, in this 
case, as in others, severely felt," remarked 



252 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

Lord OfFally, who from a late break in his in- 
come, had been compelled to live a great deal 
at home. 

*' I know a very clever Scotch gentleman who 
says it has been found out that non-resident 
landlords cause no injury in any case to a 
country," said Gerald. 

" He is right," assented Lady Angelica 
Hunt, whose husband was son and heir to an 
old nobleman, who drew thirty thousand a year 
from Ireland, and spent his life (I do not add 
his money, for his lordship had a twitch of the 
" old-gentlemanly vice,") in Hanover Square, 
or in different seats through England ; as to 
the honourable Everard Hunt, he never went to 
Ireland, and, on all possible occasions, public 
and private, called himself an Englishman ; 
" he is right ; for it is not required that a noble- 
man or gentleman shall live out of the extreme 
range of fashion, and of intellectual display, of 
every kind, in order to subscribe, liberally, to 
the wants of this or any other charitable so- 
ciety." 

•* So we think," said Miss Flint, spitefully ; 
" and if they only would remember the truth 
of your ladyship"'s remark, our Irish contribu- 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 2-53 

tion to the general fund would be more credit- 
able to us ally and we might not be ashamed of 
our homely Irish fashions, and displays of in- 
tellect either — think of that, now !" 

" What is your last Report from Mayo, Miss 
De Vere?" asked Mr. Priestly, knowing well 
what it was, as one of his own friends had 
helped to supply it. 

" While I regret to say," answered the fair 
secretary, " that it is not of a pleasing descrip- 
tion, I am anxious to add that it is the only one 
of its kind sent in from any part of Ireland." 

" Such as it is, allow us, if you please, to 
hear it." 

" In answer to the query ,** again read Miss 
De Vere — " ' what are the local circumstances 
which retard the progress of the association ?* 
this grievous list has been returned. * Dis- 
honesty, long-confirmed habits of idleness, 
anxiety for gifts, disrelish to return loans of 
any description, and mendicant habits, and su- 
perstition.' ■" 

" Ay," resumed Mr. Priestly, " supersti- 
tion ; say superstition, in one word, and you 
have said all." 

" All," echoed Lord Harmer. 



954 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" All," reiterated — each in his peculiar brogue 
— Mr. Loupe, and Mr. Cornelius O'Hanlon, 
who had just joined the circle. 

And " all," agreed Lady Kilbane, with a 
hot fatigued sigh, and a heaving of a portion of 
her vast though fine figure, as, snatching a 
moment from her card-tables, she also came up. 

And, " all, indeed," still assented Lady Cox, 
sighing profoundly too, in zealous yearnings, 
exactly as Gerald's eye happened to be fixed 
on her fine features. 

" Let my sincerity and my duty be an 
excuse for my repetitions," continued Mr. 
Priestly, " when I do repeat that until this 
society, as well as every other society establish- 
ed for the benefit of the Irish, boldly and open- 
ly fights with us against the superstitions of 
the country, no good can be done ; no good 
ought to be done." 

*' The poor cratures of mi/ poor country 
are hungry and thirsty for the word, and crying 
out for the word, and hunting out the word, 
through holes and corners," declaimed Mr, 
CHanlon — " give the poor cratures of my 
poor country the word, and they will ask you 
for nothing else but the word." 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 255 

" You amazingly valuable creature !" — lisped 
Flood, loud enough to be heard by all, though 
he particularly spoke for the amusement of 
Miss Roper, who, observing the juncture of 
O'Hanlon and Loupe with the circle, had, with 
suppressed titters, and signs of anticipating de- 
light, induced the dandy and her other at- 
tendant, Mr. Hope, to approach its outskirts. 
And at the same time that honest Mr. Cornelius 
made his speech, the latter mentioned gentle- 
man also ministered to her enjoyments ; for, 
after studiously confronting the Kerry orator, 
he then stood at his back, and gave an imitation 
of his face, almost of his features, so convincing, 
though so exaggerated, that happy Miss Roper 
had nearly committed the sin of laughing out- 
right. 

" I will go amonsht dem, and I will preash 
amonsht dem, and I vill thereby shee conver- 
sions amonsht dem, and the vorld vill shee con- 
versions," promised Mr. Loupe, taking up Mr. 
O'Hanlon, " and de vord shall be theirs, and 
dwell amonsht dem : I vill tell dem of my 
sojourning in de holiest chitty, and round about 
by de vaters of de Dead Shea, and round about 
de holy mountain, and on de top of de same, 



256 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

and in de holy valleys and holy places, and of 
de hopes dat vere born of my preashing and 
teashing, in every place, to de poor followers of 
de superstition of Rome ; and den, dey also shall 
believe ; for de people of Ireland are people 
ve have reashon to hope veil of, and many com- 
ing out from dem, over de vaters, to dis land, 
are good in de sight of good men." 

" You flatter," said Flood, now selecting Mr. 
Loupe for the scrutiny of his quizzing-glass ; 
and again Mr. Hope produced an imitation. 

" Gunning has made a hit," was Gerald's 
thought, as he watched the faces of Loupe and 
Lady Kilbane, during the last sentence of the 
little sermon. 

" How sad Lady Cox looks," he said the next 
moment, turning aside to Miss Flint, tired of 
the scene which still went on. . ' 

" Ah, don't you know why .?" the question, 
or something very like it, which Gerald had ex- 
pected to provoke. 

*' No ; I am only struck with her Ladyship's 
abstracted and unusual manner." 

" Think of that ! Not know what all the 
world knows ? Why, they 're in pieces !" 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 257 

" Who ? how ? what does your expression 
mean ?" 

" Broke — done up — she has cut him !" 

" Indeed ! so soon ?" 

" And in high time, I assure you ; people 
begin to think the poor little soul never cared for 
him ; only, when her mamma gave one roar and 
one stamp of her foot, (she wears Wellingtons, 
heel-shod with copper, all the morning, and 
something else to match, folks will have it — the 
Archdeacon is such a gentle good little soul of a 
dear man — hi, hi ! — think of that !) and my poor 
child, Louisa, not knowing her own mind — how 
could she at her years ? — but these childish mar- 
riages do lead to such sad doings — why shouldn't 
they? — she just did as she was bid, and had 
him, and then " 

" Well, Miss Flint, and then ?" asked Ge- 
rald, smiling at the energy of the narrator. 

" Why, then she found him out, a little too 
late ; she found that the horses in his stables were 
attended to more than she was ; that a day's 
hunting, thirty miles away from her, was much 
dearer to him than the sweetest delights of 
home ; and a night's carousing with his field- 



258 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

companions more prized than — she couldn't get 
her sleep for them !" continued Miss Flint, in- 
dignantly checking herself; " their tantivies 
and their chorusings used to invade the dear 
creature's chamber, eight rooms off ! And at 
first she never repined; but sought — " (with 
pathos) — " sought, in religious consolation, a 
balm for her bleeding heart. Do you know 
what ?" again becoming familiar ; " it was not 
till the other day when, set mad by a mere word 
of expostulation from her, he raised his whip — " 

" Vulgar scoundrel !"" muttered Gerald, as his 
eye glanced towards the object of his sympathy, 
and found in her soft and fascinating form, and 
youthful beauty, as well as in the youthful 
wretchedness (half a display as it was) of her 
airs, nothing but what wooed the gentlest ca- 
resses of a husband or a man. 

" Actually raised it," continued Miss Flint ; 
" it was not till then the dear sufferer thought 
of protecting herself; — not, indeed, by the in- 
terference of friends, or by legal proceedings; 
but, no longer finding safety under his roof, 
and, though they have been married a year 
or more, not being attached to his house by the 
tender maternal tie — think of that ! — she watch- 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 259 

ed her opportunity to escape from the country 
to Dublin ; and her mamma, whom she hoped 
to meet there, having come over here — why 
here she is now, by her side — only three days 
arrived, and the most miserable of women, as 
you see — think of that 1" 

In a few minutes after he received this little 
history, Gerald was standing, unseen by her, 
over Lady Cox. She sighed dolorously. An 
answering sigh escaped him. She indolently 
raised her head and caught his eye, and they 
gazed too long at each other. 

*' May I crave the honour of leading you to 
supper .?" he asked, taking a place by her side. 

" We don't stay for supper," she answered, in 
accents still sad, but perilously soft ; " mamma 
won't have me stay ; and indeed I would not 
have myself stay/' 

" You are so tired of us,'' said Gerald. 

*' Not of all of you" — and this, with a sudden 
look up, was spoken in an echo of her former 
brilliant tones. 

" Shawls, Louisa," said her abrupt mother. 

Both started. 

" I can at least order your carriage," prayed 
Gerald. 



260 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" Mamma, Mr. Blount orders the carriage," 
replied Lady Cox. 

After Gerald had conducted both down stairs, 
Mrs. Sparrow returned to speak a word to Lady 
Kilbane, and he and Lady Cox awaited her at 
the door of a room of the hall. 

*' Shall you be at home to-morrow ?'' he in- 
quired. 

" To-morrow, at two o'clock," she answered, 
laying some emphasis on the last words, " I 
accompany Lord and Lady Offally to a sermon 
at the chapel." 

" I will go too," said Gerald. 

" Then I will ask a seat in their carriage for 
you." 

" Thanks" — they paused ; a foot came down 
stairs — " 'tis Mrs. Sparrow," he resumed— 
" Good night !" — he extended his arm, while his 
eyes rested on hers. 

" Good night !" — she slowly gave her hand. 
He held it a second longer than it was necessary, 
and that second increased the danger of both. 
There was a pressure — at least on Gerald's part 
— and both again sighed. Gerald had an im- 
pulse to raise the beautiful hand to his lips. 
A stir in the room, at their backs, made him 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 261 

turn round his head, and at the remote end 
of the apartment he caught a glimpse, unno- 
ticed by them, of Mr. Hope and Miss Roper, 
enacting something very like the scene he was 
beginning with Lady Cox. He remembered 
that, like himself too, Mr. Hope had, a few mo- 
ments before he led down Mrs. Sparrow and her 
enchanting daughter, assisted Colonel Roper in 
conveying Miss Roper to her carriage ; and in- 
deed, the carriage was visible through the open 
door of the hall, the old gentleman waiting in 
it, while the young lady just tripped back with 
Mr. Hope to look for a light shawl. Error is 
never so well warned and startled as when sud- 
denly presented with an image of itself. Gerald 
could not press his lips to Lady Cox's wedded 
hand, while the lips of a wedded man were 
pressed to the hand of Miss Roper, so near him 
in the next room. He only repeated, " Good 
night !" and released it ; and at the end of the 
two little seconds during which all this hap- 
pened, Mrs. Sparrow joined them, and Lady 
Cox disappeared with her. 



262 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 



CHAPTER XII. 

This was not the first time that Gerald's 
heart had been touched, or that he thought so : 
indeed, many fair readers will suppose as much. 
And if I have not sooner detailed any of his 
love-scenes — (for the plural number is required) 
— I am prepared to state my reasons for the 
omission. 

Whether from nature or his studious habits, 
Gerald's ability for carrying on an affair of the 
heart had not, during his growth from sixteen 
to one-and-twenty, kept pace with the develope- 
ment, almost to maturity, of his other talents. 
He was now very nearly fit to cope, in any 
exertion of intellect, with men of double or 
treble his age ; yet not as fit to lay siege to the 
heart of an accomplished girl of seventeen. He 
would have felt self-possession at a cabinet 
council ; but not by the side of '' awful beauty," 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 263 

in a tete-£l-t6te. And owing to this want, or, 
let me be allowed to assert, (for he is my 
hero,) want of practice rather, Gerald, although 
full of susceptibilities of the most ardent as 
well as of the purest kind ; although, in the 
haunts of town fashion, as he walked or rode 
or drove along the very streets, a certain de- 
scription of eye could not beam from under a 
bonnet, or a certain description of lips — the 
rest of the features hidden — peep forth, when 
the bonnet was held down ; or a certain de- 
scription of ankle glance beneath a flounce, 
without making him sigh, either to know more 
of the amiable person to whom they belonged, 
or else at the thought that he was never to 
see her again ; nay, although, when in the ab- 
stractions of C'ambridge,

into consideration, Gerald never yet had had 
courage or tact enough to commence and 
carry on a love affair ; or else such love af- 
fairs as he did commence he never carried on ; 
or, worst of all, they were of that ridiculous 
kind, as regarded the suitableness of the ob- 
ject, which leaves me little inclination to reveal 
them to the criticism of, especially, my gentler 
readers. 

And in selecting, for my history, his new 
fascination with Lady Cox, very sincerely do I 
wish that the occasional practices of our fashion- 
able circles left questionable the taste with 
which, reasoning from the last sentence, I ap- 
pear logically to infer her ladyship's suitable- 
ness as Gerald's new object ; yet, believing 
that he will lose less of character by being 
shown in love with a married woman, his equal 
in society, than if he were boyishly to waste 
his raptures upon — (it was, however, twice the 
case,) — some fresh and blouzy rustic maiden, 
the piano-thrvimming and Lady of the Lake 
reading daughter of some sturdy farmer, I pro- 
ceed in my task, no matter with what regret 
at the very probability of being attended to. 

First then, upon going to rest, the night of 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. S.65 

Lady Kilbane's rout, Gerald resolved not to 
avail himself of Lady Cox's promise to bespeak 
him a seat for the sermon in Lord Offally's 
carriage. The next morning, at his toilet, he 
renewed, after some lapses, this good and valiant 
determination. He kept it up during break- 
fast ; nay, after breakfast called for pen and ink 
to write a line of apology, when, in answer 
to his ring, a servant appeared, bearing upon 
an embossed silver waiter a little three-cornered 
note. After examining the delicate running- 
hand of the superscription, and the sober de 
vice of the seal, Gerald read as follows : — 

*' Lady Cox presents her compliments to the 
Honourable Gerald Blount, and has the pleasure 
to say that Lady Offally will be happy to make 
the Honourable Gerald Blount one of her party 

to the sermon at chapel, at two o'clock 

to-day. Lady Cox would add that, from the 
known talent and zeal of the preacher, much 
desirable advantage to religious feeling may 
on this occasion be expected." 

" Staying away, after the trouble her I^ady- 
ship has been at, would be unseemly/* said 
Gerald. 

It was the first time he had heard a sermon 
»VOL. I. N 



266 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

in a dissenting chapel ; and while this one seem- 
ed not so proper or tasteful in language as 
those to which he had been accustomed, its 
energy and exciting power surprised him. He 
could observe, as he sat. Lady Cox's face, and 
upon her it had an extraordinary effect. At 
passages of different kinds she grew pale, or 
flushed, or, with unrestrained sighs, and some- 
times murmurs, wept profusely. 

The preacher was young, indeed very young 
for a preacher ; not more than nineteen or twen- 
ty ; and, Gerald had been given to understand, 
was one of those destined to preach the Gospel, 
at the next departure of Missionaries, to the 
savages of our remote colonies. Many of his 
allusions were to his proposed work, and, mixed 
up with a zealous egotism that was excusable, 
formed the most touching part of his discourse. 
He was, too, handsome as well as young ; and 
few ladies could hear him advert to the pathless 
jungles, only inhabited by tigers and boa-con- 
strictors, and to hundreds of miles of swamps, 
and to impassable rivers, as broad as some of 
our seas, and to the scorching terrors of the 
desert sun, without feeling for him, as well as 
for the subject he explained. In fact, the 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 267 

preacher proved as interesting as the sermon ; 
and Gerald was jealous of him when, after he 
had left the pulpit, he heard Lady Cox ask her 
friend Lady Offally, if any one knew any thing 
of him. 

He accepted a friendly invitation to meet 
Lady Cox that day at Lady Offally's. They 
sat together during dinner. Gerald, a little 
bored with incessant preaching, strove to divert 
Lady Cox into subjects he knew she had pre- 
viously liked to prattle on. With the exertion of 
a little ingenuity he succeeded ; and once more 
her charming eyes glowed or moistened at 
poetical allusions, or her voice murmured, or 
tears started, though not so profusely as at the 
sermon. 

" She is an exquisite compound of sensibi- 
lity," said Gerald ; " such a heart, and such 
talented apprehensions, too, might, if conge- 
nially and properly directed — assisted, I mean — 
have formed a character as superior as fascinat- 
ing. All this childish exaggeration might have 
become steady principle, or active intellect ; 
but now, while still almost a child, at the mercy 
of a bad husband and a maudlin sect — what a 
pity !" 

N 2 



268 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

After dinner, he accompanied her, and Lord 
and Lady OfFally, and other grave guests to 
evening devotions in the chapel they had that 
day visited. The scanty, pious hght of the 
place, the primitive service, the simple yet 
fervid union of the whole congregation, male 
and female, in singing the psalm, pleased Gerald 
as much as the sermon had surprised him. At 
the same time he felt that in no other situation 
can man and woman be more likely to imbibe 
those sentiments of admiration for each other, 
which, sons and daughters of Adam and Eve 
as we are, lead, no matter how commenced, to 
but one predicament of heart — mere heart. For 
when can lovely eyes look more lovely than in 
the meek up-turning of (let it be) the purest 
devotion ? or vermilion lips more delightful 
than in the gentle out-breathing of the psalm ? 
or an exquisite hand more exquisite than, in a 
sisterly assistance to piety, turning over, for a 
brother, the leaves of the psalm-book .'' 

While Gerald watched Lady Cox's eyes and 
lips in the occupations and expressions alluded 
to, I shall not even hint what unsaintly conclu- 
sions were wrought within him ; but when her 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 269 

hand, her fingers, sweetly and unconsciously 
touching his fingers, busied themselves, as has 
already been predicated, I admit that, first 
throwing a watchful glance around, he breathed 
a little sigh upon it ; and, so privileged are the 
attentions of the chapel, or so unconscious the 
holy calm it communicates, I also admit that 
his innocent incense was not rejected. 

Sir Archy instructively advises his son that, 
after trying all other places, he found Mrs. 
Mac in the Tabernacle. It was in her favourite 
chapel that, after the lapse of about a month, 
Gerald first felt sure, or very nearly sure, of 
I.ady Cox's love for him. The evening service 
was over ; the congregation, having been very 
numerous, took some time to go out, and Lady 
Coxa's party, sitting far from the door, remained 
in their pew until the passage should be clear. 
Lady Offally, who guarded Lady Cox's right 
hand, bent over a row of ladies before her, and 
began speaking with them. Gerald sat close 
at Lady Cox's left hand. Some of the lights 
had been extinguished, and what with the 
gliding of feet, and the rustling of those in mo- 
tion, and the decent and demure gossiping of 



270 THfi ANGLO-IRISH. 

those who could not stir, any two persons dis- 
posed for a tete-a-tete of a few minutes might, 
to a certain degree, enjoy it. 

" What a delicious quiet of soul," said Lady 
Cox, as usual rich in her language, " succeeds, 
even with the miserable, to the performance of 
religious duties." 

•' That ^ou can say so is pleasure to me," 
said Gerald. 

" Yes,'' with a tremulous sigh of praise ; " I 
know, at last, the value of my immortal spirit ; 
and that ought to recompense me for the loss 
of every earthly hope and joy." 

" Do you think the Giver of virtuous int- 
pulse to earthly happiness, and of facilities for 
its attainment, meant that it ought .''" asked 
Gerald. 

" No ; oh, no ! with my rebelHous heart con- 
vincing me of the contrary, I do not think so ; 
but for the wretch whom it has been Hi.s will 
first to form for earthly joy, and then to doom 
to earthly woe, religion produces consolation 
here, and rewarding raptures hereafter." 

" Your melancholy forebodings of a life of 
sorrow may not be well founded, and — permit 



THB ANGLO-IRISH. 271 

a devoted friend to add — ought not to be in- 
dulged." 

*' What do you mean ?" 
" The changes of youth cannot be foreseen. 
The miserable to-day may be the happy to- 
morrow ; and, alas ! the happy of to-day the 
miserable of to-morrow !" Gerald interrupted 
his syllogism with a selfish digression. 
" I admit it generally." 

" Even those," continued Gerald, less sel- 
fishly, " who, to-day, do not possess the qualifi- 
cations for making others happy — others, whose 
happiness depends on their making — may, by 
some natural alteration of character, possess 
such qualifications to-morrow." 

"But can those who, along with the want of 
qualifications, want the wish also, — do what you 
say? Can will be controlled.^ what's its master.?" 
" It has, indeed, no master," answered Ge- 
rald ; " and, I grant, cannot be controlled by 
its own possessor." He was again an egotist : 
" For will controlled ceases to be will, and the 
term passes to the controlling force, passion, 
impulse, or whatever it is to be called." 

" Then, Mr. Blount, for me life is hope- 



272 THE ANGLO-IRISH 

less indeed. The being who now wants the qua- 
lifications to make me happy, also wants the 
will ; and — "" she stopped and started as a stifled 
short laugh, or rather a kind of hystenc " ha !" 
sounded in a pew at their back. Both turned 
round ; but among the row of demure people, 
male and female, some whispering, and others 
silent, there to be seen, no face or eye fixed 
their notice. 

" Go on, go on,"' said Gerald. 

" Ob, Mr. Blount, why need I ; why should I 
go on ? and why should you ask me ? We have 
never before spoken openly on the subject ; but 
surely you cannot be Ignorant that you address 
yourself to a wretched woman, whose trusting 
heart — {trusting, at least, if truth permits no 
other term)" — the parenthesis was emphatically 
marked — " has been deceived, wronged, outrag- 
ed ; whose domestic attentions, if not her feel- 
ings'" — another emphasis — " have been flung 
back upon her, and whose lot in life is cast 
either for still experiencing this misery, or for 
solitary and wretched regrets, away from its 
actual presence.'" 

" Enchanting wretchedness !" faltered Ge- 
rald, taking the languid hand that rested on 



THE ANGLO-IRISH, 273 

the seat by his side ; and forgetful of the roof 
that covered him, Gerald felt one of those head- 
long impulses of strong affection that, for the 
sake of sharing the lot of a beloved object, would 
give up friends, fame, and country, and, if pos- 
sible, hurry her off to any remote solitude which 
the earth seems to reserve for such peculiar 
temptations. 

" Oh ! had it been my doom to have met, be- 
fore I met HIM, a different person !" continued 
Lady Cox, not withdrawing her hand. 

" You might have loved — and still, not 
worthiness" — said Gerald. 

" Impossible ?'' murmured Lady Cox. 

" How, impossible }" 

She was silent. He kindly and earnestly re- 
peated his question. She was silent still ; but, 
unhappy young lady ! she wept. The tears 
fell on their joined hands. 

" How ?" he asked a third time. 

*' I will — can — only say — impossible !" she at 
last answered ; and Gerald did feel a delicate 
return of the delicate pressure with which he 
had unconsciously eked out his last " how .'"' 

" Heavens!" starting up, as another strange 
though scarce audible " ha !" reached her ear ; 
N 5 



^4 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

" we are lost,'' she continued, dropping in her 
seat. " We ! oh I what have I said now ! and 
the moment before — what have I said !" she 
hid her face in her hands. 

*' Has any thing particular disturbed you ?"" 
he asked, not again selfish enough even to 
notice expressions that overpowered him with 
happiness. 

** Disturbed me .' particular !" repeated Lady 
Cox : " rise, and look, if you dare, at the last 
persons now in motion towards the door.** 

•' I see them," said Gerald calmly. 

"Observe one of them, then; the tall man, 
in Quaker-brown, with the broad-brimmed hat — 
his face t/ou cannot now see — ^his back is turned 
— is it not ?" 

« It is— what of him ?" 

^* He sat the whole evening behind us ; his 
head down, until that instant, when I sprang 
up." 

'« Well ?" 

*' But then / saw his face — and that man 
is my husband !" 

She was able to deliver the last words in a 
whisper; but no sooner had they been spoken, 
than they were followed by a shrill scream that 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 275 

terrified all in the chapel, and she lay senseless 
in Gerald's arms. 

Scarcely restored by Lady OfFally's salts, 
she was conveyed home by her alarmed pro- 
tectress. Gerald gave no explanation : Lady 
Cox continued, during their ride, too ill to be 
questioned, or, if questioned, to answer. She 
had the power, however, to whisper Gerald, 
as he assisted her down the step of the car- 
riage at her mother's door — " Not a word ! — 
and do not go yet." 

When, after Lady Cox had been led to her 
chamber, and Lady OfFally had taken her leave, 
Gerald remained alone with Mrs. Sparrow, he 
could not comprehend what the last injunction 
meant. He took advantage, however, of his 
situation, to learn, by indirect allusions, how, 
at or about the present moment. Sir Richard 
was, according to his mother-in-law's belief, 
occupying himself: and indeed, the motherly 
indignation of that lady, on the head of the 
treatment of her daughter, joined to her cha- 
racteristic abruptness, left Gerald no necessity, 
for all his purposes, to do any thing but allude. 
Besides, independent of his having been very 
friendly upon a former occasion in the family, his 



276 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

polite attentions, during the last month, seem- 
ed to entitle him to some confidence. 

Mrs. Sparrow, then, was sure that, at the 
very instant she was speaking — (it was about 
eleven o'clock at night) — Sir Richard Cox was 
either getting brutally intoxicated, at the head 
of a set of roaring fox-hunters, at his country- 
house in Ireland, or else engaged in other 
society, more degrading to him, and more 
dishonourable to her and her daughter. Since 
the arrival of his wife in England, he had, 
indeed, twice written to her and to Mrs. 
Sparrow, to command her home again ; but 
when the answers returned would agree to a 
re-union only upon an acknowledgment of 
lieavy crimes and offences on his part, accom- 
panied by the most solemn written promises of 
good conduct in future, Sir Richard became 
silent ; had never since made an application ; 
and, Mrs. Sparrow added, seemed to have come 
to a resolution to trouble himself no farther in 
the business. 

A modest double-knock at the hall-door 
disturbed the conversation, and a servant came 
up to say that Mr. Newbury, having heard of 
the illness of Lady Cox at chapel, had called. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 277 

late as it was, and offering excuses for his 
call, and a protest against intruding up-stairs, 
to inquire after her Ladyship's health. 

Now this Mr. Newbury was the unordained 
preacher whose eloquence had first attracted 
Lady Cox to the chapel ; and, it will be re- 
membered, Gerald had felt jealous of him on 
that very occasion, in consequence of Lady 
Cox's question to Lady Offally, " Does any 
body know any thing about him ?" Since 
then he had repeatedly met him in her com- 
pany at Lady Offally's, and, though Mrs. 
Sparrow ought to have acted more orthodoxi- 
cally, also ; in the house in which he at present 
sat, and whether over-sensitive jealousy, playing 
its proverbial fooleries, turned little nothings 
into expressive somethings, or that Mr. New- 
bury's manner really warranted his conclusions, 
Gerald continued to lay up in his breast ad- 
ditional suspicions of the handsome young 
preacher at least, if not of Lady Cox herself. 
More than once he had found them alone ; 
always, indeed, with the sacred book in their 
hands ; but once, when Gerald entered, rather 
suddenly, Mrs. Sparrow's drawing-room, they 
sat, he would venture to say, unnecessarily 



278 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

close, for a mere lecture ; and the pocket-bible 
having been hastily laid aside at his appear- 
ance, and also, being newly obtained from a 
distributing repository, the place they had been 
studying did not at once shut close, so that 
Gerald, as hastily taking it up, and opening it 
wide, at the same place, found this lecture to 
have turned upon the Song of Solomon. The 
present untiraed and officious call of the mis- 
sionary-elect, gave him, therefore, no pleasure. 

But he recollected Lady Cox''s delightful, 
though confused, and, he firmly believed, in- 
voluntary admissions to himself, an hour before, 
in the chapel, and doubt of her, at the least, 
vanished from his mind. He could then dwell on 
Mrs. Sparrow's assurances of the absence of Sir 
Richard Cox from England, supported as they 
were by his apparent indifference, during many 
weeks, to negotiate for a re-union with his Avife; 
and Gerald doubted if, in the person of the 
gravely-dressed, saintly-looking, and elderly- 
looking person, whose back, indeed, he had only 
observed. Lady Cox had really seen her youth- 
ful husband. 

But the question which at present most ab- 
sorbed him was, with what view had Lady 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 279 

Cox commanded him not immediately to retire 
from the house ? Did the words originate from 
any settled wish, or were they only the result 
of her agitated and incoherent state of mind ? 
or, supposing them to mean any thing, for how 
long a time were they to insure his attendance ? 
It was growing very late, and, without a seem- 
ing reason, how could Mrs. Sparrow explain his 
pertinacious tete-a-tete with herself.? Besides, 
Mrs. Sparrow evidently took it for granted that 
her daughter had retired for the night. 

While both now sat silent — " Hush !"" cried 
Mrs. Sparrow, " can it be possible ? What can 
she mean.'' or is the poor sufferer's head affected.?" 
a slow foot came down-stairs; and, an instant 
after. Lady Cox appeared at the drawing-room 
door, a chamber-light in her hand, and her face 
very pale, yet very composed, except that her 
black eyes glittered anxiously and wildly. Hav- 
ing looked forward, she stopped, her disengaged 
hand resting on the door-handle. 

" My child! Louisa! what means this.?" asked 
Mis. Sparrow, somewhat frightened. 

" Not yet alone. Mamma .?" said Lady Cox, 
in seeming surprise at Gerald's presence, which 
her hesitation at the door might also have ex- 



280 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

pressed; " I only came down, being quite re- 
covered, to speak a word with you."" 

" My appearance here certainly requires an 
apology," said Gerald, in a marked tone, as he 
arose to go away; now much embarrassed, whe- 
ther he considered the matter as a whim of Lady 
Cox, or inclined to account for her sudden en- 
trance as her mother had done. 

" No, do not be disturbed," resumed Lady 
Cox, advancing with an uneven step into the 
room, and holding a hand to her forehead, " not 
just this moment, at least; I thought I was 
quite well, yet now — " she sank in a chair 
— " Mamma, excuse me — but some Eau de Co- 
logne would soon revive me ; pray do not wait 
to ring." 

Mrs. Sparrow left the room. 

" And now," resumed Lady Cox, rising firmly, 
and with a sudden assumption of that perfect self- 
possession which women of every description of 
character, no matter how weak on former occa- 
sions, can, in her situation, or in similar ones, 
so surprisingly command : " Now, do not be- 
lieve my pretence ; I am perfectly recovered; I 
want no such aid as my Mamma goes for; I did 
not want it. Mark if circumstances do not make 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 281 

a quick scholar in the art of dissembling ; of 
insincerity ; of petty artifice. I wished you to 
remain here till I could say to you — I came 
down here to say to you — I equivocated and 
sent my mamma away to say to you — THIS. I 
have long understood you ; oh, that it had 
been but a little sooner ! My husband, to- 
night, has heard me confess I never loved him, 
and, at the least, could have loved you. No- 
thing but one course lies open to me ; therefore, 
and, as a first step upon it, we meet to-morrow 
morning, at six o'clock, to speak fully, in Ken- 
sington Gardens — farewell!" — She extended 
her hand ; as Gerald pressed it to his lips and 
bosom, the tears of a thousand contending 
emotions streamed upon it ; her cheeks were 
dry, and her eyes rounded and glowing. — 
" Farewell ; my mamma returns ; meet her at 
the door, and there say good night ; I would 
not have you once more witness my wretched 
dissimulation.'^ 



S82 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

Gerald went home to pass the first sleep- 
less night he had ever experienced ; the first 
wretched one, it may be added. For hours the 
new, the happy, and yet the terrible excitement 
of his situation deprived him of the power of 
thought. He still trembled, as when, meeting, 
according to Lady Cox's instructions, Mrs. 
Sparrow at the drawing-room door, he had 
hurriedly bid her farewell. Passionate tears 
relieved him, and they were followed by softer 
tears of tenderest pity for the youthful wretch- 
edness of the being he so fervently loved. 

Her sudden change of character, from lan- 
guor and childishness to the full force of woman- 
ly energy, then occurred to him ; and, glancing 
over the future fate it seemed to propose, nay, to 
command for her and for him, Gerald's feelings 
were those of consternation. Like many others, 
he had, up to this moment, absurdly, as well as 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 283 

wickedly, gone on towards but one conclusion ; 
yet, because that conclusion now appeared in 
view, he shrank from it. Nay, he tried to form 
excuses for himself, that pretended, though they 
dared not avow the pretence, to deny that he 
had ever so gone on at all. 

" I loved her, indeed, wildly loved her, 
from the first ; but if I recollect my own mind, 
never sought more than to share her society, 
and, by all allowable means, assuage the grief 
that weighed her down : — then her religious 
zeal was my farther security, though now she 
avows that she has long understood me. Could 
I think that, through a month of pious obser- 
vances, and, morning and evening, of the most 
glowing sentiments of devotion — she was engross- 
ed by other feelings.'' — Is it the nature of 
poor, weak, but dear, dear woman, to feed, in- 
differently, with virtuous aspirations, or with 
throbbings of a different kind, one life-long 
tendency of the heart ?— oh, I am taken by 
surprise, and the surprise is tremendous i" 

The sober, mental habits of his education, 
were, indeed, presented, in the latest conduct of 
Lady Cox, with, to them, a kind of scenic, 
overpowering energy, previously unsupposable. 



284 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

And here, for a second, was intruded an egotis- 
tical and, it may appear, unfeeling silliness ; yet 
those who are aware of the pervading power of 
a favourite theory, applied, since an early age, 
in some wa}' or other, to almost every new ac- 
cident in life, will perhaps account for his ab- 
surdity, if they cannot excuse it. " It is not 
English," said Gerald ; — " though claiming to 
he half English, I.ady Cox is Irish ; — in bring- 
ing-up, in mind and heart, — Irish ; — there was 
my mistake." 

But, above all he could devise to exculpate 
himself, even by criticising her, Gerald loved, 
adored : and the full influence of the sentiment 
soon returned, to sweep away every previous 
thought. And now, life spent with Lady Cox, 
a whole life, in solitude, became his only vision. 
She loved him ; she had " but one course" to 
take in consequence of loving him, and would 
he not take it with her ? would he not, rather, 
permit her to take it, since she could only do 
so hand in hand with him ? What was fame, 
what were court friends, what was accumulated 
fortune, compared with happiness .? His pre- 
sent fortune was limited, yet sufficient for in- 
dependence ; he would be hers eternally. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 285 

A posthumous letter, written to him by his 
mother, with instructions to his father and 
friends not to deliver it to Gerald till he should 
gain the age of sixteen, lay before him ; he had 
that day, been perusing it for the hundredth 
time. The late Lady Clangore was a woman 
of strong mind and observation, and the advice 
to her favourite son, contained in this epistle, 
while applying to every prominent error into 
which a youth may be supposed likely to fall, was 
penned in an impressive style. Amongst other 
hypothetic cases, that in which Gerald now 
stood, had naturally engaged the anxiety of the 
mother. He read and trembled once more. 
The voice of a parent speaking to him, as it 
were, from the grave, in the dead silence of 
night, and speaking, too, of all that forms the 
character of man — honour, religion, feeling, 
social rank, — this could not fail to produce al- 
most a petrifying eflPect. In fact, when, with- 
out having slept an hour, and after renewed 
struggles that compelled renewed and bitter 
tears, Gerald went out to keep his appointment, 
he had formed a manly and a noble resolution. 

He walked across Hyde Park, intending to 
enter the Gardens at the small door that nearly 



286 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

faces Knightsbridge barracks. Ere he passed 
quite in, a carriage and four drove furiously 
towards him, along the open road. Gerald 
glanced at it. A female attendant sat on the 
dickey, seemingly dressed for travelling. He 
looked more accurately and recognized Lady 
Cox's maid. The rapid associations produced 
by the discovery, startled — frightened him ; 
and he walked hastily into the Gardens, and 
proceeded, by the little mound, along the pri- 
vate path that leads into the more solitary 
regions of the fine pleasaunce. His first im- 
pulse was absolutely one of terrified avoidance. 
Even yet, he doubted himself; and from her 
presence, still arrayed in the charms that had 
captivated him, and made formidable by her 
new accession of character, his resolved heart 
turned away in fear. Then he recollected that 
this charming, wretched, and beloved object, 
came to tell him, to prove to him, how devoted- 
ly he was loved by her ; and Gerald's heart was 
no longer resolved, but yearned to turn to hers. 
I cannot, indeed, aver in what frame of mind 
he ftt last stood still at the outskirts of one of 
many clumps, or rather masses of trees, that 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 287 

nearly enclosed the most private spot in the 
Gardens. 

After the lapse of a few moments, a single 
figure appeared at a distance, moving along the 
path he had taken. In the firm step and self- 
possessed air it displayed, Gerald saw little of 
the former step and air of Lady Cox. As his 
eye remained fixed he ascertained, at a nearer 
view, that it was, however, no other than that 
ill-fated young lady : like her maid, she was 
clad for a journey. 

They met in silence. Their clasped hands 
only made a greeting. But in a few seconds 
Lady Cox spoke. " Your actions, and your 
words too, have, as I said before, long assured 
me you loved me ; but your more positive ex- 
pressions last night in the chapel left me no 
doubt.'' 

" Enchanting I^ouisa — I have loved beyond 
words or utterance — ay, since the very hour 
we met, though I dared not then admit it to 
my own heart."

from the very same hour, I loved, too. Do not

interrupt me — I have much to say ; — I ought to 
say much. But let me try to condense my words. 
The impression you made, at our first meeting, 
upon my very young and girlish heart, was 
not made because that heart was naturally light 
and fickle, or disposed to transfer its preference. 
Before it felt one for you, I became a wife at 
my mother's command, as I would have done- 
any other thing she commanded, which was not, 
or did not seem decidedly odious: and Sir 
Richard Cox was not old, nor deformed, and I 
knew nothing of him but what he looked. 
Another object called up the hitherto sleeping 
feelings he had failed to awaken ; and this, as I 
did not will or wish it, and as, up to that in- 
stant, a thought never strayed from my hus- 
band (he did not become or appear what he is 
till we returned to Ireland) — this, I say, was 
not my fault. 

" But though the involuntary sentiment could 
not make me guilty in its mere occurrence, I soon 
decided that its indulgence would : and, from 
the day that I entered my husband"'s house, my 
constant efforts were to forget you and esteem 
him. I must have been successful if he had 
assisted me. But he changed into a careless. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 289 

dissipated, bad, unfaithful husband ; coarse in 
his manners ; unintellectual in his thoughts ; 
gross in his errors ; and, at my least word of 
expostulation — (and believe me, my words 
were not many nor loud) — tyrannical, cruel, 
barbarous. I tried to make him love me again 
by the little attentions that he used to call en- 
dearments ; but my power was gone, my spell 
dissolved, my wand broken. I read to him, 
and he yawned and cried out * nonsense' on 
the book and me ; I sang and played to him, 
and he laughed and scoffed : and when, hiding 
my perhaps childish tears, I have stood up, and 
in poor smiles approached him, and put my 
wife's arms round his neck, and with my wife's 
lips offered to kiss his, he would — not gently — 
untwine my arms, avoid my kiss, and put me 
from his side. 

" I had been alone with him ; now, I was 
worse than completely alone ; and in this soli- 
tude, considering my years, my natural vivacity, 
my imperfect education, is it surprising, is it a 
proof of levity, that the thought once overcome 
should return upon me ? that I should remem- 
ber I had seen one, a little while too late, from 
whose conversation, talents, and turn of mind,

290 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

manner, sensibilities, and character, I might 
have hoped happiness ? in whose presence my 
song and my music, my book and my smile, 
would not pass as idle or tiresome ? and even 
if, in word or thought, pursuit or conduct, I 
had proved deficient, who must have been as 
anxious as he was highly quahfied to woo me 
into improvement, rather than to scofF or spurn 
me into despair ? — Do not speak yet, you think 
my words sound flatteringly, and call for pro- 
fessions : but pass that, and hear me still. 

" In the midst of my sufferings, an old lady, 
a relative of my mother, came to live in our 
neighbourhood, and from the first, I clung to 
her fellowship and sympathy. She was of a 
very pious cast, and, in her repeated conver- 
sations, could only propose to me the conso- 
lation of religion. Her language possessed a 
power and zeal which speedily moved me, and, 
in full sincerity of heart, I became her disciple. 
She introduced me to persons of her own ardent 
sect ; and, influenced, perhaps, as much by the 
novelty as by the truth of my feelings, I ima- 
gined that I had indeed found a partial cure 
for misery. 'Tis true, I never smiled in my 
new paradise ; and quite as true that two ob- 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 291 

jects, one celestial, and one earthly, almost 
divided my devotions. I cannot explain the 
seeming contradiction ; but it is certain that I 
never poured out my soul in sincere prayer and 
zeal, without loving you the more. 

" An extreme outrage drove me to London, 
and we met again. 'Tis useless to say how 
much your now perfected manner and education 
exalted you above even what I had recollected 
of you in my Irish solitude. But I will so- 
lemnly declare, that, until last night, notwith- 
standing our increased acquaintance, and my 
conviction that you loved me well, a thought of 
sharing life or fortune with you never occurred 
to my mind. I was only blessed in worshipping 
and praying by your side ; and in the reflec- 
tion, that even when deprived of that blessed- 
ness, I could remember it had been, and also 
remember that I was dear to you. 

" An instant of treacherous weakness betray- 
ed me into half of what I had resolved to die 
without saying ; and the appearance of my cruel 
husband involuntarily extorted a conclusive 

expression. It did more. It "" 

" Adored Louisa !" at last interrupted Gerald ; 
" might you not have been mistaken as to that 



292 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

person ? All probability is against his appear- 
ance in such a place, at the present time. Your 
mother thinks so.^ 

" What ! have you mentioned it to her !*' 
cried Lady Cox, in a sudden frenzy that startled 
Gerald, and gave him the first indication of 
the vehemence that lay only smothered in her 
bosom. 

" No," he answered, " not a word, not a 
breath — for worlds I could not have done so ; 
but, by other means, I induced her opinions of 
the great improbability of Sir Richard being 
now in London — and, indeed, his character and 
his silence, for many weeks, seem quite against 
the supposition." 

•* You do not know all his character. In the 
midst of dissipation, and of seeming carelessness 
of every thing on earth but his vulgar pleasures, 
he possesses a power of starting to his feet, 
sternly, if not calmly, and then of vigorously, 
if not properly, pursuing any plan of self-asser- 
tion he may, with or without cause, take into 
his head. From one or two unexpected ex- 
amples of what I say, I dread, as much as I 
abhor, my bad and tyrannous husband. Since 
I came to London, at least since his silence, after 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 293 

my mother's letter and mine, I have not been 
able to divest myself of the terrible notion that 
wherever I moved he was in my track, and his 
unseen eye always watching me. As to the 
possibility of my mistaking another face for his 
last night, that is out of the question. Oh ! the 
sufferer cannot so soon forget the features of 
the persecutor ! One glance at the brow of his 
former gaoler is enough for the escaped and 
trembling prisoner ! And though I hope he 
did not notice my recognition of him, for it 
was but a glance I had, and of his profile, too, 
and only half of thaty as he bent his head to his 
breast, yet ah ! — heaven of heavens !" 

Lady Cox screamed till the little soUtudes 
around rang to the piercing sounds, as, clasping 
her hands together, she looked up a vista of 
trees. 

" What ? what 's the matter ? " inquired 
Gerald. 

" Look ! look where I point, or he is gone I" 
Gerald, indeed, saw a man running fast, and just 
turning the edge of a thick clump, at about 
thirty yards distance. " 'Tis he again ! " she 
continued, " and he has, until this moment, 
been near enough to hear every thing we said !

Perhaps but hiding behind this very tree we 
lean against ! But he does not make me swoon 
now ! For now, indeed, my path is marked out; 
the path that bears me from him, from destruc- 
tion, death at his hand ! Oh ! he would no more 
pause to shed my blood, than he would hesitate 
to shed that of the poor bird his cruel pastime 
dooms to slaughter ! This morning, this instant, 
I leave London !" she advanced towards the 
entrance by which she had come into the Gar- 
dens, and continued to walk rapidly, Gerald 
following: — "London, England, Ireland, for- 
mer friends ! Him and the world !" 

" Compose yourself, for mercy's sake 1" cried 
Gerald, taking her hand, as they walked along, 
" be more collected — what do you mean ?" 

" And you ask me that ? " she exclaimed, 
dropping his hand : " you who have brought me 
to say it ! why are you here ? why are we here 
together ? If you could have interpreted, in a 
second sense, my parting words last night, the 
words that proposed this meeting, why did you 
listen to them ? why act on them ?" 

" Beloved Louisa, hear me : I did, indeed, 
give those dear words but one sense — ^a sense 
that intoxicated me with happiness, that made 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 295 

me at the moment, and afterwards in the soli- 
tude of my sleepless chamber, resolve to devote 
every hour, every day of my life, to your most 
honouring love and confidence ; yet, reflection — " 

" Reflection ! you can reflect at such a mo- 
ment ! in such a situation ! — you love, and you 
can reflect ! Let go my hand .' I spurn your 
calculating and cold conceit, as I loathe and fear 
him ! Restrain me not !" Gerald struggled to 
restrain her. " I can dare my fate alone !" 

" Louisa !" he flung himself on his knees, 
while mingled tears of pity and of contending 
passion burst forth — " let me speak on ! You 
ask me why I am here ! I answer, to say that 
which may restore — which — have mercy and 
hear me !" 

His voice failed, and his head sunk on his 
clasped hands. As sudden a change occurred 
in her emotions. After looking at him a mo- 
ment, she, too, wept, and also kneeling, al- 
lowed her arms to fall on his shoulders as she 
said, " Not to me, Gerald ! not this low atti- 
tude to me ! — not this bending to her whose 
almost idol you are ! That you love me as it 
is my pride and my joy to be loved, I now see ; 
and I could curse the tongue that has given

you one angry word ! Oh, Gerald, anger is 
new to me, as well as other things ! this is the 
first time in my life I have forgotten I was a 
lady, and that I should forget it to you, makes 
the thought sharp as a piercing sword. But I 
know not how it is,'' she continued, allowing 
him to raise her — " you have changed me, Ge- 
rald, into something I have no recollection I 
ever was ; and, be the change for good or ill, I 
am not the Louisa I have been. You have 
given me, along with strength — ay, daring of 
mind — a wish to think and to excel, which, T 
believe, was not born with me. Beloved Ge- 
rald, do not forsake me in the undetermined, 
undirected force of a new consciousness and 
character ! — send the freshly-burst stream upon 
an even course, lest it rush foaming over the 
precipice ! In my present utter misery, horror, 
and fear, do not cast me off ! This is not wo- 
man's usual language, but must not the loving, 
desolate, and terrified heart speak or break !" 
She again suddenly knelt. " Make of me what 
you will ! oh ! I will be endowed with a mind 
and a power to prove worthy of you ! And, 
were we away from imminent peril — time, a lit-

tie time, and the natural course of events, may 
allow us to remain together in admitted vir- 
tue r 

" Rise, if you would not make me mad, 
Louisa !" After many efforts, during which she 
almost laid her head at his feet, he once more 
raised her. " If I do not love, worship you, 
with heart, and soul, and if I would not che- 
rish you, with heart, and soul, and hand, against 
the world, let the power I invoke to decide, 
destroy me ere another word escapes ! But — " 

" That ends it !" she cried, relapsing into her 
wilder mood — " that one little breath ! — fare- 
well !" she moved from him more quickly than 
before. He still followed, but vainly sought to 
stay her — " I will take my revenge !" she added. 

Dreadful misgivings occurred to him. 

" Louisa ! adored ! what mean you ?" 

" You think I mean self-murder, but you 
err." 

" Oh, Louisa ! promise me that, faithfully 
and solemnly, if indeed you will not stay to 
give me a hearing." 

" Do not be alarmed, Sir !"" she answered, in 
a bitter and scoffing tone ; *' perhaps, after all. 



298 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

your superb disdain may not prove enough to 
kill a poor rejected lady; yet, expect to own 
me revenged, still." 

" Jeer me as you will, Louisa, but promise 
that your hasty thought suggests no violence of 
any kind to yourself or others !" 

" Others !" she laughed out : " why, you 
fear for yourself, now. But, farewell, I say, — 
you need not." 

She had approached within view of the door. 
All his virtuous resolutions tottered to their 
downfal. 

" Oh leave not London thus !" he cried — 
" alone, unprotected, helpless." 

" I mean it not. Sir;"" the distance increased 
between them ; he sprang after her — " or, take 
me with you !" he continued : " no matter what 
ties are broken, what principles violated, what 
results dared, let me share your precipitancy 
and your lot !" 

In unmixed pride she answered, " No, Sir ! 
you shall violate no principles for me, you shall 
gain no opportunity to reproach me with the 
precipitancy which, even in this moment of 
relapsing ardour, you can so coolly calculate. 
Release me, Sir, and do not presume to follow." 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 299 

She swept from him to the door and disap- 
peared through it. After a moment of stupor 
he ran on. The carriage was already out of 
hearing of the cries of " stop ! stop !" which he 
addressed to the coachman. Unconscious of 
the amazed and perhaps sneering observation of 
the garden-keeper who sat at the door, he fol- 
lowed in its track. But the horses went on at 
a gallop, and all his efforts even to keep the 
distance he first held from it were unavailing. 
He only had the consolation of observing that, 
after having gained the Hyde-park-corner en- 
trance, it turned to the left, up " the Ring," 
and whirled townwards through Grosvenor- 
gate. 

Arriving at home, exhausted with emotion, 
exertion, and want of sleep, he hurried to his 
chamber, and flung himself down. Nature 
asserted her right, and he slept profoundly. 

At about one o"'clock in the afternoon a 
servant awoke him by tapping at his door. He 
started up from dreamless slumber to a broken 
recollection of the morning, that more resem- 
bled, however, a hideous dream, or the calling 
back of one, than it did the realities of his ex- 
istence. The servant said that a gentleman. 



SOO THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

who had not the honour ctf being known to him. 
requested an interview on pressing business. 

He hastened, with ominous though vague 
expectations, to the parlour, and found in it a 
fashionable-looking young man, whom he cer- 
tainly had not before seen. The stranger bowed 
distantly, though pohtely ; and, when both were 
seated, began, by saying that he called on the 
part of his friend Captain Stanhope, of whom, 
perhaps, Mr. Blount had heard. 

" Yes," Gerald said ; " a distant relation, he 
believed, of — of Lady Cox ;" — (gulphing down 
half the words,) — " and her Ladyship had slight- 
ly spoken of young Captain Stanhope to him." 

'* And now. Sir,"" resumed the stranger, 
" Captain Stanhope would, through me, speak 
to you of her Ladyship." Gerald was much 
honoured, and all attention. 

" As the business is sudden, Mr. Blount, I 
fear I must be abrupt. The elopement of 
Lady Cox has just transpired." 

" Gracious Heaven, Sir !"" gasped Gerald. 

*' And," continued Captain Stanhope's friend, 
smiling, as if incredulously, at his ejaculation ; 
" as it is well known that you met her Ladyship 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 301 

alone, very early, this morning, in Kensington- 
gardens, Captain Stanhope requires an instan- 
taneous account of her place of retreat at your 
hands." 

Gerald protested his incompetency to supply 
any such account. He was amazed, distressed, 
thunder-struck ; but he knew no more of Lady 
Cox's elopement, until now communicated, than 
of what was passing in Nova-Zembla. 

" You met the lady this morning. Sir, clan- 
destinely." 

*' He had certainly happened to see Lady 
Cox that morning, but " 

*' Enough, Sir ! it is now my duty to hand 
you this." 

Gerald tore open a note and read — " Sir, 
supply the information required by my friend, 
or immediately arrange with my friend place 
and time, to satisfy me for your refusing to do 
so, or submit to be termed a dishonourable and 
dishonoured man. — R. Stanhope." 

Gerald was in a state of excitement ready to 
explode in any shape. Within three hours, 
accompanied by his old schoolfellow, Flood, he 
gave Captain Stanhope the required meeting. 

VOL. I. P 



302 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

They fired together ; both fell. Their surgeons 
reported that Gerald's wound was slight, Captain 
Stanhope's mortal. 

" Peace has been proclaimed at a monstrously 
convenient time for you, worthy Blount," said 
Flood, " inasmuch as this little aflPair gives 
you an opportunity to see la belle France ; 
and I am preposterously inclined to accompany 
you." 

In a stupor of emotions, Gerald, after his 
wound had been dressed, allowed Flood to help 
him into his carriage, and they were whirled, 
in a few minutes, towards the coast. 

He had just recovered, in Paris, from a short 
and not very violent fever, produced more by 
his astonishment and anxiety on account of Lady 
Cox's mysterious conduct, than by his wound, 
when the following explanation flung him back 
into an illness that brought him to the verge of 
the grave. It is condensed from Lord Clan- 
gore's letter, and other information. 

After Sir Richard Cox hurried out of Ken- 
sington-gardens, where, indeed, he had heard 
all that his wretched young wife had feared he 
had, he called upon his intimate friend young 
Stanhope, told him, for the first time, the his- 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 303 

tory of his own dishonour, and enjoining him 
to watch Gerald, proceeded to follow, with his 
own eye, the conduct of Lady Cox. From that 
time Stanhope lost sight of him; but when 
Louisa's elopement became known among her 
friends, Stanhope, though at a loss to account 
for the husband's disappearance also, resolved 
himself to call Gerald to account. 

But Sir Richard was fully occupied. He 
had ascertained, before his visit to Stanhope, 
that his wife and Gerald did not leave the Gar- 
dens together. He had tracked her carriage to 
the door of a rather obscure house near the 

chapel ; had seen her dismount, and 

go in ; left one of his spies to keep watch ; 
and not till then sought his military friend. 
Returning to his spy, he learned that a young 
gentleman, dressed in black, had, seemingly in 
much agitation, issued from the house with 
Lady Cox, handed her into her carriage, step- 
ped after her, and that they instantly drove off, 
in a direction which a second spy, dispatched 
for the purpose, would soon ascertain. — One re- 
trospect is here necessary. Gerald had been 
correct in suspecting the attentions of the young 
unordained preacher ; he had only not gone far 



304 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

enough. Taking advantage of Lady Cox's un- 
formed state of mind and feeling, of her devo- 
tional zeal, and of her deference to his talents, 
and, perhaps, though it did not amount to love, 
of her obvious personal interest in him, Mr, 
Newbury, indulging the impulses of a violent 
attachment, with which at a glance she had in- 
spired him, found opportunity to insinuate, in 
his mixed love of God and of his neighbour's 
wife, that, situated as she was, in the power of 
the bad and wicked man her husband, she could 
do nothing better calculated to promote the gene- 
ral good, her own earthly and future happiness^ 
and, withal, the happiness of a loving brother, 
than to forsake the t3rrant and tempter, who at 
once treated her cruelly, and might, at a future 
re-union, peril, by bad example, her immortal 
soul. But, rejecting at the time his eloquent 
and specious doctrine, Lady Cox afterwards en- 
tertained little partiality for the handsome young 
apostle, until, in a moment of frenzied fear of 
her husband, and of womanly indignation against 
Gerald, he occurred to her as her only present 
means of personal protection, and of the revenge 
she had promised Gerald to take, and which; 
by thus rushing from his arms to the arms of 



THE ANGLO-IRISH. 305 

another, she believed must be fully acknowledg- 
ed in the bitterness of his mortification. 

Sir Richard, though petrified at her sudden 
changing of lovers, lost not an instant in pur- 
suing her. It was enough for him that his 
wife had dishonoured him ; with whom, or why 
with this strange gallant instead of Gerald, 
though a question of great interest, he did not, 
in his present mood, care or condescend to de- 
bate. 

It formed no part of his terrible plan to over- 
take them on the road. As they halted, there- 
fore, he halted ; until, about four o'clock of a 
sunny day in May, he saw them put up at a 
hotel in Rye. Half an hour after, he dogged 
them to a ready-furnished solitary house in the 
suburbs of the town, upon which was the pla- 
card " To Let." He saw them go in, and 
Newbury returned alone to the hotel, but 
soon came back, superintending some luggage. 

Sir Richard, cursing the slow approach of 
night, still kept his eye fixed on the solitary 
house. At last the evening fell, and the win- 
dows of their sitting-room glowed with candle- 
light ; the linen blinds only had been drawn 
down. The shadows of their figures, passing 



306 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

backward and forward in the apartment, closely 
united, were caught on the blind. Sir Richard 
walked rapidly, but cautiously, to the kitchen, 
or back-door. 

He feared to have found it locked, so that he 
must have tapped, or made some noise, which 
it was not his object to do. But, gently raising 
a latch, he crossed the threshold and presented 
himself before the only attendant yet established 
in the house. Lady Cox''s own maid. 

" Not a word, or you die !" he said in a 
fierce whisper, drawing a pistol. She fell sense- 
less without screaming. He observed if the 
windows of a small back-kitchen were barred, 
and ascertaining that they were, he lifted her 
into the place ; locked the door ; sat down to a 
table ; took out a paper that afterwards was 
found to contain an account of his proceedings, 
continued from day to day since he arrived in 
London ; added to it, in pencil, a statement of 
the last circumstances here described, together 
with an avowal of what he yet resolved to do : 
folded it and put it in his bosom ; drew forth a 
second pistol, and snatching the servant's can- 
dle, stept softly up-stairs. 



THE ANGLO-IRISH-. 307 

He found the door of the sitting-room bolted 
against him ; perhaps they had heard his creep- 
ing footsteps, and secured it in terror. The 
crash of bursting it open recalled the girl below 
to her senses. She listened. Piercing screams 
succeeded. Then a shot ; a pause ; and then 
another shot. 

She could tell no more. But those who re- 
leased her in the morning from her fearful im- 
prisonment, learned, upon proceeding to search 
the house, the sequel of the story. Upon the 
middle of the floor lay Sir Richard Cox, dead 
and cold. At one side, near a sofa, were 
stretched Newbury and Lady Cox, bound to- 
gether with her own sash and shawl. At first 
the people thought that they, too, were both 
dead. But, to their horror. Lady Cox moved 
her head sideways, when she heard their ap- 
proach, and fixing her large dark eyes on them, 
smiled. Her companion was, indeed, lifeless 
and stiff; she was only mad : her husband had 
offered her no personal injury ; but, having 
shot her paramour through the heart, he bound 
her to the body, placed its arms round her neck, 
and demoniacally refining his revenge, preferred 



808 THE ANGLO-IRISH. 

to let her live, that she might see him die too, 
and then pass the night in the situation in 
which the people found her, and afterwards 
remember it if she could.
