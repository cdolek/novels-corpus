THE WONDROUS 



TALE OF ALROY. 



PART X.— (CONTINUED.) 

XL 

At the first streak of dawn the He- 
brew cavalry, with the exception of the 
guard, charged the advancing columns of 
the Karasmians with irresistible force, 
and cut them to pieces. Alp Arslan ral- 
lied his troops, and at length succeeded 
in forming his main body in good order.

THE WONDROUS TALE 



Alroy and Asriel led on their divisions, 
and the battle now became general. It 
raged for several hours, and was on both 
sides well maintained. The slaughter of 
the Karasmians was great, but their stern 
character and superior numbers counter- 
balanced for a time all the impetuosity 
of the Hebrews, and all the energy of 
their leaders. This day Alroy threw 
into shade all his former exploits. Twelve 
times he charged at the head of the Sa- 
cred Guard, and more than once pene- 
trated to the very pavilion of Alp Arslan. 
In vain he endeavoured singly, and 
hand to hand, to meet that famous chief- 
tain. Both monarchs fought in the 
ranks, and yet fate decided that their 
scimitars should never cross. Four hours 
before noon it was evident to Alroy, that 
unless Scherirah arrived, he could not 



OF ALROY. .5 

prevail against the vast superiority of 
numbers. He was obliged early to call 
his reserve into the field, and although 
the number of the slain on the side of 
Arslan exceeded any in the former vic- 
tories of the Hebrews, still the Karas- 
mians maintained an immense front, 
which was constantly supplied by fresh 
troops. Confident in his numbers, and 
aware of the weakness of his antagonists, 
Arslan contented himself with acting on 
the defensive, and wearying his assailants 
by resisting their terrible and repeated 
charge. 

For a moment, Alroy at the head of 
the Sacred Guard had withdrawn from 
the combat. Abner and Asriel still 
maintained the fight, and the Caliph was 
at the same time preparing for new 
efforts, and watching with anxiety the 



6 THE WONDROUS TALE 

arrival of Scherirah. In the fifth hour, 
from an eminence he marked with exul- 
tation the advancing banners of his ex- 
pected succours. Confident now that the 
day was won, he announced the exhila- 
rating intelligence to his soldiers ; and 
while they were excited by the animating 
intelligence, led them once more to the 
charge. It was irresistible ; Scherirah 
seemed to have arrived only for the pur- 
suit, only in time to complete the victory. 
What then was the horror, the conster- 
nation of Alroy, when Benaiah dashing 
up to him, informed him that the long- 
expected succours consisted of the united 
forces of Scherirah and Abidan, and had 
attacked him in the rear. Human genius 
could afford no resource. The exhausted 
Hebrews, whose energies had been racked 
to the utmost, were surrounded. The 



OF ALROY. 7 

Karasmians made a general and simul- 
taneous advance. In a few minutes the 
Hebrew army was disorganized. The 
stoutest warriors threw away their swords 
in despair. Every one thought only of 
self-preservation. Even Abner fled to- 
wards Hamadan. Asriel was slain. Al- 
roy, finding that it was all over, rushed 
to his pavilion at the head of about three 
hundred of the guards, seized the fainting 
Schirene, and threw her before him on his 
saddle, and cutting his way through all 
obstacles, dashed into the desart. 

For eight-and-forty hours they never 
stopped. Their band was soon reduced 
one-third. On the morning of the third 
day they dismounted and refreshed them- 
selves at a well. Half only regained their 
saddles. Schirene never spoke. On they 
rushed again, each hour losing some ex- 



8 THE WONDROUS TALE 

hausted co-mate. At length, on the fifth 
day, about eighty strong, they arrived at 
a grove of palm-trees. Here they dis- 
mounted. And Alroy took Schirene in 
his arms, and the shade seemed to revive 
her. She opened her eyes, and pressed 
his hand and smiled. He gathered her 
some dates, and she drank some water. 

"Our toils will soon be over, sweetest," 
he whispered to her ; " I have lost every 
thing but thee.'* 

Again they mounted, and proceeding 
at a less rapid pace, they arrived towards 
evening at the ruined city, whither Alroy 
all this time had been directing his course. 
Dashing down the great street, they 'at 
length entered the old amphitheatre. 
They dismounted. Alroy made a couch 
with their united cloaks for Schirene. 
Some collected fuel, great stores of which 



OF ALROY. 9 

was found, and lit large fires. Others, 
while it was yet light, chased the gazelles, 
and were sufficiently fortunate to provide 
their banquet, or fetched water from the 
well known to their leader. In an hour's 
time, clustering round their fires in 
groups, and sharing their rude fare, you 
might have deemed them, instead of the 
discomfited and luxurious guards of a 
mighty monarch, the accustomed tenants 
of this wild abode. 

'' Come, my lads," said Alroy, as he 
rubbed his hands over the ascending 
flame, " at any rate this is better than 
the desart !"

10 THE WONDROUS TALE 



XII. 

After all his exertions, Alroy fell into 
profound and dreamless sleep. When he 
awoke, the Sun had been long up, Schi- 
rene was still slumbering. He kissed 
her, and she opened her eyes and smiled. 

" You are now a bandit's bride," he 
said with a smile. " How like you our 
new life ?" 

" Well ! with thee." 

" Rest here, my sweetest; I must rouse 
our men, and see how fortune speeds.*' 
So saying, and tripping lightly over 
many a sleeping form, he touched 
Benaiah. 

'^ So ! my brave captain of the guard, 
still napping! Come! stir, stir." 



OF ALROY. 1 1 

Benaiah jumped up with a cheerful 
face. '' I am ever ready, Sire." 

" I know it ; but remember I am no 
more a king", only a co-mate. Away with 
me, and let us form some order." 

The companions quitted the amphi- 
theatre and reconnoitred the adjoining 
buildings. They found many stores, the 
remains of old days, mats, tents, and 
fuel, drinking-bowls, and other homely 
furniture. They fixed upon a building 
for their stable, and others for the ac- 
commodation of their band. They sum- 
moned their companions to the open place, 
the scene of Hassan Subah's fate, where 
Alroy addressed them and developed to 
them his plans. They were divided into 
companies ; each man had his allotted 
duty. Some were placed on guard at 
different parts ; some were sent out to 



12 THE WONDROUS TALE 

the chase, or to collect dates from the 
Oasis ; others led the horses to the con- 
tiguous pasture, or remained to complete 
their interior arrangements. The am- 
phitheatre was cleared out. A rude but 
convenient pavilion was formed for Schi- 
rene. They covered its ground with 
mats, and each emulated the other in his 
endeavours to study her accommodation. 
Her kind words and inspiring smiles ani- 
mated at the same time their zeal and 
their invention. 

They soon became accustomed to their 
rough but adventurous life. Its novelty 
pleased them, and the perpetual excite- 
ment of urgent necessity left them' no 
time to moura over their terrible vicissi- 
tudes. While Alroy lived, hope indeed 
never deserted their sanguine bosoms. 
And such was the influence of his genius. 



OF ALROY. 13 

that the most desponding felt that to be 
discomfited with him was preferable to 
conquest with another. They were a 
faithful and devoted band, and merry 
faces were not wanting when at night 
they assembled in the amphitheatre for 
their common meal. 

No sooner had Alroy completed his 
arrangements than he sent forth spies in 
all directions to procure intelligence, and 
especially to communicate, if possible, 
with Ithamar and Medad, provided they 
still survived and maintained themselves 
in any force. 

A fortnight passed away without the 
approach of any stranger ; at the end of 
which, there arrived four personages at 
their haunt, not very welcome to their 
chief, who, however, concealed his cha- 
grin at their appearance. These were 



14} THE WONDROUS TALE 

Kisloch the Kourd, and Calidas the In- 
dian, and their inseparable companions, 
the Guebre and the Negro. 



XIII. 

" Noble Captain," said Kisloch, " we 
trust that you will permit us to enlist 
in the band. This is not the first time 
we have served under your orders in this 
spot. Old co-mates i'faith, who have 
seen the best and the worst. We sus- 
pected where you might be found, al- 
though, thanks to the ever felicitous in- 
vention of man, it is generally received 
that you died in battle. I hope your 
Majesty is well," added Kisloch, bowing 
to Schirene. 

" You are very welcome, friends," re- 



OF ALROY, 15 

plied Alroy ; " I know your worth. You 
have seen, as you say, the best and the 
worst, and will, I trust, see better. Died 
in battle, eh ! — that's good !" 

" ''Tis so received," said Calidas. 

"- And what news of our friends ?" 

*' Not over good, but strange." 

" How so ?" 

" Hamadan is taken." 

" I am prepared ; tell me all." 

" Old Bostenay and the Lady Miriam 
are borne prisoners to Bagdad." 

'' Prisoners 1" 

" But so: all will be well with them, I 
trow. The Lord Honain is in high fa- 
vour with the conqueror, and will doubt- 
less protect them." 

" Honain in favour !" 

'' Even so. He made terms for the 
city, and right good ones." 



16 THE WONDROUS TALE 

** Hah ! he was ever dextrous. Well ! 
if he save my sister, I care not for his 
favour.'* 

" There is no doubt. All may yet be 
well, Sir." 

" Let us act, not hope. Where's 
Abner ?" 

" Dead." 

*' How ?" 

'^ In battle." 

" Art sure ?'' 

" I saw him fall, and fought beside 
him." 

" A soldier's death is all our fortune 
now. I am glad he was not captured. 
Where's Medad, Ithamar ?" 

" Fled into Egypt." 

'' We have no force whatever then ?" 

" None but your guards here." 



OF ALROY^. 17 

" They are strong enough to plunder 
a caravan. Honain, you say, in fa- 
vour ?" 

" Very high. He'll make good terms 
for us." 

" This is strange news.'* 

" Very, but true." 

" Well ! you are welcome ! Share our 
fare ; 'tis rough, and somewhat scanty ; 
but we have feasted, and may feast 
again. Fled into Egypt, eh ?" 

"Ay! Sir." 

" Schirene, shouldst like to see the 
Nile ?" 

" I have heard of crocodiles." 



18 THE WONDROUS TALE 



XIV. 

If the presence of Kisloch and his com- 
panions were not very pleasing to Alroy, 
with the rest of the band they soon be- 
came great favourites. Their local know- 
ledge, and their experience of desart life, 
made them valuable allies, and their bois- 
terous jocularity and unceasing merri- 
ment were not unwelcome in the present 
monotonous existenceof the fugitives. As 
for Alroy himself he meditated an escape 
to Egypt. He determined to seize the 
first opportunity of procuring some ca- 
mels, and then dispersing his band, with 
the exception of Benaiah and a few faith- 
ful retainers, he trusted that, disguised as 
merchants, they might succeed in cross- 



OF ALROY. 19 

ing Syria, and entering Africa by Pales- 
tine. With these plans and prospects, 
he became each day more cheerful, and 
more sanguine as to the future. He had 
in his possession some very valuable 
jewels, which he anticipated parting with 
at Cairo for a sum sufficient for all his 
purposes, and having exhausted all the 
passions of life while yet a youth, he 
looked forward to the tranquil termina- 
tion of his existence in some poetic soli- 
tude with his beautiful companion. 

One evening as they returned from 
the Oasis, Alroy guiding the camel that 
bore Schirene, and ever and anon look- 
ing up in her inspiring face, her san- 
guine spirit would have indulged in a 
delightful future. 

" Thus shall we pass the desart, sweet," 
said Schirene. '' Can this be toil ?" 



^0 THE WONDROUS TALE 

'' There is no toil with love," replied 
Alroy. 

*' And we were made for love, and not 
for empire/' rejoined Schirene. 

" The past is a dream," said Alroy. 
** So sages teach us ; but until we act, 
their wisdom is but wind. I feel it now. 
Have we ever lived in aught but desarts, 
and fed on aught but dates ? Methinks 
'tis very natural. But that I am tempted 
by the security of distant lands, I could 
remain here, a free and happy outlaw. 
Time, custom, and necessity form our 
natures. When I first met Scherirah in 
these ruins, I shrank with horror from 
degraded man ; and now I sigh to be his 
heir. We must not think V 

" No, love, we'll only hope," replied 
Schirene ; and they passed through the 
gates. 



OF ALROY. 21 

The night was beautiful, the air was 
still warm, and sweet. Schirene gazed 
upon the luminous heavens. " We 
thought not of these skies when we were 
at Bagdad," she exclaimed ; " and yet, 
my life, what was the brightness of our 
palaces compared to these ? All is left to 
us that man should covet, freedom, beauty, 
and youth. I do believe, ere long, 
Alroy, we shall look back upon the won- 
drous past, as on another and a lower 
world. Would this were Egypt! 'Tis 
my only wish." 

** And it shall soon be gratified. All 
will soon be arranged. A few brief days, 
and then Schirene will mount her camel 
for a longer ride than just to gather 
dates. You'll make a sorry traveller, 
I fear!" 

'^Notl; rU tire ye all." 



92 THE WONDROUS TALE 

They reached the circus, and seated 
themselves round the blazing- fire. Sel- 
dom had Alroy, since his fall, appeared 
more cheerful. Schirene sang an Arab 
air to the band, who joined in joyous 
chorus. It was late ere they sought re- 
pose ; and they retired to their rest san- 
guine and contented. 

A few hours after, at the break of 
dawn, Alroy was roused from his slum- 
bers by a rude pressure on his breast. 
He started ; a ferocious soldier was kneel- 
ing over him ; he would have spurned 
him ; he found his hand manacled. He 
would have risen, his feet were bound. He 
looked round for Schirene, and called her 
name ; he was answered only by a shriek. 
The amphitheatre was filled with Karas- 
mian troops. His own men were sur- 
prised and overpowered. Kisloch and 



OF ALROY. 23 

the Guebre had been on guard. He was 
raised from the ground, and flung upon 
a camel, which was instantly trotted out 
of the circus. On every side he beheld 
a wild scene of disorder and dismay. He 
was speechless from passion and despair. 
The camel was dragged into the desart. 
A body of cavalry instantly surrounded 
it, and they set off at a rapid pace. 
The whole seemed the work of an in- 
stant. 

How many days had passed Alroy 
knew not. He had taken no count of 
time. Night and day were to him the 
same. He was in a stupor. But the 
sweetness of the air, and the greenness of 
the earth, at length partially roused his 
attention. He was just conscious that 
they had quitted the desart. Before him 
was a noble river ; he beheld the Eu- 



24 THE WONDROUS TALE 

phrates from the very spot he had first 
viewed it in his pilgrimage. The strong 
association of ideas called back his me- 
mory. A tear stole down his cheek ; the 
bitter drop stole to his parched lips ; he 
asked the nearest horseman for water. 
The guard gave him a wetted sponge, 
with which, with difficulty, he contrived 
to wipe his lips, and then he let it fall 
to the ground. The Karasmian struck 
him. 

They arrived at the river. The prisoner 
was taken from the camel and placed in 
a covered boat. After some hours, they 
stopped and disembarked at a small vil- 
lage. Alroy was placed upon a donkey 
with his back to its head. His clothes 
were soiled and tattered. The children 
pelted him with mud. An old woman, 
with a fanatic curse, pi ^ced a crown of 



OF ALROy. 25 

paper on his brow. With difficulty his 
brutal guards prevented their victim 
from being torn to pieces. And in such 
fashion, towards noon of the fourteenth 
day, David Alroy again entered Bagdad. 



XV. 

The intelligence of the capture of Al- 
roy spread through the agitated city. 
The Moolahs bustled about as if they had 
received a fresh demonstration of the au- 
thenticity of the prophetic mission. All 
the Dervishes began begging. The men 
discussed affairs in the coffee-houses, and 
the women chatted at the fountains.' 

" They may say what they like, but I 
wish him well,'* said a fair Arab, as she 
arranged her veil. '* He may be an

gg THE WONDROUS TALE 

impostor, but he was a very handsome 
one." 

"^ All the women are for him, that's 
the truth," responded a companion ; " but 
then we can do him no good." 

" We can tear their eyes out," said a 
third. 

" And what do you think of Alp Ar- 
slan, truly ?" inquired a fourth. 

" I wish he were a pitcher, and then I 
could break his neck," said a fifth. 

" Only think of the Princess !" said a 
sixth. 

" Well 1 she has had a glorious time of 
it," said a seventh. 

" Nothing was too good for her," said 
an eighth. 

*' I like true love," said a ninth. 

^' Well ! I hope he will be too much 
for them all yet," said a tenth. 



OF ALROY. 27 

" I should not wonder/* said an ele- 
venth. 

" He can't," said a twelfth, " he has 
lost his sceptre/* 

" You don't say so," said a thirteenth. 

** It is too true," said a fourteenth. 

" Do you think he was a wizard ?" said 
a fifteenth. *' I vow if there be not a 
fellow looking at us behind those trees." 

" Impudent scoundrel !" said a six- 
teenth. " I wish it were Alroy. Let 
us all scream, and put down our veils." 

And the group ran away. 



XVI. 

Two stout soldiers were playing chess* 
in a coffee-house. 

" May I slay my mother,*' said one, 

c 2 



28 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" but I cannot make a move. I fought 
under him at Nehauend; and though I 
took the amnesty, I have half a mind now 
to seize my sword and stab the first Turk 
that enters." 

" 'Twere but sheer justice/' said his 
companion. " By my father's blessing, 
he was the man for a charge. They may 
say what they like, but compared with 
him. Alp Arslan is a white-livered 
Giaour.'' 

" Here is confusion to him and to thy 
last move. There's the dirhem, I can 
play no more. May I slay my mother, 
though, but I did not think he would 
have let himself be taken." 

'' By the blessing of my father, nor I ; 
but then he was asleep." 

" That makes a difference. He was 
betrayed." 



OF ALROY. Sg 

" All brave men are. They say Kis- 
loch and his set pocket their fifty thou- 
sand by the job." 

" May each dirhem prove a plague 
spot !" 

" Amen ! Dost remember Abner ?'' 

** May I slay my mother if I ever for- 
get him. He spoke to his men like so 
many lambs. What's become of the lady 
Miriam ?" 

" She is here." 

" That will cut Alroy." 

" He was ever fond of her. Dost re- 
member she gained Adoram's life ?" 

" Oh ! she could do anything — next to 
the Queen." 

" Before her, I say before her. He has 
refused the Queen, he never refused the 
Lady Miriam." 

" Because she asked less.'* 



so THE WONDROUS TALE 

'' Dost know it seemed to me that 
things never went on so well after Jabas- 
ter's death ?" 

" So say I. There was a something, 
eh?" 

'* A sort of a peculiar, as it were, kind 
of something, eh ?" 

'' You have well described it. Every 
man felt the same. I have often men- 
tioned it to my comrades. Say what you 
like, said I, but slay my mother, if ever 
since the old gentleman strangled himself 
things don't seem, as it were, in their na- 
tural propinquity. Twas the phrase I 
used." 

" A very choice one. Unless there's a 
natural propinquity, the best arranged 
matters will fall out. However, the ass 
sees farther than his rider, and so it was 
with Alroy, the best commander I ever 
served under, all the same." 



OF ALROY. 31 

: " Let's go forth and see how aflfairs 

run." 

" Ay, do. If we hear any one abuse 
Alroy, we'll cleave his skull." 

'* That will we. There are a good 
many of our stout fellows about; we 
might do something yet." 

" Who knows ?" 

XVII. 

A subterranean dungeon of the citadel 
of Bagdad held in its gloomy limits the 
late Lord of Asia. The captive did not 
sigh, or weep, or wail. He did not speak. 
He did not even think. For several days 
he remained in a state of stupor. On 
the morning of the fourth day, he almost 
unconsciously partook of the wretched 
provision which his gaolers brought him. 



32 THE WONDROUS TALE 

Their torches, round which the bats 
whirled and flapped their wings, and 
twinkled their small eyes, threw a ghast- 
ly glare over the nearer walls of the dun- 
geon, the extremity of which defied the 
vision of the prisoner ; and when the 
gaolers retired, Alroy was in complete 
darkness. 

The image of the past came back to 
him. He tried in vain to penetrate the 
surrounding gloom. His hands were 
manacled, his legs also were loaded with 
chains. The notion that his life might 
perhaps have been cruelly spared in order 
that it might linger on in this horrible 
state of conscious annihilation, filled him 
with frenzy. He would have dashed his 
fetters against his brow, but the chain 
restrained him. He flung himself upon 
the damp and rigid ground. His fall 



OF ALROY. ^ 

disturbed a thousand obscene things. 
He heard the quick glide of a serpent, 
the creeping retreat of the clustering- 
scorpions, and the swift escape of the 
dashing rats. His mighty calamities 
seemed slight, when compared with these 
petty miseries. His great soul could not 
support him under these noisome and 
degrading incidents. He sprang, in dis- 
gust, upon his feet, and stood fearful of 
moving, lest every step should introduce 
him to some new abomination. At 
length, exhausted nature was unable any 
longer to sustain him. He groped his 
way to the rude seat, cut in the rocky 
wall, which was his only accommodation. 
He put forth his hand. It touched the 
slimy fur of some wild animal, that in- 
stantly sprang away, its fiery eyes spark- 
ling in the dark. Alroy recoiled with a 

c5 



34 THE WONDROUS TALE 

sensation of woe-begone dismay. His 
shaken nerves could not sustain him un- 
der this base danger, and these foul and 
novel trials. He could not refrain from 
an exclamation of despair ; and when he 
remembered that he was now far beyond 
the reach of all human solace and sym- 
pathy, even all human aid, for a moment 
his mind seemed to desert him ; and he 
wrung his hands in forlorn and almost 
idiotic woe. 

An awful thing it is — the failing ener- 
gies of a master-mind. He who places 
implicit confidence in his genius, will 
find himself some day utterly defeated 
and deserted. 'Tis bitter ! Every paltry 
hind seems but to breathe to mock you. 
Slow, indeed, is such a mind to credit that 
the never-failing resource can at last be 
wanting. But so it is. Like a dried-up 



OF ALROY. 35 

fountain, the perennial flow and bright 
fertility have ceased, and ceased for ever. 
Then comes the madness of retrospection. 

Draw a curtain ! draw a curtain ! and 
fling- it over this agonizing anatomy — I 
can no more. 

The days of childhood, his sweet sis- 
ter's voice and smiling love, their inno- 
cent pastimes, and the kind solicitude of 
faithful servants, all the soft detail of mild 
domestic life, — these were the sights 
and memories that flitted in wild play 
before the burning vision of Alroy, and 
rose upon his tortured mind. Empire 
and glory, his sacred nation, his imperial 
bride, — these, these were nothing. Their 
worth had vanished with the creative soul 
that called them into action. The pure 
sympathies of nature alone remained, and 
all his thought and grief, all his intelli- 



36 THE WONDROUS TALE 

gence, all his emotion, were centred in 
his sister. 

It was the seventh morning. A guard 
entered at an unaccustomed hour, and, 
sticking a torch into, a niche in the wall, 
announced that a person was without 
who had permission to speak to the pri- 
soner. They were the first human ac- 
cents that had met the ear of Alroy 
during his captivity, which seemed to 
him an age, a long dark period, that 
cancelled all things. He shuddered at 
the harsh tones. He tried to answer, but 
his unaccustomed lips refused their office. 
He raised his heavy arms, and endea- 
voured to signify his consciousness of 
what had been uttered. Yet, indeed, he 
had not listened to the message without 
emotion. He looked forward to the 
grate with strange curiosity ; and as he 



OF ALROY. ^. 

looked, he trembled. The visitor en- 
tered, muffled in a dark caftan. The 
griard disappeared ; and the caftan, fall- 
ing to the ground, revealed Honain. 

" My beloved Alroy," said the brother 
of Jabaster ; and he advanced, and pressed 
him to his bosom. Had it been Miriam, 
Alroy might have at once expired ; but 
the presence of this worldly man called 
back his worldliness. The revulsion of 
his feelings was wonderful. Pride, per- 
haps even hope, came to his aid ; all the 
associations seemed to counsel exertion ; 
for a moment he seemed the same 
Alroy. 

" I rejoice to find at least thee safe, 
Honain." 

" I also, if my security may lead to 
thine." . 

'* Still whispering hope !" 



38 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" Despair is the conclusion of fools." 
" O Honain ! 'tis a great trial. I can 
play my part, and yet methinks 'twere 
better we had not again met. How is 
Schirene ?" 

" Thinking of thee." 

'* 'Tis something that she can think. 
My mind has gone. Where's Miriam ?" 

" Free." 

" That's something. Thou hast done 
that. Good, good Honain, be kind to that 
sweet child, if only for my sake. Thou 
art all she has left." 

'^ She hath thee." 

" Her desolation." 

" Live, and be her refuge." 

" How's that ? These walls— escape ? 
No, no ; it is impossible." 

" 1 do not deem it so." 

*' Indeed ! I'll do any thing. Speak !

" Calm thyself, my friend. There is

" Terms ! We might have made those

Terms with a captive victim ?" 

" Why victim ?'' 

" Is Arslan then so generous ?" 

" He is a beast, more savage than the 
boar that grinds its tusks within his

" I spoke of certainty. I did not men-

I'd not be here. I feel thy thoughtful

" In a word, thy life is safe." 

" What, spared !" 

" If it please thee." 

" Please me ! Life is sweet. I feel 
its sweetness. I want but little. Free- 
dom and solitude are all I ask. My life 
spared ! I'll not believe it. Thou hast 
done this deed, thou mighty man, that 
masterest all souls. Thou hast not for- 
gotten me, thou hast not forgotten the 
days gone by, thou hast not forgotten 
thine^- own Alroy ! Who calls thee 
worldly, is a slanderer. Oh, HonainI

" Tush, tush, sweet friend, I am a 
broken reed, but still I am free. This is 
no time for courtly phrases. Let's go, 
and go at once." 

" A moment, dear Alroy. I am no 
flatterer. What I said came from my 
heart, and doth concern us much and in- 
stantly. I was saying thou hast no com- 
mon mind, Alroy — indeed thou hast a 
mind unlike all others. Listen, my 
Prince. Thou hast read mankind deeply 
and truly. Few have seen more than 
thyself, and none have so rare a spring of 
that intuitive knowledge of thy race, 
which is a gem to which Experience is 
but a jeweller, and without which no 
Action can befriend us." 

" Well, well !» 

" A moment's calmness. Thou hast 
entered Bagdad in triumph, and thou

hast entered the same city with every 
contumely the base spirit of our race 
could cast upon its victim. 'Twas a 
great lesson." 

" I feel it so.'' 

'* And teaches us how vile and value- 
less is the opinion of our fellow men.'' 

'' Alas ! 'tis true." 

" I am glad to see thee in this whole- 
some temper. 'Tis full of wisdom." 

" The miserable are often wise."

act. Speculation should only sharpen 
Practice. The time hath come to prove

weakness, and I have worked upon it. 
Thy mere defeat or death will not blot 
out the stain upon their standard and 
their faith. The public mind is wild 
with fantasies since Alroy rose. Men's 
opinions flit to and fro with that fearful 
change that bodes no stable settlement of 
states. None know what to cling to, or 
where to place their trust. Creeds are 
doubted — authority disputed. They 
would gladly account for thy success by 
other than human means, yet must deny 
thy mission. There also is the fame of a 
fair and mighty Princess, a daughter of 
their Caliphs, which they would gladly 
clear. I mark all this, observe, and work 
upon it. So, could we devise some means 
by which thy lingering followers could 
be for ever silenced, this great scandal 
fairly erased, and the public frame

pulse, why they would concede much, 
much, very much."

fernal powers. Plead guilty." 

*' Well ! is there more ?" 

" Some trifle. They will then examine 
thee about the Princess. It is not diffi- 
cult to confess that Alroy won the Ca- 
liph's daughter by an irresistible spell — • 
and now 'tis broken."

" So, SO. Is that all ?" 

" The chief. Thou canst then address 
some phrases to the Hebrew prisoners, 
denying thy Divine mission, and so 
forth — to settle the public mind, ob- 
serve, upon this point for ever." 

" Ay, ay, and then ?" 

" No more, except for form, (upon the 
completion of the conditions, mind, you 
will be conveyed to what land you please, 
with such amount of treasure as you 
choose,) there is no more, except, I say,

to renounce our faith, and bow before 
their prophet." 

" Hah ! Art thou there ? Is this thy

" Never, never, never ! not a jot, not

Honain took the torch from the niche, 
and advanced to the grate. It was not 
fastened : he drew it gently open, and led 
forward a veiled and female figure. The 
veiled and female figure threw herself at 
the feet of Alroy, who seemed lost to 
what was passing. A soft lip pressed his 
hand. He started, his chains clanked.

" What voice is that ?" wildly ex- 
claimed the Prince of the Captivity. 
" It falls upon my ear like long forgotten

" I am that wretched thing they called 
thy bride." 

" Oh ! this indeed is torture ! What

impenetrable darkness cover our darker

" Alroy !"

" Sire," said Honain, advancing, and 
laying his hand gently on the arm of the 
captive, " I pray thee moderate this pas- 
sion. Thou hast some faithful friends 
here, who would fain commune in calm- 
ness for thy lasting welfare." 
" Welfare ! He mocks me.** 
" I beseech thee. Sire, be calm. If, 
indeed, I speak unto that great Alroy

pray remember, "tis not in palaces, or in 
the battle field alone, the heroic soul can 
conquer and command. Scenes like

is no man within this breathing- v^^orld

" So was our love." 

"And is, my Alroy !'* exclaimed the 
Princess. '^ Be calm, be calm, I pray 
thee ! For mv sake be calm ; I am calm 
for thine. Thou hast listened to all Ho- 
nain has told thee ; that wise man, my

he counsels, an empty word, a most un- 
meaning- form. But speak it, and thou 
art free, and Alroy and Schirene may 
blend again their glorious careers, and 
lives of sweet fruition. Dost thou not 
remember when walking in the garden 
of our joy, and palled with empire, how 
often hast thou sighed for some sweet 
isle unknown to man, where thou mightst 
pass thy days with no companion but my 
faithful self, and no adventures but our 
constant loves? Oh ! my beloved, that 
life may still be thine ! And dost thou

such fidelity, and deem thyself a wretch, 
when Paradise with all its beauteous gates

much, thy over-fond Schirene, who doats 
upon thy image in thy chains more than 
she did when those sweet hands of thine 
were bound with gems, and played with 
her bright locks \" 

" She speaks of another world. I do 
remember something. Who hast sent this

happy with my boy. There was no mi- 
sery but thy absence, sweet ! Methinks

'' Did I smile ?— I'll not believe it." 
" Indeed you did. Ah ! see he smiles 
again. Why this is freedom 1 There is 
no such thing as sorrow. 'Tis a lie to 
frighten fools !" 

«« Why, Honain, what's this ? 'T would

" Methinks they are gold.*' 

They were silent. Schirene drew Al- 
roy to his rough seat, and gently placing 
herself on his knees, threw her arms 
round his neck, and buried her face in 
his breast. After a few minutes she 
raised her head, and whispered in his ear 
in irresistible accents of sweet exultation, 
" We shall be free to-morrow \" 

*' To-morrow ! is the trial so near ?' 
exclaimed the captive with an agitated 
voice and changing countenance. *' To- 
morrow !" He threw Schirene aside some- 
what hastily, and sprang from his seat. 
" To-morrow ! would it were over! To-

dition. Take me to thy bosom, 'tis not 
stabbed. They did not stab thee. Thou 
seest me here communing with thy mur- 
derers. What then ? I am innocent. 
Ask them, dread ghost, and call upon 
their fiendish souls to say I am pure. 
They would make me dark as themselves, 
but shall not." 

" Honain, Honain!" exclaimed the 
Princess in a terrible whisper, as she 
flew to the Physician. *' He is wild 
again, he is wild. Calm him, calm him. 
Mark ! how he stands with his extended 
arms, and fixed and vacant eyes, mutter- 
ing most awful words ! My spirit fails 
me. It is too fearful." 

The Physician advanced and stood by 
the side of Alroy, but in vain attempted 
to catch his attention. He ventured to 



OP ALROY. 59 

touch his arm. The Prince started, 
turned round, and recognizing him, ex- 
claimed in a shrieking voice, " Off, 
fratricide !" 

Honain recoiled pale and quivering. 
Schirene sprang to his arm. " What said 
he, Honain ? Thou dost not speak. I 
never saw thee pale before. Art thou too 
mad r 

" Would I were !" 

" All men are growing wild. I am 
sure he said something. I pray thee tell 
me. What was it ?" 

" Ask him." 

*' I dare not. Tell me — tell me, 
Honain!" 

" That I dare not." 

" Was it a word ?" 

" Ay ! a word to wake the dead. Let 
us begone."

" Without our end ? Coward ! I'll 
speak to him. My own Alroy/' sweetly 
whispered the Princess, as she advanced 
before him. 

" What, has the fox left the tigress ! 
Is't so, eh, eh ? Are there no judgments ? 
Are the innocent only haunted ? I am 
innocent ; I did not strangle thee ! He 
said rightly. Beware, beware ! they who 
did this, may do even fouler deeds. And 
here they are quick at their damned work. 
Thy body suffered, great Jabaster, but

arms of the advancing Honain, w^ho bore 
her out of the dungeon.

XVIII. 

After the fall of Hamadan, Bostenay 
and Miriam had been carried prisoners to 
Bagdad. Through the interference of 
Honain, their imprisonment had been 
exempted from the usual hardships ; but 
they were still confined to their chambers 
in the citadel. Hitherto all the endea- 
vours of Miriam to visit her brother 
had been fruitless. Honain was the only 
person to whom she could apply for 
assistance, and he, in answer to her im- 
portunities, only regretted his want of 
power to aid her. In vain had she at- 
tempted, by the offer of some remaining 
jewels, to secure the co-operation of her 



62 THE WONDROUS TALE 

guards, with whom her loveliness and the 
softness of her manners had already in- 
gratiated her. She had not succeeded 
even in communicating with Alroy. But 
after the unsuccessful mission of Honain 
to the dungeon, the late Vizier visited 
the sister of the captive, and breaking to 
her with delicate skill the intelligence of 
the impending catastrophe, he announced 
that he had at length succeeded in ob- 
taining for her the desired permission to 
visit her brother, and while she shud- 
dered at the proximity of an event for 
which she had long attempted to prepare 
herself, Honain, with some modifications, 
whispered the means by which he flat- 
tered himself it might yet be averted. 
Miriam listened to him in silence, nor 
could he with all his consummate art 
succeed in extracting from her the slight- 



OF ALROY. 63 

est indication of her own opinion as to 
their expediency. They parted, Honain 
as sanguine as the wicked ever are. 

As Miriam dreaded, both for herself 
and for Ah'oy, the shock of an unex- 
pected meeting, she availed herself of the 
influence of Honain to send Caleb to her 
brother, to prepare him for her presence, 
and to consult him as to the desirable 
moment. Caleb found his late master 
lying exhausted on the floor of his dun- 
geon . At first he would not speak, or even 
raise his head, nor did he for a longtime 
apparently recognize the faithful retainer 
of his uncle. But at length he grew 
milder, and when he fully comprehended 
who the messenger was, and the object of 
the mission, he at first seemed altogether 
disinclined to see his sister, but in the end 
postponed their meeting for the present. 



64 THE WONDROUS TALE 

and, pleading great exhaustion, fixed for 
that sad union, the first hour of dawn. 

The venerable Bostenay had scarcely 
ever spoken since the fall of his nephew : 
indeed it was but too evident that his 
faculties, even if they had not entirely de- 
serted him, were at least greatly impaired. 
He never quitted his couch, he took no 
notice of what occurred. He evinced no 
curiosity, scarcely any feeling. If indeed 
he occasionally did mutter an observation, 
it was generally of an irritable character, 
nor truly did he appear satisfied if any 
one approached him, save Miriam, from 
whom alone he would accept the scanty 
victuals which he ever appeared disin- 
clined to touch. But his devoted niece, 
amid all her harrowing affliction, could 
ever spare to the protector of her youth 
a placid countenance, a watchful eye, a 



OF ALROY. 65 

gentle voice, and a ready hand. Her re- 
ligion and her virtue, the strength of her 
faith, and the inspiration of her inno- 
cence, supported this pure and hapless 
lady amid all her undeserved and unpa- 
ralleled sorrows. 

It was long past midnight, the young 
widow of Abner reposed upon a couch in 
a soft slumber. The amiable Beruna, 
and the beautiful Bathsheba, the blinds 
withdrawn, watched the progress of the 
night. 

" Shall I wake her ?" said the beauti- 
ful Bathsheba. '' Methinks the stars are 
paler ! She bid me rouse her long before 
the dawn." 

" Her sleep is too beautiful I Let us not 
wake her," replied the amiable Beruna. 
'* We rouse her only to sorrow." 

" May her dreams at least be happy," 



66 THE WONDROUS TALE 

rejoined the beautiful Bathsheba. '' She 
sleeps tranquilly, as a flower." 

" The veil has fallen from her head," 
said the amiable Beruna. '' I will re- 
place it lig-htly on her brow. Is that 
well, my Bathsheba ?" 

" It is well, sweet Beruna. Her face 
shrouded by the shawl is like a pearl in 
its shell. See ! she moves !" 

" Bathsheba !" 

" I am here, sweet lady." 

" Is it near dawn ?" 

" Not yet, sweet lady ; it is yet nig-ht. 
It is long past the noon of night, sweet 
lady ; methinks I scent the rising breath 
of morn ; but still 'tis night, and the 
young moon shines like a sickle in the 
heavenly field, amid the starry harvest." 

" Beruna, gentle girl, give me thy 
arm. Til rise." 



OF ALROY. 67 

The maidens advanced, and gently- 
raising their mistress, supported her to 
the window. 

'' Since our calamities," said Miriam, 
" I have never proved such tranquil slum- 
ber. My dreams were slight but sooth- 
ing. I saw him, but he smiled. Have I 
slept long, sweet girls ? Give me a kiss. 
Ye are very watchful." 

" Dear lady, let me bring thy shawl. 
The air is fresh — " 

" But sweet ; I thank thee, no. My 
brow is not so cool it needs a covering. 
'Tis a fair night V 

Miriam gazed upon the wide prospect 
of the moonlit capital. The eminent po- 
sition of the citadel afforded an extensive 
view of the mighty groups of buildings, 
each in itself a city, broken only by some 
vast and hooded cupola, the tall, thin, 



68 THE WONDROUS TALE 

white minarets of the mosques, or the 
black and spiral form of some lonely cy- 
press, and through which the rushing 
Tigris, flooded with light, sent forth its 
broad and brilliant torrent. All was si- 
lent; not a single boat floated on the 
fleet river, not a solitary voice broke the 
stillness of slumbering millions. She 
gazed, and as she gazed, she could not 
refrain from contrasting the present scene, 
which seemed the sepulchre of all the 
passions of our race, with the unrivalled 
excitement of that stirring spectacle which 
Bagdad aflbrded on the celebration of the 
marriage of Alroy. How different then, 
too, was her position to her present, and 
how happy ! The only sister of a devoted 
brother, the lord and conqueror of Asia, 
the bride of his most victorious captain, 
one worthy of all her virtues, and whose 



OF ALROY. 69 

youthful valour had encircled her brow 
with a diadem. For Miriam, exalted 
station had brought neither cares nor 
crimes. It had, as it were, only rendered 
her charity universal, and her benevo- 
lence omnipotent. She could not accuse 
herself — this blessed woman — she could 
not accuse herself, even in this searching 
hour of self-knowledge — she could not 
accuse herself, with all her meekness, and 
modesty, and humility, of having for a 
moment forgotten her dependence on 
her God, or her duty to her neigh- 
bour. 

But when her thoughts recurred to 
that being from whom they were indeed 
scarcely ever absent ; and when she re- 
membered him, and all his life, and all 
the thousand incidents of his youth, 
mysteries to the world, and known only 



70 THE WONDROUS TALE 

to her, but which were indeed the pre- 
science of his fame, and thought of all 
his surpassing qualities, and all his sweet 
affection, his unrivalled glory, and his 
impending fate, the tears, in silent agony, 
forced their way down her pale and pen- 
sive cheek. She bowed her head upon 
Bathsheba's shoulder, and sweet Beruna 
pressed her quivering hand. 

The moon set, the stars grew white and 
ghastly, and, one by one, vanished away. 
Over the distant plain of the Tigris, the 
scene of the marriage pomp, the dark 
purple horizon shivered into a rich streak 
of white and orange. The solemn strain 
of the Muezzin sounded from the Mina- 
rets. Some one knocked at the door. It 
was Caleb. 

" I am ready," said Miriam ; and 
for a moment she covered her face with 



OF ALROY. *ft 

her right hand. '' Think of me, sweet 
maidens ; pray for me !" 



XIX. 

Leaning on Caleb, and lighted by a 
gaoler, bearing torches, Miriam descended 
the damp and broken stairs that led to 
the dungeon. She faultered as she ar- 
rived at the grate. She stopped, and 
leant against the cold and gloomy wall. 
The gaoler and Caleb preceded her. She 
heard the voice of Alroy. It was firm 
and sweet. Its accents re-assured her. 
Caleb came forth with a torch, and held 
it to her feet ; and as he bent down, he 
said, " My Lord bid me beg you to be of 
good heart, for he is.'' 

The gaoler having stuck his torch in 



72 THE WONDROUS TALE 

the niche, withdrew. Miriam desired 
Caleb to stay without. Then, summon- 
ing up all her energies, she entered the 
dreadful abode. Alroy was standing to 
receive her. The light fell full upon his 
countenance. It smiled. Miriam could 
no longer restrain herself. She ran for- 
ward, and pressed him to her heart. 

'' Oh, my best, my long beloved," 
whispered Alroy ; " such a meeting in- 
deed leads captivity captive !" 

But the sister could not speak. She 
leant her head upon his shoulder, and 
closed her eyes, that she might not 
weep. 

" Courage, dear heart ; courage, cou- 
rage !" whispered the captive. " Indeed 
I am very happy !" 

" My brother, my brother !" 

" Had we met yesterday, you would

have found me perhaps a little vexed. 
But to-day I am myself again. Since I 
crossed the Tigris, I know not that I 
have felt such self-content. I have had 
sweet dreams, dear Miriam, full of solace, 
and more than dreams. The Lord has 
pardoned me, I truly think," 

" Oh, my brother ! your words are full 
of comfort; for, indeed, I too have 
dreamed, and dreamed of consolation. 
My spirit since our fall has never been 
more tranquil." 

" Indeed I am very happy." 

" Say so again, my David ; let me 
hear again these words of solace !" 

" Indeed, 'tis very true, my faithful 
friend. It is not spoken in kind mockery 
to make you joyous. For know, last eve, 
whether the Lord repented of his wrath, 
or whether some dreadful trials, of which

we will not speak, and wish not to re- 
member, had made atonement for my 
manifold sins — but so it was, that about 
the time my angel Miriam sent her 
soothing- message, a feeling of repose came 
over me, such as 1 long have coveted. 
Anon, I fell into a slumber, deep and 
sweet, and for those wild and whirling 
images, that of late have darted from my 
brain when it should rest, — glimpses of 
empire and conspiracy, snatches of fierce 
wars and mocking loves, — I stood beside 
our native fountain's brink, and gathered 
flowers with my earliest friend. As I 
placed the fragrant captives in your flow- 
ing locks, and kissed you when you 
smiled, there came Jabaster, that great, 
injured man, no longer stern and awful, 
but with benignant looks, and full of 
love. And he said, * David, the Lord 



OF ALROY. 75 

hath marked thy faithfiihiess, despite the 
darkness of thy dungeon/ So he va- 
nished. He spoke, my sister, of some 
strange temptations by heavenly aid 
withstood. No more of that. I awoke. 
And lo ! I heard my name still called. 
Full of my morning dream, I thought 
it was you, and I answered, * Dear 
sister, art thou here ?' But no one 
answered ; and then reflecting, my 
memory recognized those thrilling tones 
that summoned Alroy in Jabaster's 
cave." 

" The Daughter of the Voice ?" 
" Even that sacred messenger. I am 
full of faith. The Lord hath pardoned 
me. Be sure of that." 

" I cannot doubt it, David. You have 
done great things for Israel ; no one in 
these latter days has risen like you. If 

e2 



76 THE WONDROUS TALE 

you have fallen, you were young, and 
strangely tempted." 

'' Yet Israel, Israel ! Did I not feel a 
worthier leader awaits my country yet, 
my heart would crack. I have betrayed 
my country !" 

" Oh no, no, no ! You have shown 
what we can do, and shall. Your memory 
alone is inspiration. A great career, al- 
though baulked of its end, is still a land- 
mark of human energy. Failure, when 
sublime, is not without its purpose. 
Great deeds are great legacies, and work 
with wondrous usury. By what Man 
has done, we learn what Man can do ; 
and gauge the power and prospects of our 
race." 

" Alas ! there is no one to guard my 
name. 'Twill be reviled ; or worse, 'twill 
be forgotten !" 



OF ALROY. 77 

" Never, never! the memory of great 
actions never dies. The Sun of glory, 
though awhile obscured, will shine at 
last. And so, sweet brother, perchance 
some poet, in some distant age, within 
whose veins our sacred blood may flow, 
his fancy fired with the national theme, 
may strike his harp to Alroy's wild career, 
and consecrate a name too long for- 
gotten !" 

" May love make thee a prophetess !" 
exclaimed Alroy, as he bent down his 
head and embraced her. " Sweetest,'* 
he whispered, " do not tarry. Tis better 
we should part in this firm mood." 

She sprang from him, she clasped her 
hands. " We will not part," she ex- 
claimed, with energy ; " I will die with 
thee." 

" Blessed girl, be calm, be calm ! Do 
not unman me." 



78 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" I am calm. See ! I do not weep. 
Not a tear, not a tear. They are all in 
my heart." 

" Go, go, my Mh'iam, angel of light 
and loveliness ! Tarry no longer : I pray 
thee go. I would not think of the past. 
Let all my mind be centred in the pre- 
sent. Thy presence calls back our bye- 
gone days and softens me too much. My 
duty to my uncle. Go, dearest, go !" 

" And leave thee, leave thee to oh! 

my David, thou hast seen, thou hast 
heard Honain ?" 

" No more, no more ; let not that ac- 
cursed name profane those holy lips. 
Raise not the dsemon in me." ' 

" I am silent, I am silent. Yet, yet 
'tis madness, 'tis madness ! Oh ! my bro- 
ther, thou hast a fearful trial." 

" The God of Israel is my refuge. He 



OF ALROY. 79 

saved our fathers in the fiery furnace. 
He will save me." 

'^ I am full of faith. I pray thee let 
me stay." 

" I would be silent, I vrould be alone. 
I cannot speak, Miriam. I ask one favor, 
the last and dearest, from her who has 
never had a thought but for my v^^ishes — 
blessed being, leave me." 

"I go. Oh ! Alroy, farewell ! Let 
me kiss you. Again, once more ! Let 
me kneel and bless you. Brother, be- 
loved brother, great and glorious brother, 
I am worthy of you : I will not weep. 
I am prouder this dread moment of your 
love, than all your foes can be of their 
hard triumph !"

Beruna and Bathsheba received their 
mistress when she returned to her cham- 
ber. They marked her desolate air. She 
was silent, pale, and cold. They bore 
her to her couch, whereon she sat with a 
most listless and unmeaning look, her 
quivering lips parted, her eyes fixed 
upon the ground in vacant abstraction, 
and her arms languidly folded before 
her. Beruna stole behind her, and sup- 
ported her back with pillows, and Bath- 
sheba, unnoticed, wiped the slight foam 
from her mouth. Thus Miriam remained 
for several hours, her faithful maidens in 
vain watching for any indication of her 
self-consciousness. 



OF ALROY 81 

Suddenly a trumpet sounded. 

" What is that ?" exclaimed Miriam, 
in a shrill voice, and looking up with a 
distracted glance. 

Neither of them answered, since they 
were aware it betokened the going forth 
of Alroy to his trial. 

Miriam remained in the same posture, 
and with the same expression of wild in- 
quiry. Another trumpet sounded, and 
after that a shout of the people. Then 
she raised up her arms to Heaven, and 
bowed her head — and died.

" Has the second trumpet sounded ?" 
" To be sure : run, run for a good 
place. Where is Abdallah ?"

" Selling sherbet in the square. We 
shall find him. Has Alroy come 
forth r 

'* Yes ! he goes the other way. We 
shall be too late. Only think of Abdallah 
selling sherbet !" 

*' Father, let me go ?'* 

" You will be in the way ; you are too 
young ; you will see nothing. Little 
boys should stay at home." 

*' No, they should not. I will go. 
You can put me on your shoulders." 

" Where is Ibrahim ? Where is AH ? 
We must all keep together. We shall 
have to fight for it. I wish Abdallah 
were here. Only think of his selling 
sherbet !" 

" Keep straight forward. That is 
right. It is no use going that way. 
The Bazaar is shut. There is Fakreddin, 



OF ALROY. 83 

there is Osman EfFendi. He has got a 
new paoi'e/' 

" So he has, I declare ; and a very 
pretty boy too." 

'* Father, will they impale Alroy 
alive ?" 

" I am sure I do not know. Never 
ask questions, my dear. Little boys 
never should.** 

" Yes they should. Oh my ! I hope 
they will impale him alive. I shall be 
so disappointed if they do not." 

" Keep to the left. Dash through the 
Butcher's Bazaar : that is open. All 
right, all right. Did you push me. 

Sir r 

'^ Suppose T did push you, Sir — what 
then, Sir ?" 

'' Come along, don't quarrel. That is 
a Karasmian. They think they are to do 



84 THE WONDROUS TALE 

what they like. We are five to one to 
be sure, but still there is nothing like 
peace and quiet. I wish Abdallah were 
here with his stout shoulders. Only 
think of his selling sherbet !" 

XXII. 

The Square of the Grand Mosque, the 
same spot where Jabaster met Abidan by 
appointment, was the intended scene of 
the pretended trial of Alroy. Thither 
by break of day the sight-loving thou- 
sands of the capital had repaired. In the 
centre of the Square a large circle was 
described by a crimson cord, and guarded 
by Karasmian soldiers ; around this the 
swelling multitude pressed like the ga- 
thering waves of ocean, but whenever the 
tide set in with too great an impulse, the 



OF ALROY. 85 

savage Karasmians appeased the ungo- 
vernable element by raising- their brutal 
battle-axes, and breaking the crowns and 
belabouring: the shoulders of their nearest 
victims. As the morning- advanced, the 
terraces of the surrounding houses, covered 
with awnings, were crowded with spec- 
tators. All Baofdad was about. Since 
the marriage of Alroy, there had never 
been such a merry morn as the day of 
his impalement. 

At one end of the circle was erected a 
magnificent throne. Half-way between 
the throne and the other end of the 
circle, but farther back, stood a company 
of Negro eunuchs, hideous to behold, who, 
clothed in white and armed with various 
instruments of torture, surrounded the 
enormous stakes, tall, thin, and sharp, 
that were prepared for the final ceremony. 



86 THE WONDROUS TALE 

The flourish of trumpets, the clash of 
cymbals, and the wild beat of the tam- 
bour, announced the arrival of Alp 
Arslan from the Serail. An avenue to 
the circle had been preserved through 
the multitude. The royal procession 
might be traced as it wound through the 
populace by the sparkling and undu- 
lating line of plumes of honour, and the 
dazzling forms of the waving streamers, 
on which were inscribed the names of 
Allah and the Prophet. Suddenly, amid 
the bursts of music, and the shouts of the 
spectators, many of whom on the terraces 
humbled themselves on their knees. Alp 
Arslan mounted the throne, around 
which ranged themselves his chief cap- 
tains, and a deputation of the Moollahs, 
and Imams, and Cadis, and other prin- 
cipal personages of the city. 



OF ALROY. 87 

The King of Kai-asme was very tall in 
stature, and somewhat meagre in form. 
He was fair, or rather, sandy-coloured, 
with a red beard, and blue eyes, and a 
flat nose. The moment he was seated a 
trumpet was heard in the distance from 
an opposite quarter, and it was soon un- 
derstood throughout the assembly that 
the great captive was about to appear. 

A band of Karasmian guards first en- 
tered the circle and ranged themselves 
round the cord with their backs to the 
spectators. After them came fifty of the 
principal Hebrew prisoners, with their 
hands bound behind them, but evidently 
more for form than security. To these 
succeeded a small covered waggon drawn 
by mules, and surrounded by guards, 
from which was led forth, his legs re- 
lieved from their manacles, but his 



88 THE WONDROUS TALE 

hands still in heavy chains, David 
Alroy ! 

An universal buzz of blended sympa- 
thy, and wonder, and fear, and triumph, 
arose throughout the whole assembly. 
Each man involuntarily stirred. The 
vast populace moved to and fro in agita- 
tion. His garments soiled and tattered, 
his head bare, and his long locks drawn 
off his forehead, pale, and very thin, but 
still unsubdued, the late conqueror and 
Caliph of Bagdad threw around a calm 
and imperial glance upon those who were 
but recently his slaves. 

The trumpets again sounded, order was 
called, and a crier announced that his 
Highness Alp Arslan, the mighty Sove- 
reign of Karasme, their Lord, Protector, 
and King, and avenger of AHah and the 
Prophet, against all rebellious and evil- 



OF ALROY. 89 

minded Jews and Giaours, was about to 
speak. There was a deep and universal 
silence, and then sounded a voice high as 
the eagle's in a storm. 

" David Alroy !" said his conqueror. 
'' You are brought here this day neither 
for trial nor for judgment. Captured in 
arms against your rightful sovereign, you 
are of course prepared, like other rebels, 
for your doom. Such a crime alone de- 
serves the most avenging punishments. 
What then do you merit, who are loaded 
writh a thousand infamies, who have blas- 
phemed Allah and the Prophet, and by 
the practice of magic arts, and the aid of 
the infernal powers, have broken the 
peace of kingdoms, occasioned infinite 
bloodshed, outraged all law, religion, and 
decency, misled the minds of your de- 
luded votaries, and especially by a direct 



90 THE WONDROUS TALE 

compact with Eblis, by the most horrible 
spells and infamous incantations, cap- 
tivated the senses of an illustrious Prin- 
cess, heretofore famous for the practice of 
every virtue, and a descendant of the 
Prophet himself. 

" Behold those stakes of palm wood, 
sharper than a lance ! The most terrible 
retribution that human ingenuity has 
devised for the guilty awaits you. But 
your crimes baffle all human vengeance. 
Look forward for your satisfactory re- 
ward to those infernal powers by whose 
dark co-operation you have occasioned 
such disasters. Your punishment is pub- 
lic, that all men may know that the 
guilty never escape, and that, if your 
heart be visited by the slightest degree of 
compunction for your numerous victims, 
you may this day, by the frank confession 



OF ALROY. 91 

of the irresistible means by which you 
seduced them, exonerate your victims 
from the painful and ignominious end 
with which, through your influence, they 
are now threatened. Mark, O assem- 
bled people, the infinite mercy of the 
Vicegerent of Allah ! He allows the 
wretched man to confess his infamy, and 
to save, by his confession, his unfortunate 
victims. I have said it. Glory to 
Allah!" 

And the people shouted, '* He has said 
it, he has said it ! Glory to Allah ! He 
is great, he is great ! and Mahomed is his 
prophet !" 

"Am I to speak?" inquired Alroy, 
when the tumult had subsided. The me- 
lody of his powerful voice commanded 
universal attention. 

Alp Arslan nodded his head in appro- 
bation. 



92 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" King of Karasme ! I stand here 
accused of many crimes. Now hear my 
answers. 'Tis said I am a rebel. My 
answer is, I am a Prince as thou art, of a 
sacred race, and far more ancient. I owe 
fealty to no one but to my God, and if I 
have broken that, I am yet to learn Alp 
Arslan is the avenger of his power. As 
for thy God and Prophet, 1 know not 
them, though they acknowledge mine. 
'Tis well understood in every polity, my 
people stand apart from other nations, 
and ever will, despite of suffering. So 
much for blasphemy ; I am true to a deep 
faith of ancient days which even the 
sacred writings of thy race still reverence. 
For the arts magical I practised, and the 
connnunion with infernal powers 'tis 
said I held, know. King, I raised the 
standard of my faith, by the direct com- 



OF ALROY. 0ft 

mandment of my God, the great Creator 
of the universe. What need of magic 
then ? what need of paltering with petty 
fiends when backed by his omnipotence ? 
My magic was his inspiration. Need 
I prove why with such aid, my people 
crowded round me ? The time will come 
from out our ancient seed, a worthier chief 
will rise, not to be quelled even by thee. 
Sir. 

'* For that unhappy Princess of whom 
something was said, with no great mercy 
as it seemed to me, that lady is my wife, 
my willing wife, the daughter of a Ca- 
liph — still my wife, although your stakes 
may make her soon a widow. I stand 
not here to account for female fancies. 
Believe me. Sire, she gave her beauty to 
my raptured arms with no persuasions 
but such as became a soldier and a king. 



94 THE WONDROUS TALE 

It may seem strange to thee upon thy 
throne, the flower of Asia should be 
plucked by one so vile as I am. Sir. 
Remember, the accidents of Fortune are 
most strange, I was not always what I 
am. We have met before. There was a 
day, and that too not long since, when, 
but for the treachery of some knaves I 
mark there. Fortune seemed half inclined 
to reverse our fates. Had I conquered, 
I trust I should have shown more 
mercy." 

The King of Karasme was the most 
passionate of men. He had made a speech 
according to the advice and instructions 
of his counsellors, who had assured him, 
that the tone he adopted would induce 
Alroy to confess all that he required, and 
especially to vindicate the reputation of 
the Princess Fchirene, who had already 



OF ALROY. 95 

contrived to persuade Alp Arslan that 
she was the most injured of her sex. The 
King of Karasme stamped thrice on the 
platform of his throne, and exclaimed 
with great fire, " By my beard, ye have 
deceived me; the dog has confessed 
nothing 1" 

All the counsellors and chief Cap- 
tains, and the Moollahs, and the Imams, 
and the Cadis, and the principal person- 
ages of the city, were in great consterna- 
tion. They immediately consulted to- 
gether, and after much disputation, agreed 
that before they proceeded to extremities 
it was expedient to prove what the pri- 
soner would not confess. A most vene- 
rable Scheik, clothed in flowing robes of 
green, with a long white beard, and a 
turban like the tower of Babel, then rose. 
His sacred reputation procured silence 



96 THE WONDROUS TALE 

while he himself delivered a long prayer, 
supplicating Allah and the prophet to con- 
found all blaspheming Jews and Giaours, 
and to pour forth words of truth from the 
mouths of religious men. And then the 
venerable Scheik summoned all witnesses 
against David Alroy. Immediately ad- 
vanced Kisloch the Kourd, who being 
placed in an eminent position, the Cadi 
of Bagdad drew forth a scroll from his 
velvet bag, and read to him a deposition 
wherein the worthy Kisloch stated, that 
he first became acquainted with the pri- 
soner, David Alroy, in some ruins in the 
desart ; the haunt of banditti, of whom 
Alroy was the chief; that he, Kisloch, 
was a reputable merchant, and that his 
caravan had been plundered by these 
robbers, and he himself captured : that 
on the second night of his imprisonment, 



OF ALROY. 97 

Alroy appeared to him in the likeness of 
a lion, and on the third, of a bull with 
fiery eyes : that he was in the habit of 
constantly transforming himself; that he 
frequently raised spirits ; that at length, 
on one terrible night, Eblis himself came 
in great procession, and presented Alroy 
with the sceptre of Solomon Ben Daoud ; 
and that the next day Alroy raised his 
standard, and soon after massacred Hassan 
Subah and his Seljuks, by the visible aid 
of many terrible demons. 

Calidas the Indian, the Guebre, and 
the Negro, and a few congenial spirits, 
were not eclipsed in the satisfactory cha- 
racter of their evidence by the luminous 
testimony of Kisloch the Kourd. The 
irresistible career of the Hebrew con- 
queror was undeniably accounted for, and 
the honour of the Moslemin arms, and 

VOL. III. F 



98 THE WONDROUS TALE 

the purity of the Moslemin faith, were 
established in their pristine glory, and 
all their unsullied reputation. David 
Alroy was proved to be a child of Eblis, 
a sorcerer, and a dealer in charms and 
magical poisons. The people listened 
with horror and with indignation. They 
would have burst through the guards and 
have torn him to pieces, had not they 
been afraid of the Karasmian battle-axes. 
So they consoled themselves with the 
prospect of his approaching tortures. 

The Cadi of Bagdad bowed himself be- 
fore the King of Karasme, and whispered 
at a respectful distance in the royal ear. 
The trumpets sounded, the criers en- 
joined silence, and the royal lips again 
moved. 

" Hear, oh ! ye people, and be wise. 
The chief Cadi is about to read the depo- 



OF ALROY. 99 

sition of the royal Princess Schirene, chief 
victim of the sorcerer/' 

And the deposition was read, which 
stated that David Alroy possessed, and 
wore next to his heart, a talisman, given 
him by Eblis, of which the virtue was so 
great, that if once it were pressed to the 
heart of any woman, she was no longer 
mistress of her will. Such had been the 
unhappy fate of the daughter of the 
Commander of the Faithful. 

''Is it so written ?" inquired the cap- 
tive. 

"It is so written," replied the Cadi, 
" and bears the imperial signature of the 
Princess." 

" It is a forgery." 

The King of Karasme started from his 
throne, and in his rage nearly descended 
its steps. His face was like scarlet, his 

f2 



100 THE WONDROUS TALE 

beard like a flame. A favourite minister 
ventured gently to restrain the royal robe. 

" Kill the dog on the spot," muttered 
the King of Karasrae. 

" The Princess is herself here," said 
the Cadi, " to bear witness to the spells of 
which she was a victim, but from which, 
by the power of Allah and the prophet, 
she is now released." 

Alroy started ! 

'' Advance, royal Princess," said the 
Cadi, " and if the depo.^ition thou hast 
heard be indeed true, condescend to hold 
up the imperial hand that adorned it with 
thy signature." 

A band of eunuchs near the throne 
gave way, a female figure veiled to her 
feet appeared. She held up her hand 
amid the breathless agitation of the whole 
assembly ; the ranks of the eunuchs again 



OF ALROY. 101 

closed ; a loud shriek was heard, and the 
veiled figure disappeared. 

" I am ready for thy tortures, King,'* 
said Alroy, in a tone of deep depression. 
His firmness appeared to have deserted 
him. His eyes v^ere cast upon the 
ground. Apparently he was buried in 
profound thought, or had delivered him- 
self up to despair. 

" Prepare the stakes," said Alp Arslan. 

An involuntary, but universal, shudder 
might be distinguished through the whole 
assembly. 

A slave advanced and offered Alroy a 
scroll. He recognized the Nubian who 
belonged to Honain. His former minis- 
ter informed him that he was at hand, 
that the terms he offered in the dungeon 
might even yet be granted , that if Alroy 
would, as he doubted not, as he entreated 



102 THE WONDROUS TALE 

him, accept them, he was to place the 
scroll in his bosom, but that if he were 
still inexorable, still madly determined 
on a horrible and ignominious end, he 
was to tear the scroll, and throw it into 
the arena. Instantly Alroy took the 
scroll, and with great energy tore it into 
a thousand pieces. A pufF of wind car- 
ried the fragments far and wide. The 
mob fought for these last memorials of 
David Alroy ; and this little incident oc- 
casioned a great confusion. 

In the meantime the Negroes prepared 
the instruments of torture and of death. 

'' The obstinacy of this Jewish dog 
makes me mad,'* said the King of Ka- 
rasme to his courtiers. " I will hold 
some parley with him before he dies." 
The favourite minister entreated his so- 
vereign to be content ; but the royal 



OF ALROY. 103 

beard grew so red, and the royal eyes 
flashed forth such terrible sparks of fire, 
that even the favourite minister at length 
g^ve way. 

The trumpets sounded, the criers called 
silence, and the voice of Alp Arslan was 
again heard. 

" Thou dog, dost see what is preparing 
for thee ? Dost know what awaits thee 
in the halls of thy master Eblis ? Can a 
Jew be influenced even by false pride } 
Is not life sweet ? Is it not better to be 
my slipper bearer than to be impaled ?" 

" Magnanimous Alp Arslan,^' replied 
Alroy , in a tone of undisguised contempt ; 
" thinkest thou that any torture can be 
equal to the recollection that I have been 
conquered by thee ?" 

" By my beard, he mocks me," ex- 
claimed the Karasmian monarch, " he 



104 THE WONDROUS TALE 

defies me. Touch not my robe. I will 
parley with him. Ye see no farther than 
a hooded hawk, ye sons of a blind mo- 
ther. This is a sorcerer ; he hath yet 
some master spell ; he will yet save him- 
self. He will fly into the air, or sink 
into the earth. He laughs at our tor- 
tures." The King of Karasme precipi- 
tately descended the steps of his throne, 
followed by his favourite minister, and 
his counsellors, and chief captains, and 
the Cadis, and the Moollahs, and the 
Imams, and the principal personages of 
the city. 

" Sorcerer !'' exclaimed Alp Arslan, 
" insolent sorcerer ! base son of a base 
mother ! dog of dogs ! dost thou defy us ? 
Does thy master Eblis whisper hope ? 
Dost thou laugh at our punishments ? 
Wilt thou fly into the air ? wilt thou 



OF ALROY. 105 

sink into the earth ? eh, eh ? Is it so, is 
it so ?" The breathless monarch ceased, 
from the exhaustion of passion. He tore 
his beard up by the roots, he stamped 
with uncontrollable rag-e. 

'* Thou art wiser than thy counsellors, 
royal Arslan ; I do defy thee. My mas- 
ter, although not Eblis, has not deserted 
me. I laugh at thy punishments. Thy 
tortures I despise. I shall both sink into 
the earth, and mount into the air. Art 
thou answered ?" 

" By my beard," exclaimed the en- 
raged Arslan, " I am answered. Let 
Eblis save thee, if he can ;" and the King 
of Karasme, the most famous master of 
the sabre in Asia, drew his blade like 
lightning from its sheath, and carried off 
the head of Alroy at a stroke. It fell, 
and as it fell, a smile of triumphant de-

features of the hero, and to ask of his 
enemies, '' Where now were all their

In the Germen Davidis of Gan%, translated into 
Latin by Vorstius, Lug. 1654, is an extract from a 
Hebrew MS. containing an account of Alroy. I sub- 
join a passage respecting his death for the learned 
reader. " Scribit R. Maimonides, Sultanum inter- 
rogasse ilium, num esset Messias, et dixisse^ Sum, et

" Septem annis ante decretum hoc, de quo supra

THE 



RISE OF ISKANDER. 



THE 



RISE OF ISKANDER. 



I. 



The Sun had set behind the mountains, 
and the rich plain of Athens was suffused 
with the violet glow of a Grecian eve. 
A light breeze rose ; the olive groves 
awoke from their noonday trance, and 
rustled with returning animation, and 
the pennons of the Turkish squadron, 
that lay at anchor in the harbour of 



Ill THE RISE 

Piraeus, twinkled in the lively air. From 
one gate of the city the women came 
forth in procession to the fountain ; from 
another, a band of sumptuous horsemen 
sallied out, and threw their wanton ja- 
velins in the invigorating- sky, as they 
galloped over the plain. The voice of 
birds, the buzz of beauteous insects, the 
breath of beauteous flowers, the quivering 
note of the nightingale, the pittering call 
of the grasshopper, and the perfume 
of the violet, shrinking from the embrace 
of the twilight breeze, filled the purple 
air with music and with odour. 

A solitary being stood upon the tower- 
ing crag of the Acropolis, amid the ruins 
of the Temple of Minerva, and g^zed 
upon the inspiring scene. Around him 
rose the matchless memorials of antique 
art ; immortal columns whose symmetry 



OF ISKANDER. 117 

baffles modern proportion, serene Cary- 
atides, bearing with greater grace a 
graceful burthen, carvings of delicate 
precision, and friezes breathing with 
heroic life. Apparently the stranger, 
though habited as a Moslemin, was not 
insensible to the genius of the locality, 
nor indeed would his form and counte- 
nance have misbecome a contemporary of 
Pericles and Phidias. In the prime 
of life, and far above the common stature, 
but with a frame, the muscular power of 
which was even exceeded by its almost 
ideal symmetry, his high white forehead, 
his straight profile, his oval countenance, 
and his curling lip, exhibited the same vi- 
sage that had inspired the sculptor of the 
surrounding' demigods. 

The dress of the stranger, although 
gorgeous, was, however, certainly not 



118 THE RISE 

classic. A crimson shawl was wound 
round his head, and glittered with a 
trembling- aigrette of diamonds. His 
vest, which set tight to his form, was of 
green velvet, richly embroidered with 
gold and pearls. Over this he wore a 
very light jacket of crimson velvet, 
equally embroidered, and lined with 
sable. He wore also the full white 
camese common among the Albanians ; 
and while his feet were protected by 
sandals, the lower part of his legs was 
guarded by greaves of embroidered green 
velvet. From a broad belt of scarlet 
leather peeped forth the jewelled hilts of 
a variety of daggers, and by his side 

• • • ' 

was an enormous scmiitar, m a scabbard 
of chased silver. 

The stranger gazed upon the wide 
prospect before him w ith an air of pen- 



OF ISKANDER. 119 

sive abstraction. " Beautiful Greece," 
he exclaimed, " thou art still my coun- 
try. A mournful lot is mine, a strange 
and mournful lot, yet not uncheered by 
hope. I am at least a warrior ; and this 
arm, though trained to war against thee 
will not well forget, in the quick hour of 
battle, the blood that flows within it. 
Themistocles saved Greece and died a 
Satrap : I am bred one — let me reverse 
our lots, and die at least a patriot." 

At this moment the Evening Hymn 
to the Virgin arose from a neighbouring 
convent. The stranger started as the 
sacred melody floated towards him, and 
taking a small golden cross from his 
heart, he kissed it with devotion, and 
then descending the steep of the citadel, 
entered the city. 

He proceeded along the narrow wind- 



IfiO THE RISE OF 

ing- streets of Athens until he at length 
arrived in front of a marble palace, in 
the construction of which the architect 
had certainly not consulted the sur- 
rounding models which Time had spared 
to him, but which, however it might 
have offended a classic taste, presented 
altogether a magnificent appearance. 
Half-a-dozen guards, whose shields and 
helmets somewhat oddly contrasted with 
two pieces of cannon, one of which was 
ostentatiously placed on each side of the 
portal, and which had been presented to 
the Prince of Athens by the Republic of 
Venice, lounged before the entrance, and 
paid their military homage to the stranger 
as he passed them. He passed them knd 
entered a large quadrangular garden, 
surrounded by arcades, supported by a 
considerable number of thin, low, pillars, 



OF ISKANDER. 121 

of barbarous workmanship, and various- 
coloured marbles. In the midst of the 
garden rose a fountain, whence the bub- 
bling waters flowed in artificial channels 
through vistas of orange and lemon trees. 
By the side of the fountain on a luxurious 
couch, his eyes fixed upon a richly -illu- 
minated volume, reposed Nicaeus, the 
youthful Prince of Athens. 

' ' Ah ! is it you ?" said the Prince look- 
ing up with a smile, as the stranger 
advanced. " You have arrived just in 
time to remind me that we must do 
something more than read the Persee — 
we must act it." 

" My dear Nicaeus," replied the stran- 
ger, " I have arrived only to bid you 
farewell." 

"Farewell I" exclaimed the Prince in 
a tone of surprise and sorrow, and he 

VOL. III. G 



122 THE RISE 

rose from the couch. " Why ! what is 
this ?" 

" It is too true/' said the stranger, 
and he led the way down one of the walks. 
" Events have occurred which entirely 
baffle all our plans and prospects, and 
place me in a position as difficult as it is 
harrowing. Hunniad es has suddenly 
crossed the Danube in great force, and 
carried every thing before him. I am 
ordered to proceed to Albania instantly, 
and to repair to the camp at the head of 
the Epirots." 

" Indeed !" said Nicaeus with a thought- 
ful air. '' My letters did not prepare me 
for this. Tis sudden ! Is Amurath him- 
self in the field ?" 

" No ; Karam Bey commands. I have 
accounted for my delay to the Sultan 
by pretended difficulties in our treaty, 



OF ISKANDER. 123 

and have held out the prospect of a 
larger tribute/* 

" When we are plotting that that tri- 
bute should be paid no longer !" added 
Nicaeus with a smile. 

" Alas ! my dear friend," replied the 
Turkish Commander ; " my situation has 
now become critical. Hitherto my ser- 
vices for the Moslemin have been con- 
fined to acting against nations of their 
own faith. I am now suddenly sum- 
moned to combat against my secret 
creed, and the best allies of what I must 
yet call my secret country. The move- 
ment, it appears to me, must be made 
now or never, and I cannot conceal from 
myself, that it never could have been pro- 
secuted under less auspicious circum- 
stances." 

" What, you desponding !" exclaimed 

G 2 



124 THE RISE 

Niceeus, " then I must despair. Your 
sanguine temper has alone supported 
me throughout all our dangerous hopes/' 

" And iEschylus ?" said the stranger 
smiling. 

" And iEschylus, certainly," replied 
Nicseus ; " but I have lived to find even 
iEschylus insipid. I pant for action." 

" It may be nearer than we can fore- 
see," replied the stranger. " There is a 
God who fashions all things. He will 
not desert a righteous cause. He know- 
eth that my thoughts are as pure as my 
situation is difficult. I have some dim 
ideas still brooding in my mind, but 
we will not discuss them now. I must 
away, dear Prince. The breeze 'serves 
fairly. Have you ever seen Hunniades?" 

" I was educated at the Court of Tran- 
sylvania," replied Nicseus, looking down 



OF ISKANDER. 125 

with a somewhat embarrassed air. " He 
is a famous knight, Christendom's chief 
bulwark." 

The Turkish Commander sighed. 
" When we meet again," he said, " may 
we meet with brighter hopes and more 
buoyant spirits. At present, I must, in- 
deed, say farewell." 

The Prince turned with a dejected 
countenance, and pressed his companion 
to his heart. " 'Tis a sad end," said he, 
*' to all our happy hours and lofty plans." 

" You are as yet too young to quarrel 
with fortune," replied the stranger, " and 
for myself, I have not yet settled my ac- 
counts with her. However, for the pre- 
sent, farewell, dear Nicseus !'* 

** Farewell," replied the Prince of 
Athens, '' Farewell, dear Iskander !" 



126 THE RISE 



II. 



Iskander was the youngest son of the 
Prince of Epirus, who, with the other 
Grecian Princes, had, at the commence- 
ment of the reign of Amurath the Second, 
in vain resisted the progress of the Turk- 
ish arms in Europe. The Prince of 
Epirus had obtained peace by yielding 
his four sons as hostages to the Turkish 
Sovereign, v^^ho engaged that they should 
be educated in all the accomplishments 
of their rank, and with a due deference 
to their faith. On the death of the 
Prince of Epirus, however, Amurath 
could not resist the opportunity that then 
offered itself of adding to his Empire the 
rich principality he had long coveted. 



OF ISKANDER. 1^ 

A Turkish force instantly marched into 
Epirus, and seized upon Croia, the ca- 
pital city, and the children of its late 
ruler were doomed to death. The beauty, 
talents, and valour of the youngest son, 
saved him, however, from the fate of his 
poisoned brothers. Iskander was edu- 
cated at Adrianople, in the Moslemin 
faith, and as he, at a very early age, 
excelled in feats of arms all the Moslemin 
warriors, he became a prime favourite of 
the Sultan, and speedily rose in his ser- 
vice to the highest rank. 

At this period the irresistible progress 
of the Turkish arms was the subject of 
alarm throughout all Christendom. 

Constantinople, then the capital of the 
Greek empire, had already been more 
than once besieged by the predecessors of 
Amurath, and had only been preserved 



128 THE RISE 

by fortunate accidents and humiliating 
terms. The Despots of Bosnia, Servia, 
and Bulgaria, and the Grecian princes of 
iEtolia, Macedon, Epirus, Athens, Pho- 
cis, Bceotia, and indeed of all the regions 
to the straights of Corinth, were tributa- 
ries to Amurath, and the rest of Europe 
was only preserved from his grasp by the 
valour of the Hungarians and the Poles, 
whom a fortunate alliance had now united 
under the sovereignty of Uladislaus, who, 
incited by the pious eloquence of the 
Cardinal of St. Angelo, the Legate of the 
Pope, and, yielding to the tears and 
supplications of the Despot of Servia, had, 
at the time our story opens, quitted Buda, 
at the head of an immense army, crossed 
the Danube, and, joining his valiant 
Viceroy, the famous John Hunniades, 
Vaivode of Transylvania, defeated the 



OF ISKANDER. IQD 

Turks with great slaughter, relieved all 
Bulgaria, and pushed on to the base of 
Mount Haemus, known in modern times 
as the celebrated Balkan. Here the 
Turkish General, Karam Bey, awaited 
the Christians, and hither to his assist- 
ance was Iskander commanded to repair 
at the head of a body of Janissaries, who 
had accompanied him to Greece, and the 
tributary Epirots. 

Had Iskander been influenced by vul- 
gar ambition, his loftiest desires might 
have been fully gratified by the career 
which Amu rath projected for him. Tlie 
Turkish Sultan destined for the Grecian 
Prince the hand of one of his daughters, 
and the principal command of his armies. 
He lavished upon him the highest digni- 
ties and boundless wealth ; and, whether 
it arose from a feeling of remorse, or of 

G 5 



130 THE RISE 

affection for a warrior, whose unexampled 
valour and unrivalled skill had already 
added some of the finest provinces of 
Asia to his rule, it is certain that Iskan- 
der might have exercised over Amurath 
a far greater degree of influence than was 
enjoyed by any other of his courtiers. 
But the heart of Iskander responded with 
no sympathy to these flattering favours. 
His Turkish education could never era- 
dicate from his memory the conscious- 
ness that he was a Greek ; and although 
he was brought up in the Moslemin faith, 
he had, at an early period of his career, 
secretly recurred to the creed of his 
Christian fathers. He beheld in Amu- 
rath the murderer of" his dearest kins- 
men, and the oppressor of his country ; 
and although a certain calmness of tem- 
per, and coolness of judgment, which 



OF ISKANDER. 131 

very early developed themselves in his 
character, prevented him from ever giving- 
any indication of his secret feelings, 
Iskander had long meditated on the ex- 
alted duty of freeing his country. 

Dispatched to Greece, to arrange the 
tributes and the treaties of the Grecian 
Princes, Iskander became acquainted 
with the young Nicaeus ; and their ac- 
quaintance soon matured into friendship. 
Niceeus was inexperienced ; but nature 
had not intended him for action. The 
young Prince of Athens would loll by 
the side of a fountain, and dream of the 
wonders of old days. Surrounded by his 
eunuchs, his priests, and his courtiers, he 
envied Leonidas, and would have emu- 
lated Themistocles. He was passionately 
devoted to the ancient literature of his 
country, and had the good taste, rare at 



132 THE RISE 

that time, to prefer Demosthenes and 
Lysias to Chrysostom and Gregory, and 
the choruses of the Grecian Theatre to 
the hymns of the Greek Church. The 
sustained energy and noble simplicity of 
the character of Iskander, seemed to re- 
call to the young Prince the classic he- 
roes, over whom he was so often musing, 
while the enthusiasm and fancy of Ni- 
caeus, and all that apparent weakness of 
will, and those quick vicissitudes of emo- 
tion, to which men of a fine susceptibility 
are subject, equally engaged the sympathy 
of the more vigorous and constant and 
experienced mind of his companion. 

To ISicaeus, Iskander had, for the first 
time in his life, confided much of his 
secret heart ; and the young Prince fired 
at the inspiring tale. Often they con- 
sulted over the fortunes of their country, 



OF ISKANDER. 133 

and, excited by their mutual invention, 
at length even dared to hope that they 
might affect its deliverance, when Iskan- 
der was summoned to the army. It was 
a mournful parting. Both of them felt 
that the last few months of their lives 
had owed many charms to their com- 
panionship. The parting of friends, 
united by sympathetic tastes, is always 
painful ; and friends, unless this sympa^ 
thy subsist, had much better never meet. 
Iskander stepped into the ship, sorrowful, 
but serene ; Nicseus returned to his pa- 
lace moody and fretful ; lost his temper 
with his courtiers, and, when he was 
alone, even shed tears. 



134> THE RISE 



III. 

Three weeks had elapsed since the 
parting of Iskander and Nicseus, when 
the former, at the head of ten thousand 
men, entered, by a circuitous route, the 
defiles of Mount Hsemus, and approached 
the Turkish camp, which had been 
pitched upon a vast and elevated table- 
ground, commanded on all sides by su- 
perior heights, which, however, were 
fortified and well garrisoned by Janissa- 
ries. The Epirots halted, and immedi- 
ately prepared to raise their tents, while 
their commander, attended by a few' of 
his officers, instantly proceeded to the 
pavilion of Karam Bey. 

The arrival of Iskander diffused ereat 



OF ISKANDER. 135 

joy among the soldiery ; and as he passed 
through the encampment, the exclama- 
tions of the Turkish warriors announced 
how ready they were to be led to the 
charge by a chieftain who had been 
ever successful. A guard of honour, by 
the orders of Karam Bey, advanced, to 
conduct Iskander to his presence ; and 
soon, entering the pavilion, the Grecian 
Prince exchanged courtesies with the 
Turkish General. After the formal com- 
pliments had passed, Karam Bey waved 
his hand, and the pavilion was cleared, 
with the exception of Mousa, the Chief 
Secretary, and favourite of Karam. 
" You have arrived in good time, Is- 
kander, to assist in the destruction of the 
Christian dog^/' said the Bey. "■ Flush- 
ed with their accursed success, they have 
advanced too far. Twice they have en- 



136 THE RISE 

deavoured to penetrate the mountains ; 
and each time they have been forced to 
retire, with great loss. The passages are 
well barricadoed with timber and huge 
fragments of rock. The dogs have lost 
all heart, and are sinking under the joint 
sufferings of hunger and cold. Our 
scouts tell me they exhibit symptoms of 
retreat. We must rush down from the 
mountains, and annihilate them." 

" Is Hunniades here in person ?" in- 
quired Iskander. 

'' He is here," replied Karam, " in per- 
son — the dog of dogs ! Come, Iskander, 
his head would be a fine Ramadan present 
to Amu rath. 'Tis a head worth three 
tails, I guess ?" 

Mousa, the chief secretary, indulged in 
some suppressed laughter at this joke. 
Iskander smiled. 



OF ISKANDER. 137 

** If they retreat we must assuredly at- 
tack them," observed Iskander, musingly. 
" I have a persuasion that Hunniades 
and myself will soon meet." 

''If there be truth in the Prophet !" 
exclaimed Karam, '' I have no doubt of 
it. Hunniades is reserved for you, Bey. 
We shall hold up our heads at court yet, 
Iskander. You have had letters lately ?" 

" Some slight words." 

" No mention of us, of course ?" 

" Nothing, except some passing praise 
of your valour and discretion." 

" We do our best, we do our best. 
Will Isa Bey have iEtolia, think you ?" 

" I have no thoughts. Our royal father 
will not forget his children, and Isa Bey 
is a most valiant chieftain.'' 

" You heard not that he was coming 
here }" inquired Karam. 



IS3 THE RISE 

" Have you ?" responded the cautious 
Iskander. 

'* A rumour, a rumour/' replied Ka- 
ram. " He is at Adrianople, think 
you ?" 

" It may be so : I am, you know, from 
Athens." 

'' True, true. We shall beat them, 
Iskander, we shall beat them." 

" For myself, I feel sanguine,** replied 
the Prince, and he arose to retire. " I 
must at present to my men. We must 
ascertain more accurately the movements 
of the Christians before we decide on our 
own. I am inclined myself to reconnoitre 
them. How far may it be ?" 

" There is not room to form our array 
between them and the mountains," re- 
plied Karam." 

" 'Tis well. Success attend the true 



OF ISKANDER. 139 

believers ! By to-morrow's dawn we shall 
know more." 



IV. 

Iskander returned to his men. Night 
was coming- on. Fires and lights blazed 
and sparkled in every direction. The air 
was clear but very cold. He entered his 
tent, and muffling himself up in his 
pelisse of sables, he mounted his horse, 
and declining any attendance, rode for 
some little distance, until he had escaped 
from the precincts of the camp. Then 
he turned his horse towards one of the 
wildest passes of the mountain, and gal- 
loping at great speed, never stopped 
until he had gained a considerable ascent. 
The track became steep and rugged. The 



140 THE RISE 

masses of loose stone rendered his pro- 
gress slow; but his Anatolian charger 
still bore him at intervals bravely, and 
in three hours' time he had gained the 
summit of Mount Haemus. A brilliant 
moon flooded the broad plains of Bul- 
garia with shadowy light. At the base 
of the mountainous range, the red watch- 
fires denoted the situation of the Chris- 
tian camp. 

Iskander proceeded down the descent 
with an audacious rapidity ; but his 
charger was thorough-bred, and his mo- 
ments were golden. Ere midnight, he 
had reached the outposts of the enemy, 
and was challeng-ed bv a sentinel. 

*' Who goes there ?" 

" A friend to Christendom." 

" The word ?" 

*' I have it not— nay, calmly. I am 



OF ISKANDER. 141 

alone, but I am not unarmed. I do not 
know the word. I come from a far 
country, and bear important tidings to 
the great Hunniades ; conduct me to that 
chief." 

" May I be crucified if I will,'^ re- 
sponded the sentinel, " before 1 know 
who and what you are. Come, keep off, 
unless you wish to try the effect of a 
Polish lance," continued the sentinel ; 
" 'tis something, I assure you, not less 
awkward than your Greek fire, if Greek 
indeed you be." 

"My friend, you are a fool," said Is- 
kander, " but time is too precious to 
argue any longer." So saying, the Turk- 
ish commander dismounted, and taking 
up the brawny sentinel in his arms with 
the greatest ease, threw him over his 
shoulder, and threatening the astounded

soldier with instant death if he struggled, 
covered him with his pelisse, and entered 
the camp. 

They approached a watch-fire, around 
which several soldiers were warming 
themselves. 

" Who goes there ?" inquired a second 
septinel. 

" A friend to Christendom," answered 
Iskander. 

'' The word ?" 

Iskander hesitated. 

" The word, or III let fly," said the 
sentinel, elevating his cross bow. 

" ' The Bridge of Buda,' " instantly 
replied the terrified prisoner beneath the 
pelisse of Iskander. 

" Why did not you answer before, 
then ?" said one of the guards. 

" And why do you mock us by chang- 



OF ISKANDER. 143 

ing your voice ?" said another. " Come, 
get on with you, and no more jokes." 

Iskander proceeded through a street of 
tents, in some of which were lights, but 
all of which were silent. At length, he 
met the esquire of a Polish knight re- 
turning from a convivial meeting, not a 
little elevated . 

" Who are you ?" inquired Iskander. 

" I am an Esquire," replied the gen- 
tleman. 

" A shrewd man, I doubt not, who 
would make his fortune," replied Iskan- 
der. " You must know great things 
have happened. Being on guard, I have 
taken a prisoner, who has deep secrets to 
divulge to the Lord Hunniades. Thither, 
to his pavilion, I am now bearing him. 
But he is a stout barbarian, and almost 
too much for me. Assist me in carrying 



14* THE RISE 

him to the pavilion of Hunniades, and 
you shall have all the reward and half 
the fame." 

*' You are a very civil spoken young 
gentleman," said the Esquire. '' I think 
I know your voice. Your name, if I mis- 
take not, is Leckinski ?"' 

" A relative. We had a common an- 
cestor.*' 

'' I thought so. I know the Leckins- 
kies ever by their voice. 1 am free to 
help you on the terms you mention — all 
the reward and half the fame. 'Tis a 
strong barbarianism, is it ? We cannot 
cut its throat, or it will not divulge. All 
the reward and half the fame ! I will be 
a Knight to-morrow. It seems a sort of 
fish, and has a smell." 

The Esquire seized the shoulders of the 
prisoner, who would have spoken had he 



OF ISKANDER. 145 

not been terrified by the threats of Is- 
kander, who, carrying the legs of the sen- 
tinel, allowed the Polish gentleman to 
lead the way to the pavilion of Hun- 
niades. Thither they soon arrived ; and 
Iskander, dropping his burthen, and 
leaving the prisoner without to the charge 
of his assistant, entered the pavilion of 
the General of the Hung-arians. 

He was stopped in a small outer apart- 
ment by an officer, who inquired his 
purpose, and to whom he repeated his 
desire to see the Hungarian leader, with- 
out loss of time, on important business. 
Tlie officer hesitated ; but, summoning 
several guards, left Iskander in their cus- 
tody, and, stepping behind a curtain, 
disappeared. Iskander heard voices, but 
could distinguish no words. Soon the 
officer returned, and, ordering the guards

146 THE RISE 

to disarm and search Iskander, directed 
the Grecian Prince to follow him. Draw- 
ing aside the curtain, L?kander and his 
attendant entered a low apartment of 
considerable size. It was hung with 
skins. A variety of armour and dresses 
were piled on couches. A middle-aged 
man, of majestic appearance, muffled up 
in a pelisse of furs, with long chestnut 
hair, and a cap of crimson velvet and 
ermine, was walking up and down the 
apartment, and dictating some instruc- 
tions to a person who was kneeling on 
the ground, and writing by the bright 
flame of a brazen lamp. The bright 
flame of the brazen lamp fell full upon 
the face of the Secretary. Iskander be- 
held a most beautiful woman. 

She looked up as Iskander entered. 
Her large dark eyes glanced through his 



OF ISKANDER. I47 

soul. Her raven hair descended to her 
shoulders in many curls on each side of 
her face, and was braided with strings of 
immense pearls. A broad cap of white 
fox-skin crowned her whiter forehead. 
Her features were very small, but sharply 
moulded, and a delicate tint gave ani- 
mation to her clear fair cheek. She 
looked up as Iskander entered, with an 
air rather of curiosity than embarrass- 
ment. 

Hunniades stopped, and examined his 
visitor with a searching inquisition. 
" Whence come you ?" inquired the 
Hungarian chieftain. 

'* From the Turkish camp," was the 
answer. 

*' An envoy or a deserter ?" 

'' Neither." 

^* What then >" 

H 2 



148 THE RISE 

" A convert." 

" Your name ?" 

" Lord Hunniades," said Iskander, 
" that is for your private ear. I am 
unarmed, and \yqvq I otherwise, the first 
knight of Christendom can scarcely fear. 
I am one in birth and rank your equal ; 
if not in fame, at least, I trust, in honour. 
My time is all-precious : I can scarcely 
stay here while my horse breathes. Dis- 
miss your attendant." 

Hunniades darted a glance at his visi- 
tor which would have baffled a weaker 
brain, but Iskander stood the scrutiny 
calm and undisturbed. " Go, Stanis- 
laus," said the Vaivode to the officer. 
" This lady. Sir," continued the chief- 
tain, " is my daughter, and one from 
whom I have no secrets." 

Iskander bowed lowly as the officer 
disappeared. 



OF ISKANDER. 149 

" And now," said Hunniades, " to 
business. Your purpose ?" 

" 1 am a Grecian Prince, and a com- 
pulsory ally of the Moslemin. In a 
word, my purpose here is to arrange a 
plan by which we may effect at the 
same time your triumph and my free- 
dom." 

" To whom, then, have I the honour of 
speaking ?" inquired Hunniades. 

" My name, great Hunniades, is per- 
haps not altogether unknown to you : 
they call me Iskander." 

" What, the right arm of Amurath, 
the conqueror of Caramania, the flower 
of Turkish chivalry ? Do I indeed be- 
hold that matchless warrior ?" exclaimed 
Hunniades, and he held forth his hand 
to his guest, and ungirding his own sword, 
offered it to the Prince. " Iduna," con- 



150 THE RISE 

tinued Hunniades, to his daughter, " you 
at length behold Iskander." 

" My joy is great, Sir," replied Iduna, 
" if I indeed rightly understand that we 
may count the Prince Iskander a cham- 
pion of the Cross." 

Iskander took from his heart his golden 
crucifix and kissed it before her. " This 
has been my companion and consolation 
for Icmg years, lady," said Iskander; 
'' you, perhaps, knovv my mournful his- 
tory, Hunniades. Hitherto my pre- 
tended sovereign has not required me to 
bare my scimitar against my Christian 
brethren. That hour, however, has at 
length arrived, and it has decided me to 
adopt a line of conduct long meditated. 
Karam Bey, who is aware of your neces- 
sities, the moment you commence your 
retreat, will attack you. I shall com- 



OF ISKANDER. 151 

mand his left wing. In spite of his 
superior power and position, draw up in 
array, and meet him with confidence. 
I propose, at a convenient moment in the 
day, to withdraw my troops, and with 
the Epirots hasten to my native country, 
and at once raise the standard of inde- 
pendence. It is a bold measure, but 
Success is the child of Audacity. We 
must assist each other with mutual diver- 
sions. Single-handed it is in vain for 
me to commence a struggle, which, with 
all adventitious advantages, will require 
the utmost exertion of energy, skill, and 
patience. But if yourself and the King 
Uladislaus occupy the armies of Amurath 
in Bulgaria, I am not without hope of 
ultimate success, since I have to inspire 
me all the most urgent interests of hu- 
manity, and combat, at the same time, 



152 THE RISE 

for my God, my country, and my lawful 
crown." 

" Brave Prince, I pledge you my 
troth," said Hunniades, coming forward 
and seizing his hand ; '* and while Iskan- 
der and Hunniades live, they will never 
cease until they have achieved their great 
and holy end." 

" It is a solemn compact," said Iskan- 
der, " more sacred than if registered by 
all the scribes of Christendom. Lady 
Iduna, your prayers !" 

" They are ever with the Champions 
of the Cross," replied the daughter of 
Hunniades. She rose, the large cloak in 
which she was enveloped fell from her 
exquisite form. " Noble Iskander,^ this 
rosary is from the Holy Sepulchre," con- 
tinued Iduna ; " wear it for the sake and 
memory of that blessed Saviour, who 
died for our sins." 



OF ISKANDER. 153 

Iskander held forth his arm and 
touched her delicate hand as he received 
the rosary, which, pressing to his lips, he 
placed round his neck. 

" Great Hunniades," said the Grecian 
Prince, '' I must cross the mountains be- 
fore dawn. Let me venture to entreat 
that we should hear to-morrow that the 
Christian camp is in retreat." 

" Let it be even so," said the Hunga- 
rian, after some thought, " and may to- 
morrow's Sun bring brighter days to 
Christendom." And with these words 
terminated the brief and extraordinary 
visit of Iskander to the Christian general. 



H o 



154 THE RISE 



V. 



The intelligence of the breaking up of 
the Christian camp, and the retreat of the 
Christian army, soon reached the Divan 
of Karam Bey, who immediately sum- 
moned Iskander to consult on the neces- 
sary operations. The chieftains agreed 
that instant pursuit was indispensable, 
and soon the savage Hsemus poured forth 
from its green bosom swarms of that 
light cavalry which was perhaps even a 
more fatal arm of the Turkish power than 
the famous Janissaries themselves. They 
hovered on the rear of the retreating 
Christians, charged the wavering, cap- 
tured the unwary. It was impossible to 
resist their sudden and impetuous move- 



•\ 



OP ISKANDER. 155 

ments, which rendered their escape as se- 
cure as their onset was overwhelming. 
Wearied at length by the repeated as- 
saults, Hunniades, who, attended by 
some chosen knights, had himself re- 
paired to the rear, gave orders for the 
army to halt and offer battle. 

Their pursuers instantly withdrew to a 
distance, and gradually forming into two 
divisions, awaited the arrival of the ad- 
vancing army of the Turks. The Mosle- 
min came forward in fierce array, and 
with the sanguine courage inspired by 
expected triumph. Very conspicuous 
^v'as Iskander bounding in his crimson 
vest upon his ebon steed, and waving 
his gleaming scimitar. 

The Janissaries charged, calling upon 
Allah ! with an awful shout. The Chris- 
tian knights, invoking the Christian 



156 THE RISE 

saints, received the Turks at the points 
of their lances. But many a noble lance 
was shivered that morn, and many a bold 
rider and worthy steed bit the dust of 
that field, borne down by the irresistible 
numbers of their fierce adversaries. 
Every where the balls and the arrows 
whistled through the air, and sometimes 
an isolated shriek heard amid the general 
clang, announced another victim to the 
fell and mysterious agency of the Greek 
fire. 

Hunniades, while he performed all the 
feats of an approved warrior, watched 
with anxiety the disposition of the Turk- 
ish troops. Hitherto, from the nature of 
their position, but a portion of both 
armies had interfered in the contest, and 
as yet, Iskander had kept aloof. But 
now, as the battle each instant raged 



OF ISKANDER. 157 

with more fury, and as it was evident 
that ere Ions: the main force of both 
armies must be brought into collision, 
Hunniades, with a terrible suspense, 
watched whether the Grecian Prince 
were willing, or even capable of exe- 
cuting his plan. Without this fulfil- 
ment, the Christian hero could not con- 
ceal from himself that the day must be 
decided against the Cross. 

In the mean time Iskander marked 
the course of events with not less eager- 
ness than Hunniades. Already Karam 
Bey had more than once summoned him 
to bring the Epirots into action. He 
assented ; but an hour passed away with- 
out changing his position. At length, 
more from astonishment than rage, the 
Turkish Commander sent his chief secre- 
tary Mousa himself to impress his wishes 



158 THE RISE 

upon his colleague, and obtain some ex- 
planation of his views and conduct. 
Mousa found Iskander surrounded by 
some of the principal Epirot nobles, 
all mounted on horseback, and standing 
calmly under a wide-spreading plane 
tree. The chief secretary of Karam Bey 
was too skilful a courtier to permit his 
countenance to express his feelings, and 
he delivered himself of his mission rather 
as if he had come to request advice, than 
to communicate a reprimand. 

" Your master is a wise man, Mousa," 
replied Iskander ; * ' but even Karam 
Bey may be mistaken. He deems that 
a battle is not to be won by loitering 
under a shadowy tree. Now I differ 
with him, and I even mean to win this 
day by such a piece of truancy. How- 
ever, it may certainly now be time for 



OF ISKANDER. 159 

more active work. You smile encou- 
ragement, good Mousa. Giorgio, Deme- 
trius, to your duty !" 

At these words, two stout Epirots 
advanced to the unfortunate Secretary, 
seized and bound him, and placed him on 
horseback before one of their comrades. 

" Now all who love their country fol- 
low me !" exclaimed Iskander. So say- 
ing, and at the head of five thousand 
horsemen, Iskander quitted the field at a 
rapid pace. 



VI. 

With incredible celerity Iskander and 
his cavalry dashed over the plains of 
Roumelia, and never halted except for 
short and hurried intervals of rest and 



160 THE RISE 

repose, until they had entered the moun- 
tainous borders of Epirus, and were 
within fifty miles of its capital, Croia. 
On the eve of entering the kingdom of 
his fathers, Iskander ordered his guards 
to produce the chief secretary of Karam 
Bey. Exhausted with fatigue, vexation, 
and terror, the disconsolate Mousa was 
led forward. 

" Cheer up, worthy Mousa !" said Is- 
kander, lying his length on the green 
turf. " We have had a sharp ride ; but 
I doubt not we shall soon find ourselves, 
by the blessing of God, in good quarters. 
There is a city at hand which they call 
Croia, and in which once, as the rumour 
runs, the son of my father shoi^ld 
not have had to go seek for an en- 
trance. No matter. Methinks, worthy 
Mousa, thou art the only man in our 



OF ISKANDER. l6l 

society that can sign thy name. Come 
now, write me an order signed Karam 
Bey to the Governor of this said city, for 
its dehvery up to the valiant Champion 
of the Crescent, Iskander, and thou shalt 
ride in future at a pace more suitable 
to a Secretary." 

The worthy Mousa humbled himself to 
the ground, and then taking his writing 
materials from his girdle, inscribed the 
desired order, and delivered it to Is- 
kander, who, glancing at the inscription, 
pushed it into his vest. 

" I shall proceed at once to Croia, with 
a few friends," said Iskander; '* do you, 
my bold companions, follow me this eve 
in various parties, and by various routes. 
At dead of the second night, collect in 
silence before the gates of Croia !" 

Thus speaking, Iskander called for his 



162 THE RISE 

now refreshed charger, and, accompanied 
by two hundred horsemen, bade farewell 
for a brief period to his troops, and soon 
having crossed the mountains, descended 
into the fertile plains of Epirus. 

When the Sun rose in the morning, 
Iskander and his friends beheld at the 
further end of the plain a very fine city 
shining in the light. It was surrounded 
with lofty turretted walls flanked by 
square towers, and was built upon a 
gentle eminence, which gave it a very 
majestic appearance. Behiad it rose a 
lofty range of purple mountains of very 
picturesque form, and the highest peaks 
capped with snow. A noble lake, from 
which troops of wild fowl occasionally 
rose, expanded like a sheet of silver on 
one side of the city. The green breast 
of the contiguous hills sparkled with 
white houses. 



OF ISKANDER. l63 

" Behold Croia!" exclaimed Iskander. 
" Our old fathers could choose a site, 
comrades. We shall see whether they 
expended their time and treasure for 
strangers, or their own seed." So say- 
ing, he spurred his horse, and with pant- 
ing hearts and smiling faces, Iskander 
and his company had soon arrived in the 
vicinity of the city. 

The city was surrounded by a beautiful 
region of corn-fields and fruit trees. The 
road was arched with the overhanging 
boughs. The birds chirped on every 
spray. It was a blithe and merry morn. 
Iskander plucked a bunch of olives as he 
cantered along. '* Dear friends,'' he said, 
looking round with an inspiring smile, 
** let us gather our first harvest !" And, 
thereupon, each putting forth his rapid 
hand, seized, as he rushed by, the em- 



164 THE RISE 

blem of possession, and following- the 
example of his leader, placed it in his 
cap. 

They arrived at the gates of the city, 
which was strongly garrisoned ; and Is- 
kander, followed by his train, galloped 
up the height of the citadel. Alighting 
from his horse, he was ushered into the 
divan of the Governor, an ancient Pacha, 
who received the conqueror of Caramania 
with all the respect that became so illus- 
trious a champion of the Crescent. After 
the usual forms of ceremonious hospita- 
lity, Iskander, with a courteous air, pre- 
sented him the order for delivering up 
the citadel ; and the old Pacha, resigning 
himself to the loss of his post with Orien- 
tal submission, instantly delivered ' the 
keys of the citadel and town to Iskander, 
and requested permission immediately to 
quit the late scene of his command. 



OF ISKANDER. 1^5 

Quitting the citadel, Iskander now 
proceeded through the whole town, and 
in the afternoon reviewed the Turkish 
garrison in the great square. As the late 
Governor was very anxious to quit Croia 
that very day, Iskander insisted on a con- 
siderable portion of the garrison accompa- 
nying him as a guard of honour, and 
returning the next morning. The rest 
he divided in several quarters, and placed 
the gates in charge of his own compa- 
nions. 

At midnight the Epirots, faithful to 
their orders, arrived and united beneath 
the walls of the city, and after inter- 
changing the signals agreed upon, the 
gates were opened. A large body in- 
stantly marched and secured the citadel. 
The rest, conducted by appointed leaders, 
surrounded the Turks in their quarters. 



i66 THE RISE 

And suddenly, in the noon of night, in 
that great city, arose a clang so dreadful 
that people leapt up from their sleep and 
stared with stupor. Instantly the ter- 
race of every house blazed with torches, 
and it became as light as day. Troops 
of armed men were charging down the 
streets, brandishing their scimitars and 
yataghans, and exclaiming, " The Cross, 
the Cross!"—" Liberty!"—'' Greece!" 
— " Iskander and Epirus !" The towns- 
men recognized their countrymen by their 
language and their dress. The name of 
Iskander acted as a spell. They stopt 
not to inquire. A magic sympathy at 
once persuaded them that this great man 
had, by the grace of Heaven, recurred to 
the creed and country of his fathers. And 
so every townsman, seizing the nearest 
weapon, with a spirit of patriotic frenzy, 



OF ISKANDER. iQj 

rushed into the streets, crying out " The 
Cross, the Cross ! Liberty ! Greece ! Is- 
kander and Epirus !" Ay ! even the 
women lost all womanly fears, and sti- 
mulated instead of soothing the impulse 
of their masters. They fetched them 
arms, they held the torches, they sent 
them forth with vows and prayers and 
imprecations, their children clinging to 
their robes, and repeating with enthu- 
siasm, phrases which they could not com- 
prehend. 

The Turks fought with the desperation 
of men, who feel that they are betrayed, 
and must be victims. The small and 
isolated bodies were soon massacred, all 
with cold steel, for at this time, although 
some of the terrible inventions of modern 
warfare were introduced, their use was 
not general. The citadel, indeed, was 



l68 THE RISE 

fortified with cannon ; but the greater 
part of the soldiery trusted to their 
crooked swords, and their unerring jave- 
lins. The main force of the Turkish 
garrison had been quartered in an old 
Palace of the Archbishop, situate in the 
middle of the city on a slightly rising 
and open ground, a massy building of 
rustic stone. Here the Turks, although 
surrounded, defended themselves despe- 
rately, using their cross-bows with ter- 
rible effect ; and hither, the rest of the 
city being now secured, Iskander himself 
repaired to achieve its complete deliver- 
ance. 

The Greeks had endeavoured to carry 
the principal entrance of the Palace by 
main force, but the strength of the portal 
had resisted their utmost exertions, and 
the arrows of the besieged had at length 



OF ISKANDER. l69 

forced them to retire to a distance. Is- 
kander directed that two pieces of cannon 
should be dragged down from the citadel, 
and then played against the entrance. 
In the meantime, he ordered immense 
piles of damp faggots to be lit before the 
building, the smoke of which prevented 
the besieged from taking any aim. The 
ardour of the people was so great, that the 
cannon were soon served against the pa- 
lace, and their effects were speedily re- 
marked. The massy portal shook ; a few 
blows of the battering ram, and it fell. 
The Turks sallied forth, were received 
with a shower of Greek fire, and driven 
in with agonizing yells. Some endea- 
voured to escape from the windows, and 
were speared or cut down ; some appeared 
wringing their hands in despair upon the 
terraced roof. Suddenly the Palace was 

VOL. III. I 



170 THE RISE 

announced to be on fire. A tall white 
blueish flame darted up from a cloud of 
smoke, and soon, as if by magic, the 
whole back of the building- was encom- 
passed with rising- tongues of red and 
raging light. Amid a Babel of shrieks, 
and shouts, and cheers, and prayers, and 
curses, the roof of the Palace fell in with 
a crash, which produced amid the be- 
siegers an awful and momentary silence, 
but in an instant they started from their 
strange inactivity, and rushing forward, 
leapt into the smoking ruins, and at the 
same time completed the massacre and 
achieved their freedom. 



OF ISKANDER. 1?^ 



VII. 

At break of dawn Iskander sent cou- 
:iers throughout all Epirus, announcing 
;he fall of Croia, and that he had raised 
;he standard of independence in his an- 
jient country. He also despatched a 
:rusty messenger to Prince Nicaeus at 
A-thens, and to the great Hunniades. 
Fhe people were so excited throughout all 
Epirus, at this great and unthoughtof in- 
telligence, that they simultaneously rose 
in all the open country, and massacred the 
lurks, and the towns were only restrained 
in a forced submission to Amurath, by 
the strong garrisons of the Sultan. 

Now Iskander was very anxious to effect 
the removal of these garrisons without 

I 2 



172 THE RISE 

loss of time, in order that if Amurath 
sent a great power against him, as he ex- 
pected, the invading army might have 
nothing to rely upon but its own force, 
and that his attention might not in any 
way be diverted from effecting their 
overthrow. Therefore, as soon as his 
troops had rested, and he had formed his 
new recruits into some order, which, with 
their willing spirits, did not demand 
many days, Iskander set out from Croia, 
at the head of twelve thousand men, and 
marched against the strong city of Pe- 
trella, meeting in his way the remainder 
of the garrison of Croia on their return, 
who surrendered themselves to him at 
discretion. Petrella was only one day's 
march from Croia, and when Iskander 
arrived there he requested a conference 
with the Governor, and told his tale so 



OF ISKANDER. 173 

well, representing the late overthrow ot 
the Turks by Hunniades, and the inca- 
pacity of Amiirath at present to relieve 
him, that the Turkish commander agreed 
to deliver up the place, and leave the 
country with his troops, particularly as 
the alternative of Iskander to these easy 
terms was ever conquest without quarter. 
And thus, by a happy mixture of auda- 
city and adroitness, the march of Iskan- 
der throughout Epirus, was rather like a 
triumph than a campaign, the Turkish 
garrisons imitating, without any excep- 
tion, the conduct of their comrades at 
Petrella, and dreading the fate of their 
comrades at the capital. In less than a 
month, Iskander returned to Epirus, 
having delivered the whole country from 
the Moslemin yoke. 

Hitherto Iskander had heard nothing 



'[J4> THE RISE 

either of Hunniades or Nicaeus. He 
learnt therefore with great interest as 
he passed through the gates of the city 
that the Prince of Athens had arrived 
at Croia the preceding eve, and also that 
his messenger had returned from the 
Hungarian camp. Amid the acclama- 
tions of an enthusiastic people, Iskander 
once more ascended the citadel of Croia. 
Nicaeus received him at the gate. Is- 
kander sprang from his horse, and em- 
braced his friend. Hand in hand, and 
followed by their respective trains, they 
entered the fortress palace. 

'' My dear friend, " said Iskander, 
when they were once more alone, " you 
see we were right not to despair. Two 
months have scarcely elapsed since we 
parted without a prospect, or with the 
most gloomy one, and now we are in 



OF ISKANDER. 175 

a fair way of achieving" all that we can 
desire. Epirus is free !" 

" I came to claim my share in its 
emancipation/* said Nicseus with a smile, 
" but Iskander is another Caesar !" 

"You will have many opportunities 
yet, believe me, Nicaeus, of proving- your 
courage and your patriotism," replied 
Iskander, " Amurath, will never allow 
this affair to pass over in this quiet man- 
ner. I did not commence this struggle 
without a conviction that it would demand 
all the energy and patience of a long 
life. I shall be rewarded if I leave free- 
dom as an heritage to my countrymen ; 
but for the rest, I feel that I bid fare- 
well to every joy of life, except the en- 
nobling consciousness of performing a 
noble duty. In the meantime, I under- 
stand a messenger awaits me here from

the great Hunniades. Unless that shield 
of Christendom maintain himself in his 
present position, our chance of ultimate 
security is feeble. With his constant 
divei*sion in Bulgaria, we may contrive 
here to struggle into success. You some- 
times laugh at my sanguine temper, Ni- 
cseus. To say the truth, I am more se- 
rene than sanguine, and was never more 
conscious of the strength of my opponent 
than now, when it appears that I have 
beaten him. Hark ! the people cheer. 
I love the people, Niceeus, who are ever 
influenced by genuine and generous 
feelings. They cheer as if they had 
once more gained a country. Alas! they 
little know what they must endure even 
at the best. Nay ! look not gloomy ; 
we have done great things, and will 
do more. Who waits without there ? 



OF ISKANDER. 177 

Demetrius ! Call the messenger from 
Lord Hunniades." 

An Epirot bearing- a silken packet was 
now introduced, which he delivered to 
Iskander. Reverently touching the hand 
of his chieftain, the messenger then 
kissed his own and withdrew. Iskander 
broke the seal, and drew forth a letter 
from the silken cover. 

" So ! this is well ! " exclaimed the 
Prince with great animation, as he threw 
his quick eye over the letter. *' As 1 
hoped and deemed, a most complete vic- 
tory. Karam Bey himself a prisoner, 
baggage, standards, great guns, treasure. 
Brave soldier of the Cross ! (may I 
prove so ! ) Your perfectly devised 
movement, (poh, poh !) Ilah ! what is 
this ?" exclaimed Iskander, turning pale ; 
his lip quivered, his eye looked dim. 

I o 



178 THE RISE 

He walked to an arched window. His 
companion, who supposed that he was 
reading-, did not disturb him. 

'* Poor, poor Hunniades!" at length 
exclaimed Iskander, shaking his head. 

" What of him?" inquired Nicseus 
quickly. 

" The sharpest accident of war !" re- 
plied Iskander. " It quite clouds my 
spirit. We must forget these things, we 
must forget. Epirus ! he is not a patriot 
who can spare a thought from thee. And 
yet, so young, so beautiful, so gifted, 
so worthy of a hero ! — when I saw her 
by her great father's side, sharing his 
toils, aiding his councils, supplying his 
necessities, methought I gazed upon a 
ministering angel ! —upon — " 

" Stop, stop in mercy's name, Iskan- 
der !" exclaimed Nicseus in a very agi- 



OF ISKANDER. 179 

tated tone. " What is all this ? Surely 
no,— surely not — surely Iduna — !" 

« 'Tis she !" 

" Dead ?'' exclaimed Nicaeus rushing- 
up to his companion, and seizing' his 
arm. 

" Worse, much worse !" 

" God of Heaven!" exclaimed the 
young Prince with almost a frantic air." 
Tell me all, tell me all ! This suspense 
fires my brain. Iskander, you know not 
what this woman is to me — the sole ob- 
ject of my being, the bane, the blessing 
of my life ! Speak, dear friend, speak ! 
I beseech you ! where is Iduna }'* 

" A prisoner to the Turk." 

'^ Iduna a prisoner to the Turk ! I'll 
not believe it ! Why do we wear swords } 
Where's chivalry ? Iduna, a prisoner to 
the Turk ! 'Tis false. It cannot be. 



180 THE RISE 

Iskander, you are a coward ! I am a 
coward 1 All are cowards ! A prisoner 
to the Turk ! Iduna ! What, the Rose 
of Christendom ! has it been plucked by 
such a turbaned dog as Amurath ? Fare- 
well, Epirus ! Farewell, classic Athens ! 
Farewell, bright fields of Greece, and 
dreams that made them brighter ! The 
Sun of all my joy and hope is set, and set 
for ever !" 

So saying, Nicaeus, tearing his hair 
and garments, flung himself upon the 
floor, and hid his face in his robes. 

Iskander paced the room with a trou- 
bled step and thoughtful brow. After 
some minutes he leant down by the 
Prince of Athens, and endeavoured to 
console him. 

*' It is in vain, Iskander, it is in vain," 
said Nicaeus. " I wish to die." 



OF ISKANDER. 181 

'* Were I a favoured lover, in such a 
situation," replied Iskander, " I should 
scarcely consider death my duty, unless 
the sacrifice of myself preserved ray mis- 
tress." 

" Hah !" exclaimed Nicseus, starting- 
from the ground. " Do you conceive, 
then, the possibility of rescuing her ?" 

" If she live, she is a prisoner in the 
Seraglio at Adrianople. You are as 
good a judge as myself of the prospect 
that awaits your exertions. It is, with- 
out doubt, a difficult adventure, but such, 
methinks, as a Christian knight should 
scarcely shun." 

** To horse," exclaimed Nicaeus, " to 

horse and yet what can I do ? Were 

she in any other place but the capital 1 
might rescue her by force, but in the 
heart of their empire — it is impossible. 



182 THE RISE 

Is there no ransom that can tempt the 
Turk ? My principality would rise in 
the balance beside this jewel." 

" That were scarcely wise, and cer- 
tainly not just," replied Iskander ; '* but 
ransom will be of no avail. Hunniades 
has already offered to restore Karam Bey, 
and all the prisoners of rank, and the 
chief trophies, and Amurath has refused 
to listen to any terms. The truth is, 
Id una has found favour in the eyes of his 
son, the young Mahomed." 

" Holy Virgin ! hast thou no pity on 
this Christian maid ?" exclaimed Nicseus. 
"The young Mahomed! Shall this 
licentious infidel — ah ! Iskander, dear, 
dear Iskander, you who have so much 
wisdom, and so much courage ; you who 
can devise all things, and dare all things ; 
help me, help me ; on my knees I do, be- 



OF ISKANDER. 183 

seech you, take up this crying cause of 
foul oppression, and for the sake of all 
you love and reverence — ^j^our creed, 
your country, and perchance your friend, 
let your great genius, like some solemn 
angel, haste to the rescue of the sweet 
Id una, and save her, save her I" 

" Some thoughts like these were rising 
in my mind when first I spoke," replied 
Iskander. '' This is a better cue, far more 
beseeming Princes than boyish tears, and 
all the outward misery of woe, a tat- 
tered garment and dishevelled locks. 
Come, Niceeus, we have to struggle with 
a mighty fortune. Let us be firm as Fate 
itself." 



184 THE RISE 



VIII. 

Immediately after his interview with 
Nicaeus, Iskander summoned some of the 
chief citizens of Croia to the citadel, and 
submitting to them his arrangements for 
the administration of Epirus, announced 
the necessity of his instant departure for 
a short interval ; and the same evening, 
ere the moon had risen, himself and the 
Prince of Athens quitted the city, and 
proceeded in the direction of Adrianople. 
They travelled with great rapidity until 
they reached a small town upon the fron- 
tiers, where they halted for one day. 
Here, in the Bazaar, Iskander purchased 
for himself the dress of an Armenian 
physician. In his long dark robes,, and 



OF ISKANDER. 185 

large round cap of black wool, his face 
and hands stained, and his beard and 
mustachios shaven, it seemed impossible 
that he could be recognized. Nicaeus 
was habited as his page, in a dress of 
coarse red cloth, setting tight to his 
form, with a red cap, with a long blue 
tassel. He carried a large bag contain- 
ing drugs, some surgical instruments, 
and a few books. In this guise, as soon 
as the gates were open on the morrow, 
Iskander, mounted on a very small mule, 
and Nicaeus on a very large donkey, the 
two Princes commenced the pass of the 
mountainous range, an arm of the Balkan 
which divided Epirus from Roumelia. 

" I broke the wind of the finest charger 
in all Asia when I last ascended these 
mountains," said Iskander ; "1 hope this 
day's journey may be accepted as a sort 
of atonement." 



186 THE RISE 

" Faith ! there is little doubt I am the 
best mounted of the two," said Nicseus. 
*' However, 1 hope we shall return at a 
sharper pace." 

" How came it, my Niceeus," said Is- 
kander, " that vou never mentioned to 
me the name of Iduna when we were at 
Athens ? I little supposed when I made 
my sudden visit to Hunniades, that I was 
about to appeal to so fair a host. She is a 
rarely gifted lady." 

'* I knew of her being at the camp as 
little as yourself,'' replied the Prmce of 
Athens, " and for the rest, the truth is, 
Iskander, there are some slight crosses in 
our loves which Time, I hope, will fashion 
rightly." So saying, Niceeus pricked on 
his donkey, and flung his stick at a bird 
which was perched on the branch of a 
tree. Iskander did not resume a' topic 



OF ISKANDER. 18? 

to which his companion seemed disin- 
clined. Their journey was tedious. To- 
wards nightfall they reached the summit 
of the usual track ; and as the descent 
was difficult, they were obliged to rest 
until day-break. 

On the morrow they had a magnificent 
view of the rich plains of Roumelia, and 
in the extreme distance, the great city of 
Adrianople, its cupolas and minarets 
blazing and sparkling in the Sun. This 
glorious prospect at once revived all their 
energies. It seemed that the moment of 
peril and of fate had arrived. They 
pricked on their sorry steeds ; and on the 
morning of the next day, presented them- 
selves at the gates of the city. The tho- 
rough knowledge which Iskandcr pos- 
sessed of the Turkish character, obtained 
them an entrance, which was at one time 



188 THE RISE 

almost doubtful, from the irritability and 
impatience of Nicseus. They repaired 
to a caravansera of good repute in the 
neighbourhood of the Seraglio ; and hav- 
vinof eno-a^ed their rooms, the Armenian 
physician, attended by his page, visited 
several of the neigbouring coffee-houses, 
announcing, at the same time, his arrival, 
his profession, and his skill. 

As Iskander felt pulses, examined 
tongues, and distributed drugs and 
charms, he listened with interest and 
amusement to the conversation of which 
he himself was often the hero. He found 
that the Turks had not yet recovered 
from their consternation at his audacity 
and success. They were still wondering, 
and if possible more astounded than in- 
dignant. The politicians of the coffee- 
houses, chiefly consisting of Janissaries, 



OF ISKAXDER. 189 

were loud in their murmurs. The popu- 
larity of Amu rath had vanished before 
the triumph of Hunniades, and the rise 
of Iskander. 

" But Allah has in some instances 
favoured the faithful," remarked Iskan- 
der ; " I heard in my travels of your 
having captured a great princess of the 
Giaours ?" 

" God is great !" said an elderly Turk 
with a long white beard. '* The Hakim 
congratulates the faithful because they 
have taken a woman !" 

'* Not so, merely," replied Iskander ; 
" I heard the woman was a Princess. If 
so, the people of Franguestan will pay any 
ransom for their great women ; and, by 
giving up this fair Giaour, you may free 
many of the faithful." 

" Mashallah !" said another ancient 



190 THE RISE 

Turk, sipping" his coffee. " The Hakim 
speaks wisely." 

'• May I murder my mother !" ex- 
claimed a young Janissary, with gr ea 
indignation. " But this is the very 
thing that makes me wild against Amu- 
rath. Is not this Princess a daughter of 
that accursed Giaour, that dog of dogs, 
Hunniades ? and has he not offered for 
her ransom, our brave Karam Bey him- 
self, and his chosen warriors ? and has 
not Amurath said Nay ? And why has 
he said Nay ? Because his son, the Prince 
Mahomed, instead of fighting against 
the Giaours, has looked upon one of their 
women, and has become a Mejnoun. 
Pah ! May I murder my mother, — but 
if the Giaours were in full march to the 
city, I'd not fight. And let him tell 
this to the Cadi who dares; for, there 



OF ISKANDER. igi 

are ten thousand of us, and we have 
sworn by the Kettle — but we will 
not fight for Giaours, or those who love 
Giaours !" 

" If you mean me, Ali, about going to 
the Cadi," said the chief eunuch of Ma- 
homed, who was standing by, *' let me tell 
you I am no tale-bearer, and scorn to do 
an unmanly act. The young Prince can 
beat the Giaours without the aid of those 
who are noisy enough in a coffee-house, 
when they are quiet enough in the 
field. And, for the rest of the business, 
you may all ease your hearts ; for the 
Frangy Princess you talk of, is pining 
away, and will soon die. The Sultan has 
offered a hundred purses of gold to any 
one who cures her : but the sold will 
never be counted by the Hasnadar, or 
I will double it." 



19^ THE RISE 

" Try your fortune, Hakim," said se- 
veral laughing" loungers to Iskander. 

" Allah has stricken the Frangy Prin- 
cess," said the old Turk with a white 
beard. 

" He will strike all Giaours," said his 
ancient companion, sipping his coffee. 
" Tis so written." 

" Well ! I do not like to hear of wo- 
men-slaves pining to death," said tlie 
young Janissary, in a softened tone, 
" particularly when they are young. 
Amu rath should have ransomed her, or he 
might have given her to one of his offi- 
cers, or any young fellow that had par- 
ticularly distinguished himself" And so, 
twirling his mustachios, and flinging 
down his piastre, the young Janissary 
strutted out of the coffee-house. 

" When we were young," said th6 old 



OF ISKANDER. 193 

Turk with the white beard to his com- 
panion, shaking- his head, " when we 
were young " 

'* We conquered Anatolia, and never 
opened our mouths," rejoined his com- 
panion. 

" I never offered an opinion till I was 
sixty," said the old Turk ; " and then it 
was one which had been in our family 
for a century/' 

*' No wonder Hunniades carries every 
thing before him," said his companion. 

" And that accursed Iskander," said 
the old man. 

The chief Eunuch, finishing his vase of 
sherbet, moved away. The Armeniau 
Physician followed him. 



VOL III. 



19i * THE RISE 



IX. 

The chief Eunuch turned into a burial- 
ground, through which a way led, by an 
avenue of cypress-trees, to the quarter 
of the Seraglio. The Armenian physi- 
cian, accompanied by his page, followed 
him. 

" Noble Sir !" said the Armenian phy- 
sician ; " may I trespass for a moment on 
your Lordship's attention ?" 

" Worthy Hakim, is it you ?" replied 
the chief Eunuch, turning round with an 
encouraoing smile of courteous conde- 
scension, — " your pleasure ?" 

" I would speak to you of important 
matters," said the Physician. 

The Eunuch carelessly seated himself 



OF ISKANUER. IQo 

on a richly carved tomb, and crossing his 
legs with an air of pleasant superiority, 
adjusted a fine emerald that sparkled on 
his finger, and bade the Hakim address 
him without hesitation. 

** I am a Physician," said the Arme- 
nian. 

The Eunuch nodded. 
" And I heard your Lordship in the 
coffee-house mention that the Sultan, our 
sublime Master, had off*ered a rich re- 
ward to any one who could effect the 
cure of a favourite captive.'* 

" No less a reward than one hundred 
purses of gold,'' remarked the Eunuch. 
" The reward is proportioned to the ex- 
igency of the case. Believe me, worthy 
Sir, it is desperate." 

** With mortal means," replied the Ar- 
menian ; *' but I possess a talisman of 

k2 



196 THE RISE 

magical influence, which no disorder 
can resist. I would fain try its effi- 
cacy." 

*' This is not the first talisman that has 
been offered us, worthy Doctor," said the 
Eunuch, smiling incredulously. 

" But the first that has been offered on 
these terms,*' said the Armenian. " Let 
me cure the captive, and of the one 
hundred purses, a moiety shall belong to 
youi'self. Ay! so confident am 1 of suc- 
cess, that I deem it no hazard to com- 
mence our contmct by this surety." And 
so saying, the Armenian took from his 
finger a gorgeous carbuncle, and offered 
it to the Eunuch. The worthy dependant 
of the Seraglio had a great tast in jewel- 
lery. He examined the stone with ad- 
miration, and placed it on his finger with 
complacency. " I require no induce- 



OF ISKAXDER. 197 

ments to promote tlie interests of science, 
and the purposes of charity," said the Eu- 
nuch, with a patronizing- air. *' 'Tis 
assuredly a pretty stone, and, as the me- 
morial of an ing-enious stranger, whom 
I respect, I shall, with pleasure, retain 
it. You were saying something about a 
talisman. xVre you serious? I doubt 
not that there are means which might 
obtain you the desired trial ; but the 
Prince INIahomed is as violent when dis- 
pleased or disappointed as munificent 
when gratified. Cure this Christian cap- 
tive, and we may certainly receive the 
promised purses: fail, and your head ^will 
as assuredly be flung into the Seraglio 
moat, to say nothing of my own." 

" Most noble Sir !" said the Physician ; 
" I am willing- to undertake the experi- 
ment on the terms you mention. Rest 



198 THE RISE 

assured that the patient, if alive, must, 
with this remedy, speedily recover. You 
marvel ! Believe me, had you witnessed 
the cures which it has already eflfected, 
you would only wonder at its otherwise 
incredible influence." 

" You have the advantage," replied the 
Eunuch, " of addressing a man who has 
seen something of the world. I travel 
every year to Anatolia with the Prince 
Mahomed. Were I a narrow-minded 
bigot, who had never been five miles 
from Adrianople in the whole course of 
my life, I might indeed be sceptical. But 
I am a patron of science, and have heard 
of talismans. How much mi^-ht this rinsj 
-weigh, think you ?" 

*' I have heard it spoken of as a car- 
buncle of uncommon size," replied the 
Armenian. 



OF ISKANDER. 199 

*' Where did you say you lodged, Ha- 
kim ?'• 

'* At the Khan of Bedreddin." 

'* A very proper dwelling. Well, we 
shall see. Have you more jewels ? I 
might, perhaps, put you in the way of 
parting with some at good prices. The 
Khan of Bedreddin is very conveniently 
situated. 1 may, perhaps, towards even- 
ing, taste your coffee at the Khan of Bed- 
reddin, and we will talk of this said 
talisman. Allah be with you, worthy 
Hakim !" The Eunuch nodded, not 
without encouragement, and went his 
way. 

" Anxiety alone enabled me to keep 
my countenance," said Nicaeus. " A 
patron of science, forsooth 1 Of all the 
insolent, shallow-brained, mpacious cox- 
combs " 



^00 THE RISE 

" Hush, my friend !" said Iskander, 
with a smile. " The chief Eunuch of the 
heir apparent of the Turkish empire is a 
far greater man than a poor prince, or a 
proscribed rebel. This worthy can do 
our business, and I trust will. He clearly 
bites, and a richer bait will, perhaps, se- 
cure him. In the meantime, we must be 
patient, and remember whose destiny is 
at stake." 



X. 



The chief Eunuch did not keep the ad- 
venturous companions long in suspence ; 
for, before the Muezzin had announced 
the close of day from the minaret^, he 
had reached the Khan of Bedreddin, and 
inquired for the Armenian physician. 



OF ISKAXUER. (201 

** We have no time to lose," said the 
Eunuch to Iskander. " Brino' ^vith vou 
whatever you may require, and follow 
me." 

The Eunuch led the way, Iskander and 
NicfEus maintaining" a respectful distance. 
After proceeding down several streets, 
they arrived at the burial-ground, where 
they had conversed in the morning ; and 
when they had entered this more retired 
spot, the Eiuuich fell back, and addressed 
his companion. 

*' Now, worthy Hakim," he said, " if 
you deceive me f will never patronize a 
man of science again. I found an oppor- 
tunity of speaking to the Prince this af- 
ternoon of your talisman, and he has 
taken from my representations such a 
fancy for its immediate proof, that T found 
it quite impossible to postpone its trial 



202 THE RISE 

even until to-morrow. I mentioned the 
terms. I told the Prince your life was 
the pledge. I said nothing of the moiety 
of the reward, worthy Hakim. That is 
an affair between ourselves. I trust to 
your honour, and I always act thus with 
men of science." 

" I shall not disgrace my profession 
or your confidence, rest assured," re- 
plied Iskander. " And am I to see the 
captive this night ?" 

'' I doubt it not. Are you prepared ? 
We might, perhaps, gain a little time, if 
very necessary." 

" By no means, Sir ; Truth is ever 
prepared " 

1 bus conversing, they passed through 
the burial-ground, and approached some 
high, broad walls, forming a terrace, and 
planted with young sycamore-trees. The 



OF ISKANDER. 203 

Eunuch tapped, with his silver stick, at a 
small gate, which opened, and admitted 
them into a garden, full of large clumps 
of massy shrubs. Through these a wind- 
ing walk led for some way, and then 
conducted them to an open lawn, on 
which was situate a vast and irregular 
building. As they approached the pile, a 
young man of very imperious aspect 
rushed forward from a gate, and abruptly 
accosted Iskander. 

" Are you the Armenian Physician ?" 
he inquired. 

Iskander bowed assent. 

" Have you got your talisman ? You 
know the terms ? Cure this Christian 
girl and you shall name your own re- 
ward; fail, and I shall claim your forfeit 
head." 

" The terms are well understood, 



204 THE RISE 

mighty Prince," said Iskander, for the 
young man was no less a personage than 
the son of Amurath, and future con- 
queror of Constantinople ; " but I am 
confident there will be no necessity for 
the terror of Christendom claiming any 
other heads than those of his enemies." 

" Kaflis will conduct you at once to 
your patient," said Mahomed. " For 
myself, I cannot rest until 1 know the 
result of your visit. I shall wander about 
these gardens, and destroy the flowers, 
which is the only pleasure now left me." 

Kaflis motioned to his companions to 
advance, and they entered the Seraglio. 

At the end of a long gallery they came 
to a great portal, which Kaflis opened, 
and Iskander and Niceeus for a moment 
supposed that they had arrived at the 
chief hall of the Tower of Babel, but they 



OF ISKANDER. '205 

found the shrill din only proceeded from 
a large company of women, who were 
employed in distilling the rare atar of 
the jasmine flower. All their voices 
ceased on the entrance of the strangers, as 
if by a miracle ; but when they had ex- 
amined them, and observed that it was 
only a Physician and his boy, their awe, 
or their surprise, disappeared ; and they 
crowded round Iskander, some holding 
out their wrists, others lolling out their 
tongues, and some asking questions, which 
perplexed alike the skill and the modesty 
of the adventurous dealer in magical me- 
dicine. The annoyance, however, was 
not of great duration, for Kaflis so be- 
laboured their fair shoulders with his ofii- 
cial baton, that they instantly retreated 
with precipitation, uttering the most vio- 
lent shrieks, and bestowing on the Eunuch 



206 THE RISE 

SO many titles, that Iskander and his 
pag-e were quite astounded at the intui- 
tive knowledge which the imprisoned 
damsels possessed of that vocabulary of 
abuse, which is in general mastered only 
by the experience of active existence. 

Quitting this chamber, the Eunuch and 
his companions ascended a lofty staircase. 
They halted, at length, before a door. 
" This is the chamber of the tower," said 
their guide, " and here we shall find the 
fair captive." He knocked, the door was 
opened by a female slave, and Iskander 
and Nic8eus, with an anxiety they could 
with difficulty conceal, were ushered into 
a small but sumptuous apartment. In 
the extremity was a recess covered with 
a light gauzy curtain. The Eunuch bid- 
ding- them keep in the back-ground, ad- 
vanced, and cautiously withdrawing the 



OF ISKANDER. 207 

curtain slightly aside, addressed some 
words in a low voice to the inmate of the 
recess. In a few minutes the Eunuch 
beckoned to Iskander to advance, and 
whispered to him : ** She would not at 
first see you, but I have told her you are 
a Christian, the more the pity, and she 
consents." So saying, he withdrew the 
curtain, and exhibited a veiled female 
figure lying on a couch. 

*' Noble lady," said the Physician in 
Greek, which he had ascertained the 
Eunuch did not comprehend ; " pardon 
the zeal of a Christian friend. Though 
habited in this garb, I have served under 
your illustrious Sire. I should deem my 
life well spent in serving the daughter of 
the great Hunniades." 

*' Kind stranger," replied the captive, 
'* I was ill-prepared for such a meeting. 



208 THE RISE 

I thank you for your sympathy, but my 
sad fortunes are beyond human aid/' 

" God works by humble instruments, 
noble lady," said Iskander, " and with 
his blessing we may yet prosper." 

*' I fear that I must look to death as 
my only refug-e," replied Iduna, '* and 
still more, I fear that it is not so present 
a refuge as my oppressoi's themselves 
imagine. But you are a physician ; tell 
me then how speedily Nature will make 
me free." 

She held forth her hand, which Iskan- 
der took and involuntarily pressed. *' No- 
ble lady," he said, " my skill is a mere 
pretence to enter these walls. The only 
talisman I bear with me is a messas^e 
from vour friends." 

" Indeed !" said Iduna, in a very agi- 
tated tone. 



OF ISK.\NDER. 209 

" Restrain yourself, noble lady," said 
Iskander, interposing, " restrain yourself. 
Were you any other but the daughter of 
Hunniades 1 would not have ventured 
upon this perilous exploit. But I know 
that the Lady Id una has inherited some- 
thing more than the name of her great 
ancestors — their heroic soul. If ever there 
were a moment in her lile in which it 
behoved her to exert all her ener2fies, that 
moment has arrived. The physician who 
addresses her, and his attendant who 
waits at hand, are two of the Lady Idu- 
na's most devoted friends. There is no- 
thing that they will not hazard, to effect 
her delivery ; and they have matured a 
plan of escape which they are sanguine 
must succeed. Yet its completion will 
require, on her part, great anxiety of 
mind, greater exertion of body, danger, 



210 THE RISE 

fatig-ue, privation. Is the Lady Iduua 
prepared for all this endurance, and all 
this hazard ?" 

" Noble friend,'* replied Iduna, " for 
I cannot deem you a stranger, and none 
but a most chivalric knight could have 
entered upon this almost forlorn adven- 
ture ; you have not, I trust, miscalculated 
my character. I am a slave, and unless 
heaven will interpose, must soon be a dis- 
honoured one. My freedom and my fame 
are alike at stake. There is no danger, 
and no suffering which I will not gladly 
welcome, provided there be even a remote 
chance of regaining my liberty and se- 
curing my honour." 

'* You are in the mind I counted on. 
Now, mark my words, dear Lady. Seize 
an opportunity this evening of expressing 
to your gaolers that you have already ex- 



OF ISKANDER. £H 

perienced some benefit from my visit, 
and announce your rising* confidence in 
my skill. In the meantime I will make 
such a report that our daily meetings 
will not be difficult. For the present, 
farewell. The Prince Mahomed waits 
without, and I would exchange some 
words with him before I go." 

" And must we part without my being 
acquaiated with the generous friends to 
whom I am indebted for an act of devo- 
tion which almost reconciles me to my 
sad fate?" said Iduna. '* You will not, 
perhaps, deem the implicit trust reposed 
in you by one whom you have no interest 
to deceive, and who, if deceived, cannot 
be placed in a worse position than she at 
present fills, as a very gratifying mark of 
confidence, yet that trust is reposed in 
you ; and let me, at least, sooth the gall-

the recollection of the friends to whom I 
am indebted for a deed of friendship 
which has filled me ^vith a feeling of 
wonder from which 1 have not yet re- 
covered." 

*' The person who has penetrated the 
Seraglio of Constantinople in disguise to 
rescue the Lady Iduna," answered 
Iskander, " is the Prince Niceeus." 

" Nicaeus !" exclaimed Iduna, in an 
agitated tone. " The voice to which I 
listen is surely not that of the Prince 
Nicaeus ; nor the form on which I gaze/* 
she added, as she unveiled. Beside her 
stood the tall figure of the Armenian 
physician. She beheld his swarthy and 
unrecognized countenance. She cast her 
dark eyes around with an air of beautiful 
perplexity. 



OF ISKANDER. 219 

*' I am a friend of the Prince ?^icoeus," 
said the Physician. " He is here. Shall 
he advance ? Alexis," called out Iskan- 
der, not waiting for her reply. The page 
of the Physician came forward, but the 
Eunuch accompanied him. " All is 
right," said Iskander to Kaflis. " We 
are sure of our hundred purses. But, 
without doubt, with any other aid, the 
case were desperate." 

" There is but one God," said tlie 
Eunuch, polishing his carbuncle, with 
a visage radiant as the gem. " I never 
repented patronizing men of science. The 
Prince waits without. Come along !" 
He took Iskander by the arm. " Where 
is your boy ? What are you doing there, 
Sir ?" inquired the Eunuch, sharply, of 
Nicaeus, who was tarrying behind, and 
kissing the hand of Iduna. 

" I was asking the lady for a favour

Nicaeus, with pouting- lips ; " you forget 
that I am to have none of the hundred

** True/* said the Eunuch ; " there is 
something in that. Here, boy, here is a 
piastre for you. I like to encourage 
men of science, and all that belong to 
them. Do not go and spend it all in one 
morning, boy, and when the fair captive 
is cured, if you remind me, boy, perhaps 
I may give you another."

Kaflis and his charge again reached 
the garden. The twilight was nearly 
past. A horseman galloped up to them, 
followed by several running footmen. It 
was the Prince.

" Well, Hakim," he inquired, in his 
usual abrupt style, " can you cure her ?" 

" Yes," answered Iskander, firmly. 

" Now listen, Hakim," said Mahom- 
ed. "I must very shortly leave the 
city, and proceed into Epirus at the 
head of our troops. I have sworn two 
things, and I have sworn them by the 
holy stone. Ere the new moon, I will 
have the heart of Iduna and the head of 
Iskander !" 

The Physician bowed. 

" If you can so restore the health of 
this Frangy girl," continued Mahomed, 
" that she may attend me within ten 
days into Epirus, you shall claim from 
my treasury what sum you like and be- 
come Physician to the Seraglio. Wliat 
say you ?" 

" My hope and my belief is," replied 



216 TUK RISE 

Iskander, " that within ten days she 
may breathe the air of Epirus." 

*' By my father's beard, you are a man 
after my own heart," exclaimed the 
Prince ; " and since thou dealest in 
talismans, Hakim, can you give me a 
charm that will secure me a meeting 
with this Epirot rebel within the term, 
so that I may keep my oath. What say 
you ? — what say you ?" 

" There are such spells,'' replied Iskan- 
der. " But mark, I can only secure the 
meeting, not the head." 

" That is my part," said Mahomed, 
with an arrogant sneer. " But the 
meeting, the meeting ?" 

" You know the Fountain of Kallista 
in Epirus. Its virtues are renowned." 

" I have heard of it." 

" Plunge your scimitar in its mid-

night waters thrice, on the eve of the 
New Moon, and each time summon the 
enemy you would desire to meet. He 
will not fail you." 

*' If you cure the captive, I will credit 
the legend, and keep the appointment," 
replied Mahomed, thoughtfully. 

** I have engaged to do that," replied 
the Physician. 

" Well, then, I shall redeem my 
pledge," said the Prince. 

** But mind," said the Physician, 
** while I engage to cure the lady and 
produce the warrior, I can secure your 
Highness neither the heart of the ont 
nor the head of the other." 

" Tis understood," said Mahomed.

The Armenian Physician did not fail 
to attend his captive patient at an early 
hour on the ensuing morn. His patron 
Kaflis received him with an encouraging 
smile. " The talisman already works," 
said the Eunuch : " she has past a good 
night, and confesses to an improvement. 
Our purses are safe. JMethinks I already 
count the gold. But I say, worthy 
Hakim, come hither, come hither," and 
Kaflis looked around to be sure that no 
one was within hearing. " I say," and 
here he put on a very mysterious air in- 
deed, " the Prince is generous : you un- 
derstand } We go shares. We shall not 
quarrel. I never yet repented pa- 



OF ISKANDER. 219 

tronizing a man of science, and I am 
sure I never shall. The Prince you see is 
violent, but generous. I would not cure 
her too soon, eh ?" 

" You take a most discreet view of 
affairs," responded Iskander, with an air 
of complete assent, and they entered the 
chamber of the tower. 

Iduna performed her part with great 
dexterity ; but indeed it required less 
skill than herself and her advisers had at 
first imagined. Her malady, although it 
might have ended fatally, was in its ori- 
gin entirely mental, and the sudden 
prospect of freedom, and of restoration to 
her country and her family, at a moment 
when she had delivered herself up to 
despair, afforded her a great and instan- 
taneous benefit. She could not indeed 
sufficiently restrain her spirits, and smiled 

L 2 



220 THE RISE 

incredulously when Iskander mentioned 
the impending- exertion and fatignes with 
doubt and apprehension. His anxiety to 
return immediately toEpirus, determined 
him to adopt the measures for her rescue 
without loss of time, and on his third 
visit, he prepared her for making the 
great attempt on the ensuing morn. 
Hitherto Iskander had refrained from re- 
vealing himself to Iduna. He was in- 
duced to adopt this conduct by various 
considerations. He could no longer con- 
ceal from himself that the daughter of 
Hunniades exercised an influence over 
his feelings which he was unwilling to 
encourage. His sincere friendship for 
Niceeus, and his conviction that it was 
his present duty to concentrate all his 
thought and affection in the cause of 
his country, would have rendered him 



OF ISKANDER. 221 

anxious to have resisted any emotions of 
the kind, even could he have flattered 
himself that there was any chance of their 
being- returned by the object of his rising 
passion. But Iskander was as modest as 
he was brave and gifted. The disparity 
of age between himself and Iduna ap- 
peared an insuperable barrier to his 
hopes, even had there been no other 
obstacle. Iskander struggled with his 
love, and with his strong mind the strug- 
gle, though painful, was not without 
success. He felt that he was acting in a 
manner which must ultimately tend to 
the advantage of his country, the happi- 
ness of his friend, and perhaps the main- 
tenance of his own self-respect. For he 
had too much pride not to be very sen- 
sible to the bitterness of rejection. 

Had he perceived more indications of 



222 THE RISE 

a very cordial feeling subsisting between 
Nicgeus and Iduna, he would perhaps 
not have persisted in maintaining his 
disguise. But he had long suspected 
that the passion of the Prince of Athens 
was not too favourably considered by the 
daughter of Hunniades, and he was 
therefore exceedingly anxious that Ni- 
caeus should possess all the credit of the 
present adventure, which Iskander scarcely 
doubted, if successful, would allow Ni- 
caeus to urge irresistible claims to the 
heart of a mistress whom he had rescued 
at the peril of his life from slavery and 
dishonour, to offer rank, reputation, and 
love. Iskander took, therefore, several 
opportunities of leading Iduna to believe 
that he was merely a confidential .agent 
of Nicseus, and that the whole plan of her 
rescue from the Seraglio of Adrianople 



OF ISKANDER. 223 

had been planned by his young friend. 
In the mean time, during the three days 
on which they had for short intervals met, 
very few words had been interchanged 
between Nicaeus and his mistress. Those 
words, indeed, had been to him of the 
most inspiring nature, and expressed such 
a deep sense of gratitude, and such Uvely 
regard, that Nicaeus could no longer resist 
the delightful conviction that he had at 
length created a permanent interest in 
her heart. Often he longed to rush to 
her couch, and press her hand to his lips. 
Even the anticipation of future happi- 
ness could not prevent him from envying 
the good fortune of Iskander, who was 
allowed to converse with her without 
restraint ; and bitterly, on their return to 
the khan, did he execrate the pompous 
Eunuch for all the torture which he 



224 THE RISE 

occasioned him by his silly conversation, 
and the petty tyranny of office with 
which Kaflis always repressed his at- 
tempts to converse for a moment with 
Iduna. 

In the mean time all Adrianople 
sounded with the preparations for the 
immediate invasion of Epirus, and the 
return of Iskander to his country became 
each hour more urgent. Every thing 
being prepared, the adventurers deter- 
mined on the fourth morning to attempt 
the rescue. They repaired as usual to 
the Serail, and were attended by Kaflis to 
the chamber of the tower, who congra- 
tulated Iskander on their way on the 
rapid convalescence of the captive. When 
they had fairly entered the chamber, the 
Physician being somewhat in advance, 
Nicaeus, who was behind, commenced pro- 



OF ISKANDER. 225 

ceedings by knocking down the Eunuch, 
and Iskander instantly turning round to 
his assistance, they succeeded in g^agging 
and binding the alarmed and astonished 
Kaflis. Iduna then habited hei-self in a 
costume exactly similar to that worn by 
Niceeus, and which her friends had 
brought to her in their bag. Iskander 
and Iduna then immediately quitted the 
Serail without notice or suspicion, and 
hurried to the khan, where they mounted 
their horses, that were in readiness, and 
hastened without a moment's loss of time 
to a fountain without the gates, where 
they waited the arrival of Nicaeus with 
anxiety. After remaining a few minutes 
in the chamber of the tower, the Prince 
of Athens stole out, taking care to secure 
the door upon Kaflis. He descended the 
staircase, and escaped through the Serail 

l5 



iifi THE RISE 

without meeting any one, and had nearly 
reached the gate of the gardens, when he 
was challenged by some of the eunuch 
guard at a little distance. 

" Hilloa \" exclaimed one, *' I thought 
you passed just now ?*' 

** So I did," replied Niceeus with ner- 
vous effrontery ; *' but I came back for 
my bag, which I left behind," and giving 
them no time to reflect, he pushed his 
way through the gate with all the impu- 
dence of a page. He rushed through the 
burial ground, hurried through the streets, 
mounted his horse, and galloped through 
the gates. Iskander and Iduna were in 
sight, he waved his hand for them at 
once to proceed, and in a moment, with- 
out exchanging a word, they were all 
galloping at full speed, nor did they 
breathe their horses until sunset. 



OF ISKANDER. Hgf 

By nightfall they had reached a small 
wood of chestnut trees, where they rested 
for two hours, more for the sake of their 
steeds than their own refreshment, for 
anxiety prevented Iduna from indulging 
in any repose, as much as excitement 
prevented her from feeling any fatigue. 
Iskander lit a fire and prepared their 
rough meal, unharnessed the horses, and 
turned them out to their pasture. Ni- 
caeus made Iduna a couch of fern, and 
supported her head, while, in deference to 
his entreaties, she endeavoured in vain to 
sleep. Before midnight they were again 
on their way, and proceeded at a rapid 
pace towards the mountains, until a few 
hours before noon, when their horses 
began to sink under the united influence 
of their previous exertions and the in- 
creasing heat of the day. Iskander looked 



228 THE RISE 

serious, and often threw a backward glance 
in the direction of Adrianople. 

" We must be beyond pursuit," said 
Nicaeus. " I dare say poor Kaflis is still 
gagged and bound." 

" Could we but once reach the moun- 
tains," replied his companion, " I should 
have little fear, but I counted upon our 
steeds carrying us there without faltering. 
We cannot reckon upon more than three 
hours' start. Prince. Our friend Kaflis 
is too important a personage to be long 
missed." 

" The holy Virgin befriend us !" said 
the Lady Iduna. " I can urge my poor 
horse no more." 

They had now ascended a small rising 
ground, which gave them a wide pros- 
pect over the plain. Iskander halted and 
threw an anxious glance around him. 



OF ISKANDER. j!29 

** There are some horsemen in the dis- 
tance whom I do not like," said the Phy- 
sician. 

*' I see them," said Nicseus ; " travel- 
lers like ourselves." 

** Let us die sooner than be taken," 
said Iduna. 

" Move on," said the Physician, " and 
let me observe these horsemen alone. I 
would there were some forest at hand. 
In two hours we may gain the moun- 
tains." 

The daughter of Hunniades and the 
Prince of Athens descended the rising 
ground. Before them, but at a consi- 
derable distance, was a broad and rapid 
river, crossed by a ruinous Roman bridge. 
The opposite bank of the river was the 
termination of a narrow plain, which led 
immediately to the mountains. 



2.30 THE RISE 

" Fair Iduna, you are safe," said the 
Prince of Athens. 

" Dear Niceeus," replied his compa- 
nion, " imagine what I feel. It is too 
wild a moment to express my gratitude." 

" I trust that Iduna will never express 
her gratitude to Nicaeus," answered the 
Prince ; " it is not, I assure you, a fa- 
vourite word with him." 

Their companion rejoined them, urg- 
ing his wearied horse to its utmost speed. 

" Nicaeus !*' he called out, " halt !" 

They stopped their willing horses. 

" How now ! my friend ;" said the 
Prince ; " you look grave ?" 

" Lady Iduna !" said the Armenian, 
*' we are pursued." 

Hitherto the prospect of success, ^and 
the consciousness of the terrible destiny 
that awaited failure, had supported Iduna 



OF ISKANDER. 231 

under exertions, which under any other 
circumstances must have proved fatal. 
But to learn, at the very moment that 
she was congratulating- herself on the fe- 
licitous completion of their daring- enter- 
prise, that that dreaded failure was abso- 
lutely impending-, demanded too great 
an exertion of her exhausted energies. 
She turned pale; she lifted up her im- 
ploring hands and eyes to heaven in 
speechless agony, and then bending down 
her head, wept with unrestrained and 
harrowing violence. The distracted Ni- 
cseus sprung from his horse, endeavoured 
to console the almost insensible Iduna, 
and then woefully glancing at his fellow 
adventurer, wrung his hands in despair. 
His fellow adventurer seemed lost in 
thought. 

" They come," said Nicaeus, starting ; 



232 THE RISE 

" methinks I see one on the brow of the 
hill. Away ! fly ! Let us at least die 
fighting. Dear, dear Iduna, would that 
my life could ransom thine. O God ! 
this is indeed agony." 

'* Escape is impossible," said Iduna, in 
a tone of calmness which astonished them. 
" They must overtake us. Alas ! brave 
friends, I have brought ye to this ! 
Pardon me, pardon me ! I am ashamed 
of my selfish grief. Ascribe it to other 
causes than a narrow spirit and a weak 
mind. One course is alone left to us. 
We must not be taken prisoners. Ye are 
warriors, and can die as such. I am only 
a woman, but I am the daughter of 
Hunniades. Nicoeus, you are my father's 
friend ; I beseech you sheathe your dag- 
ger in my breast." 

The Prince in silent agony pressed his 



OF ISKANDER. 233 

hands to his sight. His limbs quivered 
with terrible emotion. Suddenly he ad- 
vanced and threw himself at the feet of 
his hitherto silent comrade. ** Oh ! Is- 
kander!'* exclaimed Nicaeus, '* great and 
glorious friend ! my head and heart are 
both too weak for these awful trials — 
save her, save her 1" 

" Iskander !" exclaimed the thunder- 
struck Iduna. *' Iskander !" 

" I have, indeed, the misfortune to be 
Iskander, beloved lady," he replied. 
" This is, indeed, a case almost of despe- 
ration, but if I have to endure more than 
most men, I have, to inspire me, influ- 
ences which fall to the lot of few — your- 
self and Epirus. Come ! Nicaeus, there is 
but one chance — we must qriin the bridge.* 
Thus speaking, Iskander caught Iduna 
in his arms, and remounting his steeds 



234 THE RISE 

and followed by the Prince of Athens, 
hurried towards the river. 

" The water is not fordable/* said Is- 
kander, when they had arrived at its 
bank. " The bridge I shall defend ; and 
it will go hard if I do not keep them at 
bay long- enough for you and Iduna to 
gain the mountains. Away ; think no 
more of me ; nay ! no tear, dear lady, or 
you will unman me. An inspiring smile, 
and all will go well. Hasten to Croia, 
and let nothing tempt you to linger in 
the vicinity, with the hope of my again 
joining you. Believe me, we shall meet 
again, but act upon what I say, as if they 
were my dying words. God bless you, 
Nicaeus ! No murmuring. For once let 
the Physician, indeed, command his page. 
Gentle lady, commend me to your fa- 
ther. Would I had such a daughter in 



OF ISKANDER. 235 

Epirus, to head my trusty brethren if I 
fall ! Tell the great Hunniades, my le- 
gacy to him is my country. Farewell, 
farewell !" 

'' I will not say farewell," exclaimed 
Iduna, *' I too can fight. I will stay and 
die with you." 

" See they come ! Believe me I shall 
conquer. Fly, fly, thou noble girl! 
Guard her well, Nicaeus. God bless 
thee, boy ! Live and be happy. Nay, 
nay, not another word. The farther ye 
are both distant, trust me, the stronger 
will be my arm. Indeed, indeed, I do 
beseech ye, fly 1" 

Niceeus placed the weeping Iduna in 
her saddle, and after leading her horse 
over the narrow and broken bridge, 
mounted his own, and then they ascended 
together the hilly and winding track. 



236 THE RISE 

Iskander watched them as they went. 
Often Iduna waved her kerchief to her 
forlorn champion. In the meantime 
Iskander tore off his Armenian robes and 
flung them into the river, tried his foot- 
ing on the position he had taken up, 
stretched his limbs, examined his dag- 
gers, flourished his scimitar. 

The bridge would only permit a single 
rider to pass abreast. It was supported 
by three arches, the centre one of very 
considerable size, the others small, and 
rising out of the shallow water on each 
side. In many parts the parapet wall 
was broken, in some even the pathway 
was almost impassable from the masses 
of fallen stone, and the dangerous fissures. 
In the centre of the middle arch was an 
immense key-stone, on which was sculp- 
tured, in high relief, an enormous hel- 



OF ISKANDER. 237 

met, which indeed gave, among the 
people of the country, a title to the 
bridge. 

A band of horsemen dashed at full 
speed, with a loud shout, down the hill. 
They checked their horses, when to their 
astonishment they found Iskander with 
his drawn scimitar, prepared to resist 
their passage. But they paused only for 
a moment, and immediately attempted 
to swim the river. But their exhausted 
horses drew back with a strong instinct 
from the rushing waters : one of the 
band alone, mounted on a magnificent 
black mare, succeeding in his purpose. 
The rider was half-way in the stream, his 
high-bred steed snorting and struggling 
in the strong current. Iskander, with 
the same ease as if he were plucking the 
ripe fruit from a tree, took up a pon- 



238 THE RISE 

derous stone, and hurled it with fatal 
precision at his adventurous enemy. The 
rider shrieked and fell, and rose no more : 
the mare, relieved from her burthen, ex- 
erted all her failing energies, and suc- 
ceeded in gaining the opposite bank. 
There, rolling herself in the welcome 
pasture, and neighing with a note of 
triumph, she revelled in her hard escape. 

** Cut down the Giaour !" exclaimed 
one of the horsemen, and he dashed at 
the bridge. His fragile blade shivered 
into a thousand pieces as it crossed the 
scimitar of Iskander, and in a moment 
his bleeding head fell over the parapet. 

Instantly the whole band, each emu- 
lous of revenging his comrades, rushed 
without thought at Iskander, and endea- 
voured to overpower him by their irre- 
sistible charge. His scimitar flashed like 



OF ISKANDER. 239 

lig-htning. The two foremost of his ene- 
mies fell, but the impulse of the numbers 
prevailed, and each instant, although 
dealing" destruction with every blow, he 
felt himself losing ground. At length he 
was on the centre of the centre arch, an 
eminent position, Avhich allowed him for 
a moment to keep them at bay, and gave 
him breathing time. Suddenly he made 
a desperate charge, clove the head of the 
leader of the band in two, and beat them 
back several yards ; then swiftly return- 
ing to his former position, he summoned 
all his supernatural strength, and stamp- 
ing on the mighty, but mouldering* key- 
stone, he forced it from its form, and 
broke the masonry of a thousand years. 
Amid a loud and awful shriek, horses and 
horsemen, and the dissolving fragments 
of the scene for a moment mingled as 



240 THE RISE 

it were in airy chaos, and then plunged 
with a horrible plash into the fatal depths 
below. Some fell, and, stunned by the 
massy fragments, rose no more ; others 
struggled again into light, and gained 
with difficulty their old shore. Amid 
them, Iskander, unhurt, swam like a 
river God, and stabbed to the heart the 
only strong swimmer that was making 
his way in the direction of Epirus. 
Drenched and exhausted, Iskander at 
length stood upon the opposite margin, 
and wranghis garments, while he watched 
the scene of strange destruction. 

Three or four exhausted wretches were 
lying bruised and breathless on the op- 
posite bank : one drowned horse was 
stranded near them, caught by the rushes. 
Of all that brave company the rest had 
vanished, and the broad, and blue, and 



OF ISKANDER. 241 

sunny waters rushed without a shadow 
beneath the two remaining- arches. 

'* Iduna ! thou art safe," exclaimed 
Iskander. " Now for Epirus !" So say- 
ing", he seized the black mare, renovated 
by her bath and pasture, and vaulting on 
her back, was in a few minutes bounding 
over his native hills. 



XIII. 

In the meantime let us not forget the 
Prince of Athens and the Lady Iduna. 
These adventurous companions soon lost 
sight of their devoted champion, and en- 
tered a winding ravine, which gradually 
' brought them to the summit of the fii*st 
chain of the Epirot mountains. From it 
they looked down upon a vast and rocky 

VOL. 111. M 



242 THE RISE 

valley, through which several mule tracks 
led in various directions, and entered the 
highest barrier of the mountains which 
rose before them, covered with forests of 
chestnut and ilex. Niceeus chose the 
track which he considered least tempting 
to pursuit, and towards sunset they had 
again entered a ravine washed by a 
mountain stream. The course of the 
waters had made the earth fertile and 
beautiful. Wild shrubs of gay and plea- 
sant colours refreshed their wearied eye- 
sight, and the perfume of aromatic plants 
invigorated their jaded senses. Upon 
the bank, too, of the river a large cross of 
roughly carved wood brought comfort to 
their Christian hearts, and while the 
holy emblem filled them with hope and 
consolation, and seemed an omen of re- 
fuge from their Moslemin oppressors, a 



OF ISKANDER. 24-3 

venerable Eremite, with a long white 
beard descending over his dark robes, 
and leaning on a statf of thorn, came 
forth from an adjoining cavern to breathe 
the evening air and pour forth his even- 
ing orisons. 

Iduna and Niceeus had hitherto prose- 
cuted their sorrowful journey almost in 
silence. Exhausted with anxiety, afHic- 
tion, and l)odily fatigue, with diliiculty 
the daughter of Hunniades could pre- 
serve her seat upon her steed. One 
thought alone interested her, and by its 
engrossing influence maintained her 
under all her sufferings — the memory ot 
Iskander. Since she first met him, at 
the extraordinary interview in her father"? 
pavilion, often had the image of the hero 
recurred to her fancy, often had she 
mused over his great qualities and strange 

M 2 



244 THE RISE 

career. His fame, so dangerous to female 
hearts, was not diminished by his pre- 
sence. And now, when Iduna re- 
collected that she was indebted to him 
for all that she held dear, that she owed 
to his disinterested devotion, not only 
life, but all that renders life desirable, — 
honour and freedom, country and kin- 
dred, — that image was invested with asso- 
ciations and with sentiments, which, had 
Iskander himself been conscious of their 
existence, would have lent redoubled vi- 
gour to his arm, and fresh inspiration to 
his energy. More than once Iduna had 
been on the point of inquiring of Nicaeus 
the reason which had induced alike him 
and Iskander to preserve so strictly the 
disguise of his companion. But a feel- 
ing which she did not choose to analyze, 
struggled successfully with her curiosity : 



S 



OF ISKANDER. 21o 

she felt a reluctance to speak of Iskandcr 
to the Prince of Athens. In the mean- 
time Niceeus himself was not apparently 
very anxious of conversing upon the sul)- 
ject, and after the first rapid expressions 
of fear and hope as to the situation of 
their late comrade, they relapsed into 
silence, seldom broken by Nicaeus, but to 
deplore the sufferings of his mistress, — 
lamentations which Iduna answered with 
a faint smile. 

The refreshing scene wherein they had 
now entered, and the cheering appearance 
of the Eremite were subjects of mutual 
congratulation, and Niceeus, somewhat 
advancing, claimed the attention of the 
holy man, announcing their liaith, im- 
prisonment, escape, and sufferings, and 
entreating hospitality and refuge. The 
Eremite pointed with his staff to the 



246 THE RISE 

winding- path, which ascended the bank 
of the river to the cavern, and welcomed 
the pilgrims in the name of their blessed 
Saviour to his wild abode and simple 
fare. 

The cavern widened when they en- 
tered, and comprised several small apart- 
ments. It ■ was a work of the early 
Christians, who. had found a refuge in 
their days of persecution, and Art had 
completed the beneficent design of Na- 
ture. The cavern was fresh, and sweet, 
and clean. Heaven smiled upon its 
pious inmate through an aperture in the 
roof; the floor was covered with rushes; 
in one niche rested a brazen cross, and in 
another a perpetual lamp burnt before a 
picture, where Madonna smiled / with 
meek tenderness upon her young" Divi- 
nity. 



OF ISKANDER. ^47 

The Eremite placed upon a block of 
wood, the surface of which he had hiiixself 
smoothed, some honey, some dried fish, 
and a wooden bowl filled with the pure 
stream that flowed beneath them : a sim- 
ple meal but welcome. His guests seated 
themselves upon a rushy couch, and 
while they refreshed themselves, he gently 
inquired the history of their adventures. 
As it was evident that the Eremite, from 
her apparel, mistook the sex of Iduna, 
Nicaeus thought fit not to undeceive him, 
but passed her off as his brother. He 
described themselves as two Athenian 
youths, who had been captured while 
serving as volunteers under the great 
Hunniades, and who had efi^ected their 
escape from Adrianople under circum- 
stances of great peril and difficulty ; and 
when he had gratified the Eremite's 



248 THE RISE 

curiosity respecting their Christian bre- 
thren in Paynim lands, and sympatheti- 
cally marvelled with him at the advancing 
fortunes of the Crescent, Nicaeus, who 
perceived that Iduna stood in great need 
of rest, mentioned the fatigues of his 
more fragile brother, and requested per- 
mission for him to retire. Whereupon 
the Eremite himself, fetching a load of 
fresh rushes, arranged them in one of the 
cells, and invited the fair Iduna to repose. 
The daughter of Hunniades first hum- 
bling herself before the altar of the Vir- 
gin, and offering her gratitude for all the 
late mercies vouchsafed unto her, and 
then bidding a word of peace to her 
host and her companion, withdrew to 
her hard-earned couch, and soon, was 
buried in a sleep as sweet and innocent as 
herself. 



OF ISKANDER. 249 

But repose fell not upon the eye-lids of 
Nicreus in spite of all his labours. The 
heart of the Athenian Prince was dis- 
tracted by the two most powerful of 
passions — Love and Jealousy — and when 
the Eremite, pointing out to his guest his 
allotted resting-place, himself retired to 
his resiiilar and simple slumbers, Niceeus 
quitted the cavern, and standing upon the 
bank of the river, gazed in abstraction 
upon the rushing waters foaming in the 
moonlight. The Prince of Athens, with 
many admirable qualities, was one of 
those men who are influenced only by 
their passions, and who, in the aflairs of 
life, are invariably guided by their ima- 
gination instead of their reason. At pre- 
sent all thought and feeling, all consider- 
ations, and all circumstances, merged in 
the overpowering love he entertained for

250 THE RISE 

Iduna, his determination to obtain her at 
all cost and peril, and his resolution that 
she should never again meet Iskaiider, 
except as the wife of Nicaeus. Compared 
with this paramount object, the future 
seemed to vanish. The emancipation of 
his country, the welfare of his friend, 
even the maintenance of his holy creed, all " 
those great and noble objects for Avhich, 
under other circumstances, he would have 
been prepared to sacrifice his fortune and 
his life, no longer interested or influenced 
him ; and while the legions of the Cres- 
cent were on the point of pouring into 
Greece to crush that patriotic and Chris- 
tian cause over which Iskander and him- 
self had so often mused, whose interests 
the disinterested absence of Iskander, oc- 
casioned solely by his devotion to Ni- 
caeus, had certainly endangered, and per- 



OF ISKANDER. 251 

haps, could the events of the last few 
hours be known, even sacrificed, the 
Prince of Alliens resolved, unless Iduna 
would consent to become his, at once to 
carry off tlie daug^hter of Hunniades to 
some distant country. Nor indeed, even 
with his easily excited vanity, was Ni- 
caeus sanguine of obtaining- his purpose 
by less violent means. He was already a 
rejected suitor, and under circumstances 
which scarcely had left hope. Nothing' 
but the sole credit of her chivalric rescue 
could perhaps have obtained for him the 
interest in the heart of Iduna which he 
coveted. For while this exploit proffered 
an irresistible claim to her deepest grati- 
tude, it indicated also, on the part of her 
deliverer, the presence and possession of 
all those great qualities, the absence of 
which in the character and conduct ci' 



252 THE RISE 

her suitor, Iduna had not, at a former 
period, endeavoured to conceal to be the 
principal cause of his rejection. And 
now, by the unhappy course of circum- 
stances, the very deed on which he count- 
ed, with sanguine hope, as the sure means 
of his success, seemed as it were to have 
placed him in a still inferior situation 
than before. The constant society of his 
mistress had fanned the flame which, 
apart from her and hopeless, he had en- 
deavoured to repress, to all its former 
force and ardour ; while, on the other 
handj he could not conceal from himself, 
that Iduna must feel that he had played 
in these great proceedings but a second- 
ary part ; that all the genius and all the 
generosity of the exploit rested with Is- 
kander, who, after having obtained her 
freedom by so much energy, peril, saga-

OF ISKANDER. 253 

city and skill, had secured it by a de- 
voted courage which might shame all the 
knights of Christendom, perhaps, too, 
had secured it by his own life. 

What if Iskander were no more ? It 
was a great contingency. The eternal 
servitude of Greece, and the shameful 
triumph of the Crescent, were involved, 
perhaps, in that single event. And could 
the possession of Iduna compensate for 
such disgrace and infamy ? Let us not 
record the wild response of passion. 

It was midnight ere the restless Nicaeus, 
more exhausted by his agitating reverie, 
than by his previous exertions, returned 
into the cavern, and found refuge in 
sleep from all his disquietudes. 



2o4> THE RISE 



XIV. 

The Eremite rose with the Sun ; and 
while he was yet at matins, was joined 
by Iduna, refreshed and cheerful after 
her unusual slumbers. After performing 
their devotions, her venerable host pro- 
posed that they should g-o forth and en- 
joy the morning air. So, descending the 
precipitous bank of the river, he led the 
way to a small glen, the bed of a tribu- 
tary rivulet, now nearly exhausted. 
Beautiful clumps of birch-trees, and tall 
thin poplars, rose on each side among 
the rocks which were covered with bright 
mosses, and parasitical plants of gay and 
various colours. One side of the glen 
was touched with the golden and grateful 



OF ISKANDER. 255 

beams of the rising- Sun, and the other 
was in deep shadow. 

" Here you can enjoy nature and free- 
dom in security ;" said the Eremite, "for 
your enemies, if they have not already 
given up their pursuit, will scarcely 
search this sweet solitude/* 

'* It is indeed sweet, holy father," said 
Iduna ; " but the captive, who has es- 
caped from captivity, can alone feel all 
its sweetness.*' 

*' It is true," said the Eremite ; " I 
also have been a captive." 

" Indeed ! holy father. To the Infi- 
dels ?" 

" To the Infidels, ^-entle pilgrim." 

" Have you been at Adrianople ?" 

" My oppressors were not the Paynim," 
replied the Eremite, '' but they were 
enemies far more dire — my own evil pas- 



2,56 THE RISE 

sions. Time was when my eye sparkled 
like thine, j^entle pilgrim, and my heart 
was not as pure/' 

" God is merciful," said Iduna, " and 
without his aid, the strongest are but 
shadows." 

" Ever think so," replied the Eremite, 
'' and you will deserve rather his love 
than his mercy. Thirty long years have 
I spent in this solitude, meditating upon 
the past, and it is a theme yet fertile in 
instruction. My hours are never heavy, 
and Memory is to me what Action is to 
other men," 

'• You have seen much, holy father ?*' 

" And felt more. Yet you will per- 
haps think the result of all my experience 
very slight, for I can only say unto thee, 
trust not in thyself." 

" It is a great truth," remarked Iduna, 
'' and leads to a higher one." 



OF ISKANDER. 25? 

** Even so," replied the Eremite. " We 
are full of wisdom in old age, as in winter 
this river is full of water, but the fire of 
youth, like the summer Sun, dries up the 
stream." 

Iduna did not reply. The Eremite 
attracted her attention to a patch of cresses 
on the opposite bank of the stream. 
" Every morn I rise only to discover 
fresh instances of omnipotent benevo- 
lence," he exclaimed. " Yesterday ye 
tasted my honey and my fish. To-day I 
can offer ye a fresh dainty. We will 
break our fast in this pleasant glen. Rest 
ihou here, gentle youth, and I will sum- 
mon thy brother to our meal. I fear me 
much he does not bear so contented a 
spirit as thyself." 

*' He is older, and has seen more," re- 
plied Iduna. 



'25S THE RISE 

The Eremite shook his head, and lean- 
ing on his staff, returned to the cavern. 
Iduna remained, seated on a mossy rock, 
listening to the awakening birds, and 
musing over the fate of Iskander. While 
she was indulging in this reverie, her 
name was called. She looked up with a 
blush, and beheld Nicseus. 

'' How fares my gentle comrade ?" in- 
quired the Prince of Athens. 

" As well as I hope you are, dear Ni- 
caeus. We have been indeed fortunate in 
finding so kind a host." 

" I think I may now congratulate you 
on your safety," said the Prince. " This 
unfrequented pass will lead us in two 
days to Epirus, nor do I indeed now fear 
pursuit." / 

" Acts and not words must express in 
future how much we owe to you,'" said 



OF ISKAXDER. O.59 

Iduna. ''My joy would be complete if 
my father only knew of our safety, and 
if our late companion were here to share 
it." 

" Fear not for my friend," replied 
Niceeus. " I have faith in the fortune of 
liikander." 

" If any one could succeed under such 
circumstances, he doubtless is the man," 
rejoined Iduna; " but it was indeed an 
awful crisis in his fate." 

" Trust me, dear lady, it is wise to 
banish gloomy thoug-hts." 

" We can give him only our thoughts," 
said Iduna, " and when we remember 
how much is dependent on his life, can 
they be cheerful ?" 

" Mine must be so, when I am in the 
presence of Iduna ;" replied Niceeus. 
fc - The daughter of Ilunniades gathered 



2(10 THE RISE 

moss from the rock, and threw it into 
the stream. 

" Dear lady," said the Prince of 
Athens, seating himself by her side, and 
stealing her gentle hand. " Pardon me, 
if an irrepressible feeling at this moment 
impels me to xecur to a subject, which, I 
would fain hope, were not so unpleasing 
to you, as once unhappily you deemed it. 
Oh ! Iduna, Iduna, best and dearest, we 
are once more together ; once more I 
gaze upon that unrivalled form, and listen 
to the music of that matchless voice. I 
sought you, I perhaps violated my pledge, 
but T sought you in captivity and sorrow. 
Pardon me, pity me, Iduna ! Oh ! 
Iduna, if possible, love me!" 

She turned away her head, she turned 
away her streaming eyes. " It is impos- 
sible not to love my deliverer," she re- 



OF ISKANDER. 26l 

plied, in a low and tremnlous voice, 
'* even could he not prefer the many 
other claims to affection -which are pos- 
sessed by the Prince of Athens. I was 
not prepared for this renewal of a most 
painful subject, perhaps under no cir- 
cumstances ; but least of all, under 
those in which we now find our- 
selves." 

** Alas!" exclaimed the Prince; ''I 
can no longer controul my passion. My 
life, not my happiness merely, depends 
upon Iduna becoming mine. Bear with 
me, my beloved, bear with me ! Were 
k you Nicaeus, you too would need forgive- 
ness." 

" I beseech you, cease !" exclaimed 
Iduna, in a firmer voice ; and, withdraw- 
ing her hand, she suddenly rose. " This 
is neither the time nor place for such 



2G2 THE RISE 

conversatiou . I have not forgotten that, 
but a few days back, I was a hopeless cap- 
tive, and that my liie and fame are even 
now in danger. Great mercies have been 
vouchsafed to me ; but still I perhaps 
need the hourly interposition of heavenly 
aid. Other than such worldly thoughts 
should fill my mind, and do. Dear Ni- 
caeus," she continued, in a more soothing 
tone, " you have nobly commenced a 
most heroic enterprize : fulfil it in like 
spirit." 

He would have replied ; but at this 
moment, the staff of the Eremite sounded 
among the rocks. Baffled, and dark with 
rage and passion, the Prince of Athens 
quitted Iduna, and strolled towards the 
upper part of the glen, to conceal his 
anger and disappointment. 

•' Eat, gentle youth," said the Eremite. 



OF ISKANDER. 268 

'* Will not thy brother join us ? What 
may be his name ?" 

" NicaBus, holy father." 

" And thine V* 

Iduna blushed and hesitated. At 
leng-th, in her confusion, she replied 
" Iskandcr." 

" Niccieus!" called out the Emerite, 
" Iskander and myself await thee !" 

Iduna trembled. She was ag-reeably 
surprised when the Prince returned with 
a smihng countenance, and joined in the 
meal, with many cheerful words. 

" Now, I propose," said the Eremite, 
" that youi-self and your brother Iskander 
should tarry with me some days, if, in- 
deed, my simple fare have any tempta- 
tion." 

** I thank thee, holy father," replied 
Nicseus, '' but our affairs are urgent ; nor 



264 THE RISE 

indeed could I have tarried here at all, 
had it not been for my young Iskander 
here, who, as you may easily believe, is 
little accustomed to his late exertions. 
But, indeed, towards sunset, we must 
proceed." 

" Bearing with us," added Iduna, '' a 
most grateful recollection of our host." 

" God be with ye, wherever ye may 
proceed," replied the Eremite. 

•' My trust is indeed in him," rejoined 
Iduna. 



XV. 

And so, two hours before sunset, 
mounting their refreshed horses, Nicaeus 
and Tduna quitted, with many kind 
words, the cavern of the Eremite, and 



OF ISKANDER. ^65 

took their way along the winding bank 
of the river. Throughout the moonlit 
night they travelled, ascending the last 
and highest chain of mountains, and 
reaching the summit by dawn. The 
cheerful light of morning revealed to 
them the happy plains of a Christian 
country. With joyful spirits they de- 
scended into the fertile land, and stopped 
at a beautiful Greek village, embowered 
in orchards and groves of olive-trees. 

The Prince of Athens instantly in- 
quired for the Primate, or chief person- 
age of the village, and was conducted to 
his house ; but its master, he was in- 
formed, was without, supervising the 
commencement of the vintage. Leaving 
Iduna with the family of the Primate, 
Nicoeus went in search of him. The 
vineyard was full of groups, busied in the 

VOL. III. N 



^66 THE RISE 

most elegant and jo}ous of human occu- 
pations, gathering", with infinite bursts of 
merriment, the harvest of the vine. 
Some mounted on ladders, fixed against 
the festooning branches, plucked the rich 
bunches, and threw them below, where 
girls, singing in chorus, caught them in 
panniers, or their extended drapery. In 
the centre of the vineyard, a middle-aged 
man watched with a calm, but vigilant 
eye, the whole proceedings, and occa- 
sionally stimulated the indolent, or 
prompted the inexperienced. 

" Christo !" said the Prince of Athens, 
Avhen he had approached him. The Pri- 
mate turned round, but evidently did 
not immediately recognize the person who 
addressed him. 

" I see," continued the Prince, '' that 
my meditated caution was unnecessary. 



OF ISKANDER. 2(J7 

My strange garb is a sufficient dis- 
guise." 

** The Prince Nicaeus !" exclaimed the 
Primate. '' He is, indeed, disguised, but 
will, I am sure, pardon his faithful ser- 
vant." 

" Not a word, Christo 1" replied the 
Prince. " To be brief. I have crossed the 
mountains from Roumelia, and have only 
within this hour recognized the spot 
whither I have chanced to arrive. I have 
a companion with me. I would not be 
known. You comprehend } Aiikirs of 
state. I take it for granted that there 
are none here who will recognize me, 
after three years' absence, in this 
dress." 

** You may feel secure, my Lord," re- 
plied Christo. *' If you puzzled me, who 
have known you since you were no big-

ger than this bunch of grapes, you will 
quite confound the rest." 

" Tis well. I shall stay here a day or 
two, in order to give them an opportunity 
to prepare for my reception. In the 
mean time, it is necessary to send on a 
courier at once. You must manage all 
this for me, Christo. How are your 
daughters ?" 

" So, so, please your Highness,*' re- 
plied Christo. " A man with seven 
daughters has got trouble for every day in 
the week." 

'' But not when they are as pretty as 
your's are ?" 

*' Poll ! poll ! Handsome is that hand- 
some does ; and as for Alexina, she wants 
to be married." 

'' Very natural. Let her marry, by all 
means." 



I 



OF ISKANDER. 269 

** But Helena wants to do the same." 

" More natural still ; for, if possible, 
she is prettier For my part, I could 
marry them both." 

" Ay, ay ! that is all very well ; but 
handsome is that handsome does. I 
have no objection to Alexina marrying, 
and even Helena; but tlien there is 
Lais ." 

" Hah ! hah ! hah !" exclaimed the 
Prince. ** I see, my dear Christo, that 
my foster sisters give you a very proper 
portion of trouble. However, I must be 
off to my travelling companion. Come 
in as soon as you can, my dear fellow, and 
we will settle every thing. A good vin- 
tage to you, and only as much mischief 
as necessary." So saying, the Prince 
tripped away. 

" Well ! who would have thought of 



270 THE RISE 

seeing him here !" exclaimed the worthy 
Primate. " The same gay dog as ever ! 
What can he have been doing in Rou- 
melia ? Affairs of state, indeed ! I'll 
wager my new Epiphany scarf, that, 
whatever the affairs are, there is a pretty 
girl in the case." 



XVI. 

The fair Iduna, after all her perils and 
sufferings, was at length sheltered in safety 
under a kind and domestic roof. Alexina, 
and Helena, and Lais, and all the other sis- 
ters emulated each other in the attentions 
which they lavished upon the two bro- 
thers, but especially the youngest. Their 
kindness, indeed, was only equalled by 
their ceaseless curiosity, and had they 



OF ISKANDER. ^Jl 

ever waited for the answers of Iduna to 
their questions, the daughter of Ilunni- 
ades might, perhaps, have heeu some- 
what puzzled to reconcile her responses 
with probability. Helena answered the 
questions of Alexina : Lais anticipated 
even Helena. All that Iduna had to do, 
was to smile and be silent, and it was 
universally agreed that Iskander was sin- 
gularly shy as well as excessively hand- 
some. In the meantime, when Niceeus 
met Iduna in the evening of the second 
day of their visit, he informed her that 
he had been so fortunate as to resume an 
acquaintance with an old companion in 
aruLsin the person of a neighbouring noble, 
who had invited them to rest at his castle at 
the end of their next day's journey. He 
told her likewise that he had dispatched 
a courier to Croia to inquire after Iskan- 



272 THE RISE 

der, who, he expected, in the course of a 
very few days, would bring- them intelli- 
gence to guide their future movements, 
and decide whether they should at once 
proceed to the capital of Epirus, or ad- 
vance into Bulgaria, in case Hunniades 
was still in the field. On the morrow, 
therefore, they proceeded on their jour- 
ney. Nicaeus had procured a litter for 
Iduna, for which her delicate health was 
an excuse to Alexina and her sisters, and 
they were attended by a small body of 
well-armed cavalry, for according to the 
accounts which Nicaeus had received, the 
country was still disturbed. They de- 
parted at break of day, Nicaeus riding by 
the side of the litter, and occasionally 
making the most anxious inquiries kfter 
the well-being of his fair charge. An 
hour after noon they rested at a well, 



OF ISKANDER. 273 

surrounded by olive trees, until the ex- 
treme heat was somewhat allayed ; and 
then remounting, proceeded in the direc- 
tion of an undulating' ridge of green hills, 
that partially intersected the wide plain. 
Towards sunset the PrinceW Athens with- 
drew the curtains of the litter, and called 
the attention of Iduna to a veiy fair 
castle, rising on a fertile eminence and 
sparkling in the quivering beams of dying 
light. 

" I fear," said Nicaeus, " that my friend 
Justinian will scarcely have returned, 
but we are old comrades, and he desired 
me to act as his Seneschal. For your 
sake I am sorry, Iduna, for I feel con- 
vinced that he would please you." 

" It is, indeed, a fair castle," replied 
Iduna, ** and none but a true knight de- 
serves such a noble residence." 

N 5 



274 THE RISE 

While she spoke the commander of the 
escort sounded his bugle, and they com- 
menced the ascent of the steep, a wind- 
ing* road, cut through a thick wood of 
evergreen shrubs. The gradual and easy 
ascent soon brought them to a portal 
flanked with towers, which admitted them 
into the outworks of the fortification. 
Here they found several soldiers on guard, 
and the commander again sounding his 
bugle, the gates of the castle opened, and 
the Seneschal, attended by a suite of 
many domestics, advanced and welcomed 
Nicaeus and Iduna. The Prince ot 
Athens dismounting, assisted his fair 
companion from the litter, and leading 
her by the hand, and preceded by the 
Seneschal, entered the castle. 

They passed through a magnificent 
hall, hung with choice armour, and as- 



OF ISKANDER. 275 

cending a staircase, of Pentelic marble, 
were ushered into a suite of lofty cham- 
bers, lined with Oriental tapestry, and 
furnished with many costly couches and 
cabinets. While they admired a spec- 
tacle so different to any thing they had 
recently beheld or experienced, the Se- 
neschal, followed by a number of slaves 
in splendid attire, advanced and offered 
them rare and choice refreshments, coffee 
and confectionary, sherbets and spiced 
wines. When they had partaken of this 
elegant cheer, Nicaeus intimated to the 
Seneschal that the Lady Iduna might 
probably wish to retire, and instantly a 
discreet matron, followed by six most 
beautiful girls, each bearing a fragrant 
torch of cinnamon and roses, advanced 
and offered to conduct the Lady Iduna to 
her apartments. 



276 THE RISE 

The matron and her company of mai- 
dens conducted the daughter of Hunni- 
ades down a long gallery, which led to a 
suite of the prettiest chambers in the 
world. The first was an ante-chamber, 
painted like a bower, but filled with the 
music of living birds ; the second, which 
was much larger, was entirely covered 
with A^enetian mirrors, and resting on a 
bright Persian carpet, were many couches 
of crimson velvet, covered with a variety 
of sumptuous dresses ; the third room was 
a bath, made in the semblance of a gigan- 
tic shell. Its roof was of transparent ala- 
baster, glowing with shadowy light. 



OF ISKANDER. 277 



XVII. 

A flourish of trumpets announced the 
return of the Lady Iduna, and the Prince 
of Athens, magnificently attired, came 
forward with a smile and led her, with a 
compliment on her resuming the dress of 
her sex, if not of her country, to the ban- 
quet. Iduna was not uninfluenced by 
that excitement which is insensibly pro- 
duced by a sudden change of scene and 
circumstances, and especially by an un- 
expected transition from hardship, peril, 
and suffering, to luxury, security, and 
enjoyment. Their spirits were elevated 
and gay : she smiled upon Nicaeus with 
a cheerful sympathy. They feasted, they 



278 THE RISE 

listened to sweet music, they talked over 
their late adventures, and animated by 
their own enjoyment, they became more 
sanguine as to the fate of Iskander. 

*' In two or three days we shall know 
more," said Nicaeus. '' In the mean- 
time, rest is absolutely necessary to you. 
It is only now that you will begin to be 
sensible of the exertion you have made. 
If Iskander be at Croia, he has already 
informed your father of your escape ; if 
he have not arrived, I have arranged that 
a courier shall be dispatched to Hun- 
niades from that city. Do not be anx- 
ious. Try to be happy. I am myself 
sanguine that you will find all well. 
Come, pledge me your father's health, 
fair lady, in this goblet of Tenedos ! " 

" How know I that at this mo- 
ment he may not be at the point of 



OF ISKANDER. 279 

death ?" replied Iduna. " When I am 
absent from those I love, I dream only of 
their unhappiness." 

" At this moment also," rejoined 
Nicaeus, *' he dreams perhaps of your im- 
prisonment among- barbarians. Yet how 
mistaken ! Let that consideration sup- 
port you. Come ! here is to the Ere- 
mite." 

*' As willing-, if not as sumptuous a 
host as our present one," said Iduna; 
" and when, by-the-bye, do you think 
that your friend, the Lord Justinian, will 
arrive." 

" Oh ! never mind him," said Nicaeus. 
" He would have arrived to-morrow, but 
the great news which I gave him has pro- 
bably chan2;"ed his })lans. I told him of 
the approaching invasion, and he has 
perhaps found it necessary to visit the 



280 THE RISE 

neighbouring chieftains, or even to go on 
to Croia." 

" Well-a-day 1" exclaimed Iduna, " I 
would we were in my father's camp!" 

"We shall soon be there, dear lady," 
replied the Prince. " Come, worthy 
Seneschal," he added, turning to that 
functionary, " drink to this noble lady's 
happy meeting with her friends." 



XVIII. 

Three or four days passed away at the 
castle of Justinian, in which Nicteus used 
his utmost exertions to divert the anxiety 
of Iduna. One day was spent in exa- 
mining the castle, on another he amused 
her with a hawking party, on a third he 
carried her to the neighbouring ruins of 



OF ISKANDER. 281 

a temple, and read his favourite iEschylus 
to her amid its lone and elegant columns. 
It was impossible for any one to be more 
amiable and entertaining-, and Iduna 
could not resist from recognizing his 
many virtues and accomplishments. The 
courier had not yet returned from Croia, 
which Niceeus accounted for by many 
satisfactory reasons. The suspence, how- 
ever, at length became so painful to 
Iduna, that she proposed to the Prince 
of Athens that they should, without 
further delay, proceed to that city. As 
usual, Nicaeus was not wanting in many 
plausible arguments in favour of their 
remaining at the castle, but Iduna w^as 
resolute. 

** Indeed, dear Nicaeus," she said, "my 
anxiety to see my father, or hear from 
him, is so great, that there is scarcely any 



282 THE RISE 

danger which 1 would not encounter to 
gratify my wish. I feel that I have 
already taxed your endurance too much. 
But we are no longer in a hostile land, 
and guards and guides are to be eng-aged. 
Let me then depart alone !" 

" Iduna !" exclaimed Nicaeus, re- 
proachfully. ** Alas ! Iduna, you are 
cruel, but I did not expect this !" 

" Dear Nicaeus !" she answered, '* you 
always misinterpret me ! It would infi- 
nitely delight me to be restored to Hun- 
niades by yourself, but these are no com- 
mon times, and you are no common 
person. You forget that there is one 
that has greater claims upon you even 
than a forlorn maiden — your country. 
And whether Iskander be at Croia 6r not, 
Greece requires the presence and exer- 
tions of the Prince of Athens." 



OF ISKANDER. 28S 

'* I have no country," replied Nicaeus, 
mournfully, " and no object for which to 
exert myself." 

" Nicaeus ! Is this the poetic patriot 
who was yesterday envying Themis- 
tocles ?" 

*' Alas ! Iduna, yesterday you were 
my muse. I do not wonder you are 
wearied of this castle," continued the 
Prince in a melancholy tone. '' This 
spot contains nothing* to interest you ; 
but for me, it holds all that is dear, and — 
oh ! gentle maiden, one smile from you, 
one smile of inspiration, and I would not 
envy Themistocles, and might perhaps 
rival him." 

They were walking together in the 
hall of the castle ; Iduna stepped aside 
and affected to examine a curious 
buckler, Nicaeus followed her, and 



284 THE RISE 

placing his arm gently in hers, led her 
away. 

" Dearest Iduna," he said, " pardon 
me, but men struggle for their fate. 
Mine is in your power. It is a contest 
between misery and happiness, glory and 
perhaps infamy. Do not then wonder 
that I will not yield my chance of the 
brighter fortune without an effort. Once 
more I appeal to your pity, if not to 
your love. Were Iduna mine, were she 
to hold out but the possibility of her 
being mine, there is no career — solemnly 
I avow what solemnly I feel — there is no 
career of which I could not be capable, 
and no conditions to which I would not 
willingly subscribe. But this certainty, 
or this contingency, I must have : I can- 
not exist without the alternative. And 
now, upon my knees, I implore her to 
grant it to me !"

** Nicseus/' said Iduna, " this conti- 
nued recurrence to a forbidden subject is 
most ung-enerous." 

" Alas! Iduna, my life depends upon 
a word, which you will not speak, and 
you talk of generosity ! No ! Iduna, 
it is not I that am ungenerous." 

" Let me say then unreasonable, Prince 
ucseus. 

" Say what you like, Iduna, provided 
you say that you are mine." 

" Pardon me. Sir ; I am free." 

" Free ! You have ever underrated me, 
Iduna. To whom do you owe this 
boasted freedom ?" 

*' This is not the first time," remarked 
Iduna, " that you bave reminded me of 
an obligation, the memory of which is 
indelibly impressed upon my heart, and 
lor which even the present conversation 



(528 THE RISE 

cannot make me feel less grateful. I can 
never forget that I owe all that is dear to 
yourself and your companion." 

*' My companion !" replied the Prince 
of Athens, pale and passionate. " My 
companion ! Ami ever to be reminded 
of my companion ?'* 

'* Nicaeus !" said Iduna ; " if you for- 
get what is due to me, at least endea- 
vour to remember what is due to your- 
self !" 

" Beautiful being !" said the Prince ad- 
vancing and passionately seizing her hand ; 
*' pardon me! — pardon me! 1 am not 
master of my reason ; I am nothing, I 
am nothing while Iduna hesitates." 

'' She does not hesitate, Niceeus. I 
desire — I require that this conversation 
shall cease — shall never, never be re- 
newed." 



OF ISKANDER. 287 

"And I tell thee, haughty woman," 
said the Prince of x\thens grinding his 
teeth, and speaking with violent action, 
" that I will no longer be despised with 
impunity. Iduna is mine, or is no one 
else^s." 

" Js it possible ?" exclaimed the daugh- 
ter of Hunniades. " Is it indeed come to 
this } But why am I surprised ! I have 
long known Nicaeus. 1 quit this castle 
instantly." 

'* You are a prisoner," replied the 
Prince very calmly, and leaning with 
folded arms against the wall. 

*' A prisoner!" exclaimed Iduna, a 
little alarmed — "A prisoner 1 I defy 
you. Sir. You are only a guest like my- 
self. I will appeal to the Seneschal 
in the absence of his Lord. He will 
never permit the honour of his master's 



288 THE RISE 

flag to be violated by the irrational ca- 
price of a passionate boy/' 

" What lord ?" inquired Nicaeus. 

" Your friend, the Lord Justinian," 
answered Iduna. " He could little anti- 
cipate such an abuse of his hospitality." 

" My friend, the Lord Justinian !" re- 
plied Nicaeus with a malignant smile. " I 
am surprised that a personage of the Lady 
Iduna's deep discrimination should so 
easily be deceived by ' a passionate boy !* 
Is it possible that you could have sup- 
posed for a moment that there was any 
other Lord of this castle, save your de- 
voted slave ?" 

" What !" exclaimed Iduna, really 
frightened. 

" I have indeed the honour of finding 
the Lady Iduna my guest," continued 
Nicaeus in a tone of bitter raillery. 



OF ISKANDER. 289 

" This castle of Kallista, the fairest in all 
Epirus, I inherit from my mother. Of 
late I have seldom visited it ; but indeed 
it will become a favourite residence of 
mine, if it be, as I anticipate, the scene 
of my nuptial ceremony." 

Iduna looked around her with astonish- 
ment, then threw herself upon a couch, 
and burst into tears. The Prince ot 
Athens walked up and down the hall 
with an air of determined coolness. 

" PerHdious I" exclaimed Iduna be- 
tween her sobs. 

" Lady Iduna," said the Prince, and 
he seated himself by her side. " I wiil 
not attempt to palliate a deception which 
your charms could alone inspire and can 
alone justify. Hear me. Lady Iduna, 
hear me with calmness. I love you ; I 
love you \vith a passion which has been

as constant as it is strong. My birth, my 
rank, my fortunes, do not disqualify me 
lor an union with the daughter of the 
great Hunniades. If my personal claims 
may sink in comparison with her surpass- 
ing excellence, I am yet to learn that 
any other Prince in Christendom can 
urge a more effective plea. 1 am young ; 
the ladies of the court have called me 
handsome ; by your great father's side I 
have broken some lances in your honour; 
and even Idunaonce confessed she thought 
me clever. Come, come, be merciful ! 
Let my beautiful Athens receive a fitting 
mistress ! A holy father is in readiness, 
dear maiden. Come now, one smile ! In 
a few days we shall reach your father's 
camp, and then we will kneel, a^ I do 
now, and beg a blessing on our happy 
union." As he spoke, he dropped upon his 



OF ISKANDER. 291 

knee, and stealing her hand, looked into 
her face. It was sorrowful and gloomy. 

*' It is in vain, Nicaeus," said Idiina, 
" to appeal to your g-enerosity ; it is 
useless to talk of the past; it is idle to 
reproach you for the present. I am a 
woman, alone and pei'secuted, where I 
could least anticipate persecution. Ni- 
caeus, I never can be your's ; and now I 
deliver myself to the mercy of Almighty 
God." 

" Tis well," said Nicaeus. " From 
the tower of the Castle you may behold 
the waves of the Ionian Sea. You will 
remain here a close prisoner, until one of 
my galleys arrive from Piraeus to bear us 
to Italy. Mine you must be, Iduna. It 
remains for you to decide under what 
circumstances. Continue in your obsti- 
nacy, and you may bid farewell for ever

Oi)2 THE RISE 

to your country and to your father. Be 
reasonable, and a destiny awaits you, 
which offers everything that has hitherto 
been considered the source or cause of 
happiness." Thus speaking, the Prince 
retired, leaving the Lady Iduna to her 
own unhappy thoughts. 



XIX. 

The Lady Iduna was at first inclined to 
view- the conduct of the Prince of Athens 
as one of those passionate and passing 
ebullitions in which her long acquaintance 
with him had taught her he was accus- 
tomed to indulge. But when on retiring 
soon after to her apartments, she was 
m formed by her attendant matron that 
she must in future consider herself a pri- 



OF ISKANDER, 293 

soner, and not venture agtiin to quit them 
without permission, she began to tremble 
at the possible violence of an ill-regulated 
mind. She endeavoured to interest her 
attendant in her behalf; but the matron 
was too well schooled to evince any feel- 
ing or express any opinion on the sub- 
ject ; and indeed, at length, fairly in- 
formed Iduna that she was commanded to 
confine her conversation to the duties of 
her office. 

The Lady Iduna was very unhappy 
She thought of her father, she thought of 
Iskander. The past seemed a dream; she 
was often tempted to believe that she was 
still, and had ever been, a prisoner in the 
Serail of Adrianople ; and that all the late 
wonderful incidents of her life were but 
the shifting scenes of some wild slumber. 
And then some slight incident, the sound 



294 THE RISE 

of a hell, or the si^-ht of some holy em- 
blem, assured her she was in a Christian 
land, and convinced her of the strange 
truth that she was indeed in captivity, 
and a prisoner, above all others, to the 
fond companion of her youth. Her in- 
dignation at the conduct of Nicaeus roused 
her courage ; she resolved to make an 
effort to escape. Her rooms w^ere only 
lighted from above; she determined to 
steal forth at night into the gallery ; the 
door was secured . She hastened back to 
her chamber in fear and sorrow, and wept. 
Twice in the course of the day the 
stern and silent matron visited Iduna 
with her food ; and as she retired, secured 
the door. This was the onl}^ individual 
that the imprisoned Lady ever beheld. 
And thus heavily rolled on upwards of 
a week. On the eve of the ninth day. 



OF ISK^VNDER. 295 

Iduna was surprised by the matron pre- 
senting- her a letter as she quitted the 
chamber for the night. Iduna seized it 
with a feeling- of curiosity not unmixed 
with pleasure. It was the only incident 
that had occurred during her captivity. 
She recoo^nized the hand-writinsf of Ni- 
eaeus, and threw it down with vexation 
at her silliness in supposing, for a mo- 
ment, that the matron could have been 
the emissary of any other person. 

Yet the letter must be read, and at 
length she opened it. It informed her 
that a ship had arrived from Athens at 
the coast, and that to-morrow she must 
depart for Italy. It told her also, that 
the Turks, under Mahomed, had in- 
vaded Albania ; and that the Hungarians 
under the command of her father, had 
come to support the Cross. It said no- 



290 THE RISE 

thing of Iskander. But it reminded her 
that little more than the same time that 
would carry her to the coast to embark 
for a foreign land, would, were she wise, 
alike enable Nicaeus to place her in her 
father's arms, and allow him to join in 
the great struggle for his country and his 
creed. The letter was written with firm- 
ness, but tenderly. It left, however, on 
the mind of Iduna an impression of the 
desperate resolution of the writer. 

Now it so happened that as this un- 
happy lady jumped from her couch, and 
paced the room in the perturbation of her 
mind, the wind of her drapery extin- 
guished her lamp. As her attendant, or 
gaoler, had paid her last visit for the day, 
there seemed little chance of its being 
again illumined. The miserable are al- 
ways more unhappy in the dark. Light 



OF ISKANDER. i<><J7 

is the greatest of comforters. And so 
this little misfortune seemed to the for- 
lorn Iduna almost overwhelming. And 
as she attempted to look around, and 
wrung her hands in very woe, her atten- 
tion was attracted by a brilliant streak 
of light upon the wall, which greatly 
surprised her. She groped her w^ay in 
its direction, and slowly stretching forth 
her hand, observed that it made its way 
through a chink in the frame of one of 
the great mirrors whicn were inlaid in 
the wall. And as she pressed the frame, 
she felt to her surprise that it sprang for- 
ward. Had she not been very cautious 
the advancing mirror would have struck 
her with great force, but she had presence 
of mind to withdraw her hand very gra- 
dually, repressing the swiftness of the 
spring. The aperture occasioned by the 

o5 



298 THE RISE 

opening of the mirror consisted of a re- 
ces?5, formed by a closed-up window. An 
old wooden shutter, or blind, in so ruin- 
ous a state, that the light freely made its 
way, w^as the only barrier against the 
elements. Iduna, seizing the handle 
which remained, at once drew it open 
with little difficulty. 

The captive gazed with gladdejied feel- 
ings upon the free and beautiful scene. 
Beneath her rose the rich and aromatic 
shrubs tinged with the soft and silver light 
of eve : before her extended the wide and 
fertile champaign, skirted by the dark 
and undulating mountains : in the clear 
sky, glittering and sharp, sparkled the 
first crescent of the New Moon, an auspi- 
cious omen to the Moslemin invaders. 

Iduna gazed with joy upon the land- 
scape, and then hastily descending from 



OF ISKANDER. 299 

the recess,she placed her hands to her eyes, 
so long;- unaccustomed to the light. Per- 
haps, too, she indulged in momentary 
meditation. For suddenly seizing- a num- 
ber of shawls which were lying on one of 
the couches, she knotted them together, 
and then striving with all her force, she 
placed the heaviest couch on one end of 
the costly cord, and then throwing the 
other out of the window, and entrusting 
herself to the merciful care of the holy 
Virgin, the bi-ave daughter of Hunuiades 
successfully dropped down into the gar- 
den below. 

She stopped to breathe, and to revel in 
her emancipated existence. It was a bold 
enterprise gallantly achieved. But the 
danger had now only commenced. She 
found that she had li^-hted at the back of 
the castle. She stole along upon tip-toe, 



300 THE RISE 

timid as a fawn. She remembered a 
small wicket-gate that led into the open 
country. She arrived at it. It was of 
course guarded. The single sentinel was 
kneeling before an image of St. George, 
beside him was an empty drinking-cup 
and an exhausted wine-skin. 

" Holy Saint !" exclaimed the pious 
sentinel, " preserve us from all Turkish 
infidels !" Iduna stole behind him. 
" Shall men who drink no wine conquer 
true Christians !'* continued the sentinel. 
Iduna placed her hand upon the lock. 
" We thank thee for our good vintage/* 
said the sentinel. Iduna opened the 
gate with the noiseless touch which a 
feminine finger can alone command. 
'• And for the rise of the Lord Iskander !*' 
added the sentinel. Iduna escaped ! 

Now she indeed was free. Swiftly she 



OF ISKANDER. 301 

ran over the wide plain. She hoped to 
reach some town or village before her 
escape could be discovered, and she hur- 
ried on for three hours without restinsf. 
She came to a beautiful grove of olive- 
trees that spread in extensive ramifica- 
tions about the plain. And through this 
beautiful grove of olive-trees her path 
seemed to lead. So she entered and ad- 
vanced. And when she had journeyed 
for about a mile, she came to an open 
and very verdant piece of ground, which 
was, as it were, the heart of the grove. 
In its centre rose a fair and antique struc- 
ture of white marble, shroudinii from the 
noonday Sun the perennial flow of a 
very famous fountain. It was near on 
midnight. Iduna was wearied, and she 
sat down upon the steps of the fountain 
for rest. And while she was musing 



302 THE RISE 

over all the strang-e adventures of her 
life, she heard a rustling in the wood, 
and being alarmed, she rose and hid her- 
self behind a tree. 

And while she stood there, with palpi- 
tating heart, the figure of a man ad- 
vanced to the fountain from an opposite 
direction of the grove. He went up the 
steps, and looked down upon the spring 
as if he were about to drink, but instead 
of doing that, he drew his scimitar and 
plunged it into the water, and called out 
with a loud voice the name of " Iskan- 
der !" three times. Whereupon Iduna, 
actuated by an irresistible impulse, came 
forward from her hiding place, but in- 
stantly gave a loud shriek when she be- 
held — the Prince Mahomed ! 

'*0h ! night of glory !" exclaimed the 
Prince, advancing. " Do I indeed be- 



OF ISKANDER. 303 

hold the fair Iduna ! This is truly 
magic !" 

" Away 1 away !" exclaimed the dis- 
tracted Iduna, as she endeavoured to fly 
from him. 

" He has kept his word, that cunning- 
leech, better than I expected," said Ma- 
homed, seizing her. 

*' As well as you deserve, ravisher !" 
exclaimed a majestic voice. A tall hgure 
rushed forward from the wood and dash- 
ed back the Turk. 

" I am here to complete my contract, 
Prince Mahomed, " said the stranger, 
drawing his sword. 

" Iskander !" exclaimed the Prince. 

*' We have met beibre, Prince. Let 
us so act now that we may meet lor the 
last time." 

*' Infamous, infernal traitor,"' exclaimed 



304 THE RISE 

Mahomed, '' dost thou, indeed, imagine 
that I will sully my imperial blade with 
the blood of my runaway slave ! No ! 
I came here to secure thy punishment, 
but I cannot condescend to become thy 
punisher. Advance, guards, and seize 
him ! Seize them both !" 

Iduna flew to Iskander, who caught 
her in one arm, while he waved his 
scimitar with the other. The guards of 
Mahomed poured forth from the side of 
the grove whence the Prince had issued. 

*' And dost thou, indeed, think, Ma- 
homed," said Iskander, '' that I have 
been educated in the Seraglio to be duped 
by Moslemin craft. I offer thee single 
combat if thou desirest it, but combat as 
we may, the struggle shall be equal." 
He whistled, and instantly a body of 
Hungarians, headed by Hunniades him- 



OF ISKANDER. 305 

self, advanced from the side of the grove 
whence Iskander had issued. 

" Come on, then," said Mahomed ; 
" each to his man." Their swords clashed, 
but the principal attendants of the son of 
Amurath, deeming the affair, under the 
present circumstances, assumed the cha- 
racter of a mere rash adventure, bore 
away the Turkish Prince. 

" To-morrow, then, this fray shall be 
decided on the plains of Kallista," said 
Mahomed . 

" Epirus is prepared," replied Iskan- 
der. 

The Turks withdrew. Iskander bore 
the senseless form of Iduna to her father. 
Hunniades embraced his long lost child. 
They sprinkled her face with water from 
the fountain. She revived. 

" Where is Nicseus," inquired Iskan- 



.'30(i THE RISE 

der ; and how came you again, dear 
lady, in the power of Mahomed ?" 

" Alas ! noble Sir, my twice deliverer," 
answered Iduna, " I have, indeed, again 
been doomed to captivity, but my per- 
secutor, I blush to say, was this time a 
Christian Prince." 

" Holy Virgin !" exclaimed Iskander. 
" V/ho can this villain be ?" 

'• The villain, Lord Iskander, is your 
friend ; and your pupii, dear father." 

" Niceeus, of Athens !" exclaimed Hun- 
niades. 

Iskander was silent and melancholy. 

Thereupon the Lady Iduna recounted 
to her father and Iskander, sitting be- 
tween them on the margin of the fount, 
all that had occurred to her, since herself 
and Nicaeus parted with Iskander ; nor 
did she omit to relate to Hunniades all 



OF ISKANDEIl. SO? 

the devotion of Iskander, respecting- which, 
like a truly brave man, he had himself 
been silent. The great Hunniades scarcely 
knew which rather to do, to lavish his 
aifection on his beloved child, or his gra- 
titude upon Iskander. Thus they went 
on conversing" for some time, Iskander 
placing- his own cloak around Iduna, and 
almost unconsciously winding his arm 
around her unresisting form. 

Just as they were preparing to return 
to the Christian camp, a great noise was 
heard in the grove, and presently, in 
the direction whence Iduna had arrived, 
there came a band of men, bearing 
torches and examining the grove in all 
directions in great agitation. Iskander 
and Hunniades stood upon their guard, 
but soon perceived they were Greeks. 
Their leader, seeing a group near the 



308 THE RISE 

fountain, advanced to make inquiries re- 
specting the object of his search, but 
when he indeed recognized the persons 
who formed the group, the torch fell 
from his grasp, and he turned away his 
head and hid his face in his hands. 

Iduna clung to her father ; Iskander 
stood with his eyes fixed upon the ground, 
but Hunniades, stern and terrible, dis- 
embarrassing himself of the grasp of his 
daughter, advanced and laid his hand 
upon the stranger. 

" Young man," said the noble father, 
" w^ere it contrition instead of shame that 
inspired this attitude, it might be better. 
I have often warned you of the fatal con- 
sequences of a reckless indulgence of the 
passions. More than once I have pre- 
dicted to you, that however great might 
be your confidence in your ingenuity 



OF ISKANDER. SC9 

and your resources, the hour would ar- 
rive when such a career would place you 
in a position as despicable as it was 
shameful. That hour has arrived, and 
that position is now filled by the Prince 
of Athens. You stand before the three 
individuals in this world whom you have 
most injured, and whom you were most 
bound to love and to protect. Here is a 
friend, who has hazarded his prosperity 
and his existence for your life and your 
happiness. And you have made him a 
mere pander to your lusts, and then de- 
serted him in his greatest necessities. 
This maiden was the companion of your 
youth, and entitled to your kindest 
offices. You have treated her infinitely 
worse than her Turkish captor. And for 
myself, Sir, your father was my dearest 
Iriend. I endeavoured to repay his 



310 THE RISE 

friendship by supplying his place to his 
orphan child. How I discharged my 
duty, it becomes not me to say : how 
you have discharged your's, this lady 
here, my daughter, your late prisoner, 
Sir, can best prove." 

" Oh ! spare me, spare me, Sir," said 
the Prince of Athens, turning and faUing 
upon his knee. " I am most wretched. 
Every word cuts to my very core. Just 
Providence has baffled all my arts, and I 
am gratefuL Whether this lady can, 
indeed, forgive me, I hardly dare to 
think, or even hope. And yet forgive- 
ness is a heavenly boon. Perhaps the 
memory of old days may melt her. As 

for yourself. Sir but TU not speak, I 

cannot. Noble Iskander, if I mistake 
not, you may whisper words in that fair 
ear, less grating than my own. May

you be happy ! I will not profane your 
prospects with my vows. iVnd yet I'll 
say farewell !" 

The Prince of Atliens turned away 
with an air of complete wretchedness, 
and slowly withdrew, Iskander followed 
him. 

" Nicseus," said Iskander ; hut the 
Prince entered the grove, and did not 
turn round. 

** Dear Nicaeus," said Iskander. The 
Prince hesitated. 

" Let us not part thus," said Iskander. 
*' Iduna is most unhappy. She bade me 
tell you she had forgotten all.'* 

** God bless her, and God bless you 
too!" replied Niceeus. " I pray you let 
me go." 

" Nay ! dear Niceeus, are we not 
friends ?" 



312 THE RISE 

'* The best and truest, Iskander. I 
will to the camp, and meet you in your 
tent ere morning break. At present, [ 
would be alone." 

" Dear Nicseus, one word. You have 
said upon one point, what I could well 
wish unsaid, and dared to prophesy 
what may never happen. I am not 
made for such supreme felicity. Epirus 
is my mistress, my Nicaeus. As there is 
a living God, my friend, most solemnly I 
vow, I have had no thoughts in this 
atfair, but for your honour." 

'* I know it, my dear friend, I know 
it," replied Nicaeus. '* I keenly feel 
your admirable worth. Say no more, 
say no more ! She is a fit wife for a hero, 
and you are one!"

XX. 

After the battle of the bridge, Iskan- 
der had hurried to Croia without delay. 
In his progress, he had made many fruit- 
less inquiries after Iduna and Nicaeus, 
but he consoled himself for the unsatis- 
factory answers he received by the opi- 
nion that they had taken a different 
course, and the conviction that all must 
now be safe. The messenger from Croia 
that informed Hunniades of the escape of 
his daughter also solicited his aid in 
favour of Epirus against the impending 
invasion of the Turks, and stimulated by 
personal gratitude as well as by public 
duty, Hunniades answered the solicita- 

VOL. III. p 



.314 THE RISE 

tion in person at the head of twenty 
thousand lances. 

Hunniades and Iskander had mutually 
flattered themselves when apart, that each 
would be able to quell the anxiety of the 
other on the subject of Iduna. The 
leader of Epirus flattered himself that 
his late companions had proceeded at 
once to Transylvania, and the Vaivode 
himself had indulged in the delightful 
hope that the first person he should 
embrace at Croia would be his long-lost 
child. When, therefore, they met, and 
were mutually incapable of imparting 
any information on the subject to each 
other, they were filled with astonishment 
and disquietude. Events, however, gave 
them little opportunity to indulge in^anx- 
iety or grief. On the day that Hun- 
niades and his lances arrived at Croia, 



OF ISKANDER. 315 

the invading' army of the Turks under 
the Price Mahomed crossed the moun- 
tains, and soon after pitched their camp 
on the fertile plain of Kallista. 

As Iskander, by the aid of Hunniades 
and the neighbouring princes, and the 
patriotic exertions of his countrymen, was 
at this moment at the head of a force 
which the Turkish Prince could not liave 
anticipated, he resolv^ed to march at 
once to meet the Ottomans, and decide 
the fate of Greece by a pitched battle. 

The night before the arrival of Iduna 
at the famous fountain, the Christian 
army had taken up its position within 
a few miles of the Turks. The turbaned 
warriors wished to delay the engagement 
until the new moon, the eve of which 
was at hand. And it happened on that 
said eve that Iskander calling to mind his 

v2 



316 THE RISE 

contract with the Turkish Prince made 
in the gardens of the seraglio at Adri- 
anople, and believing from the super- 
stitious character of Mahomed that he 
would not fail to be at the appointed 
spot, resolved, as we have seen, to repair 
to the fountain of Kallista. 

And now from that fountain the hero 
retired, bearing with him a prize scarcely 
less precious than the freedom of his 
country, for which he was to combat on 
the morrow's morn. 

Ere the dawn had broken, the Chris- 
tian power was in motion. Iskander 
commanded the centre, Hunniades the 
right wing. The left was entrusted at his 
urgent request to the Prince of Athens. 
A mist that hung about the plain allowed 
Nicaeus to charge the right wing of the 
Turks almost unperceived. He charged 



OF ISKANDER. JI7 

with irresistible fury, and soon disor- 
dered the ranks of the Moslemin. Ma- 
homed with the reserve hastened to their 
aid. A mighty multitude of Janis- 
saries, shouting- the name of Allah and 
his Prophet, penetrated the Christian 
centre. Hunniades endeavoured to at- 
tack them on their flank, but was him- 
self charged by the Turkish cavalry. The 
battle was now general, and raged with 
terrible fury. Iskander had secreted in 
his centre, a new and powerful battery 
of cannon, presented to him by the Pope, 
and which had just arrived from Venice. 
Tliis battery played upon the Janissaries 
with great destruction . He himself mowed 
them down with his irresistible scimitar. 
Infinite was the slaughter ! awful the up- 
roar ! But of all the Christian knights, 
this day, no one performed such mighty

feats of arms as the Prince of Athens. 
With a reckless desperation, he clashed 
about the field, and every thing seemed 
to yield to his inspired impulse. His ex- 
ample animated his men with such a de- 
gree of enthusiasm, that the division to 
which he was opposed, although encou- 
raged by the presence of Mahomed him- 
self, could no longer withstand the des- 
perate courage of the Christians, and they 
fled in all directions. Then, rushing to the 
aid of Iskander, Nicseus, at the head of a 
body of picked men, dashed upon the 
rear of the Janissaries, and nearly sur- 
rounded them. Hunniades instantly 
made a fresh charge upon the left wing 
of the Turks. A panic fell upon the 
Moslemin, who were little prepared for 
such a demonstration of strength on the 
part of their adversaries. In a few

minutes, their order seemed g-enerally 
broken, and their leadei's in vain endea- 
voured to rally them. Waving his bloody 
scimitar, and bounding on his black 
charger, Iskander called upon his men 
to secure the triumph of the Cross and 
the freedom of Epirus. Pursuit was now 
general.

The Turks were massacred by thou- 
sands. Mahomed, when he found that 
all was lost, fled to the mountains, with a 
train of guards and eunuchs, and left the 
care of his dispersed host to his Pachas. 
The hills were covered with the fugitives 
and their pursuers. Some fled also to 
the sea-shore, where the Turkish fleet was

at anchor. The plain was strewn with 
corpses and arms, and tents and stand- 
ards. The Sun was now high in the 
heavens. The mist had cleared a\\ay ; 
but occasional clouds of smoke still sailed 
about. 

A solitary Christian knight entered a 
winding pass in the green hills, apart 
from the scene of strife. The slow and 
trembling step of his wearied steed would 
have ill qualified him to join in the tri- 
umphant pursuit, even had he himself 
been physically enabled ; but the Chris- 
tian knight was covered with gore, un- 
happily not alone that of his enemies. 
He was, indeed, streaming with desperate 
wounds, and scarcely could his fainting 
form retain its tottering seat. 

The winding pass, which, for some sin- 
gular reason, he now pursued in solitude,

instead of returning to the busy camp for 
aid and assistance, conducted the Knight 
to a small g^reen valley, covered with 
sweet herbs, and entirely surrounded by 
hanging woods. In the centre, rose the 
ruins of a Doric fane : three or four co- 
lumns, grey and majestic. All was still 
and silent, save that in the clear blue sky 
an eagle flew, high in the air, but whirl- 
ing round the temple. 

The Knight reached the ruins of the 
Doric fane, and with difficulty dismount- 
ing from his charger, fell upon the soft 
and flowery turf, and for some moments 
was motionless. His horse stole a few 
yards away, and though scarcely less in- 
jured than its rider, instantly com- 
menced cropping the inviting pasture. 

At length the Christian Knight slowly 
raised his head, and leaning on his arm, 
sighed deeply. His face was very pale ;

but as he looked up, and perceived the 
eagle in the heaven, a smile played upon 
his pallid cheek, and his beautiful eye 
gleamed with a sudden flash of light. 

" Glorious bird !" murmured the Chris- 
tian warrior, '' once I deemed that my 
career might resemble thine ! Tis over 
now ; and Greece, for which I would have 
done so much, will soon forget my im- 
memorial name. I have stolen here to 
die in silence and in beauty. This blue 
air, and these green woods, and these 
lone columns, which oft to me have been a 
consolation, breathing of the poetic past, 
and of the days wherein I fain had lived, 
[ have escaped from the fell field of car- 
nage to die among them. Farewell ! my 
country ! Farewell to one more beauti- 
ful than Greece — farewell, Iduna !" 

These were the last words of Nicaeus, 
Prince of Athens !

While the unhappy lover of the daugh- 
ter of Hunuiades breathed his last words 
to the solitary elements, his more fortu- 
nate friend received, in the centre of his 
scene of triumph, the glorious congratu- 
lations of his emancipated country. The 
discomfiture of the Turks was complete, 
and this overthrow, coupled with their 
recent defeat in Bulgaria, secured Chris- 
tendom from their assaults during the 
remainder of the reii'n of xVmurath the 
Second. Surrounded by his princely 
allies, and the chieftains of Epirus, the 
victorious standards of Christendom, and 
the triumphant trophies of the Moslemin, 
Iskander received from the great Hun- 
niades the hand of his beautiful daugh- 
ter. " Thanks to these brave warriors,"

said the hero, " I can now offer to your 
daughter a safe, an honourable, and a 
Christian home." 

" It is to thee, great Sir, that Epirus 
owes its security," said an ancient chief- 
tain, addressing Iskander, " its national 
existence, and its holy religion. All that 
we have to do now is to preserve them ; 
nor indeed do I see that we can more 
effectually obtain these great objects than 
by entreating thee to mount the redeemed 
throne of thy ancestors. Therefore I say 
God save Iskander, King of Epi- 
rus !" 

And all the people shouted and said, 
" God save the King ! God save 
Iskander, King of Epirus !" 

the end.
