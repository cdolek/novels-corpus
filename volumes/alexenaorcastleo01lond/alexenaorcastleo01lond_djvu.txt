over the magnificent mansion of Lord

sity of an additional great coat as the 
thunder was distinctly heard, and the 
dark shades of night were fast falling 
on the outline of the extensive land- 
scape that lay between his castle and 
that of his friend Sir Edmond Hastings, 
with whom he was then going to dine. 

It was a cold December's evening, in 
the year 1557; the wind howled hor- 
ribly in the neighbouring woods, and 
scarce had his lordship proceeded one 
mile, ere the dcemon of the storm appears 
to have bestrode the blast. The rain 
fell in hissing torrents, intermixed with 
showers of hail, which involved Lord 
Mortimer and his attendant in almost 
total darkness, save when the pale 
and arrowy lightning partially revealed 
the scene, as it gleamed in repeated 
flashes, and momentanly illumined the 
road. The elements groaned ; peal 
succeeded peal, in long and lengthened 
voUies, and all nature appeared threat- 
ened with universal chaos. 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 3 

Lord Mortimer pressed bis steed for- 
ward at a full gallop, and was closely 
attended by his servant, of whom he 
was particularly fond ; his attachment, 
zeal, honesty, and blunt good nature, 
were deeply traced on his lordship's 
memory, and often procured him those 
indulo:encies and familiarities which few 
servants would be allowed. But Tom 
Rourke was an exception to the gene- 
rality of domestics, for he never presum- 
ed on the kindness of his lord, nor ever 
forgot the respect due from a servant to 
his master; indeed, had Lord Mortimer 
been his dearest relative, it is a ques- 
tion, whether Rourke could have been 
more attached ; he would fight for him 
'till the last gasp, if necessary, and 
watched o'er his health and safety with 
the anxiety of a parent. Rourke was 
an Irishman, and about this period, 
thirty years old ; ten of which had 
glided away in tlie service of Lord 
Mortimer, to the mutual satisfaction of 
both ; he was brave as a lion, with a 
heart replete with every generous feel-

distinguished by the appellation of 
' Honest Tom Rourke.' — Butto return : 

His lordship continued at full speed 
(as the road was perfecdj^ safe,) with 
Tom at his heels, who now and then 
burst into such exclamations^ as ' Och 
murder, poor Skylark, there won't be 
a drop in you when we get to Hol- 
lywood-Castle! — Where are you Lion? 
(this last was a favourite Newfoundland 
dog that never failed to accompany him, 
and of both Skylark and Lion, Tom 
was particularly fond,) and therefore 
announced his joy on seeing the lights 
in the windows of the castle, by ex- 
claiming, ' Mushen, yonder's the liglit, 
and it is'nt I that's glad to see it once 
more, to be sure ! — Nell, my jewel, I 
hav'nt seen your ears since the storm 
began before, and there's not much 
fear of it being over inahuri'y!' — 'I 
thought Tom,' said his lordship, (as he 
slackened his pace) ' that a cold windy 
night gave you little inconvenience!* 



CASTLE OF SANTA MAncO. B 

* Very little indeed, my Lord/ said Tom 
respectfully, 'but I am vexed about 
the cattle ; for as to Lion, he does not 
value it ; but Skylark won't be the 
better on't this mouth of Sundays, and 
his coat, which was so sleek to day, will 
stand an end like the burnt heather 
on the bog- of Allen.' His lordship 
laughed, and said, ' so, so, I find all 
' your uneasiness is about the horses I' 
' Not iiil my lord ; I heartily wish you 

* may not be the v*^orse, for by this 
'time you must be drenched to th©^ 
'skin; but please excuse me for first 

' expressing my compassion for these 

* poor du;nb brutes, that can't tell their 
' wants, and Skylark is a favourite, bein»j 
' so gentle that he follows me like a dog, 
' there is not such a beauty in th« 
' whole country, except one, and that 
' is that Spanish lady's horse, and 
' since 1 saw him, I am glad he is her 
'property/ 'Why?' inquired his 
lordship. ' Because she is not only 
'the most beautiful lady I have ever 
'seen, but the best also; all Sir Ed- 



G ALEXENA ; OR THE 

' mond's servants doat on her, and would 
' almost lay down their lives for her 
' sake; there's Betsy, that has lived with 
' my Lady Hastings these ten years, 
' and who is one of the properest young; 
' personages as a waiting-maid, in this 
^ here country, loves her almost as well as 
' her own mistress ; 'troth, I am sartiri 
' she would make an excellent wife for 
' the best lord in the land, and none 
' but the best desarve her.* ' In faith 
Tom,* said his lordship, ' you have 

* excited my curiosity a little ; pray 

* when did she arrive at Hollywood?* 

* About three weeks ; she is the greatest 
' toast within fifty miles. Your lord- 
' ship's tenants have been after putting 

* up prayers that you might see, fall in 
' iove with, and marry her, and her 
! aunt, who is with her, is a very 
' good lady, turned of forty, or there- 
' abouts ; but how could she be bad, 
' seeing she is Sir Edmond's own sister ! 
' As to the lady Alexena,' continued 
Tom, ' there may be an objection, 
' because she is a Spaniard ; but what

'o' that, when her own mother was an 
' English-woman.' ' I know now, who 
the Lady is/ said his lordship, ' and I 
believe you have heard nothing more 
than facts respecting her goodness, 
but hush! we are under the castle 
walls; see the horses to the stable, and 
then bring my dressing-case to my 
chamber.' That I will, my lord, in a 
hurry, was the reply, and the same 
moment they were challenged by the 
sentinel of the watch, and instantly the 
draw-bridge was lowered, and they en- 
tered the court-yard. Sir Edmond met 
Lord Mortimer in the hall, and ex- 
pressed much concern on seeing him 
in such a miserable plight, (as his 
clothes were drenched through with 
rain,) and he felt uneasy lest his 
friend should be a sufferer from the 
inclemency of the night; he therefore 
hurried him to his apartment, where 
he quickly changed his dreeping 
garments, and in a very short time 
made his onntre into the saloon, where 
he found, among a gay and numerous 



8 alexena; or th« 

assemblage, the object of Romke's 
honest praise. The moment was por- 
teritious to both the lady and his lord- 
ship ; he had, from report,, been prepared 
to admire a young female, lovely and 
accomplished ; but his most lively 
imagination, in all its playfulness, had 
not formed an object so every way 
fascinating; no wonder then, that the 
moment he was introduced to Alexena 
de Guzman, he became the willing cap- 
tive of her charms; and when the name 
of Mortimer Mas announced, the face 
and beauteous neck of the fair Spaniard 
became suffused with glowing crimson, 
though she herself could not tell where- 
fore. The noble Mortimer observed 
her emotion, and augured favourably 
from the incident, as it seemed to say, 
his name was not entirely unknown to 
her ; nor was he mistaken, for the name 
of Mortimer had long been familiar, as 
her aunt never felt more agreeably en- 
gaged than when lavishing praises on 
him in her presence, he being a great 



\

favourite with her, they having been for 
years intimately acquainted. 

Before dinner was announced, he had 
the pleasure of enjoying an animated 
conversation with Alexena; and before 
they retired from the saloon, lie became 
the most enamoured of lovers. Among 
the iiMiests of Sir Edmond, were Miss 
Dash fort, his wife's sister, the Rev. 
IVilliam Jones, Henri Bolerno, a Spa- 
niard, cousiii of Alexena,. and many 
other noble personages; but as their 
names are immaterial, I shall pass them 
over in silence. Dinner over, and grace 
« said. Sir Edmond observed what a 
contrast there was in the scene within 
and without the castle; inside, all har- 
mony ; without, the rude hoarse roaring 
of the tempest, and the distant dashing 
of the wares against the rocky beach. 

Hollywood-Castle was situated on the 
western coast of England, and was not 
merely considered a noble ediGce, but 

A 5 



10 ALEXENA ; OR THE 

a place of considerable strength ; it 
commanded a fine view of the country 
oa one side, while on the other, the 
foaming ocean spread in boundless 
extent, and washed a dangerous ledge 
of rocks to the right of the castle, on 
which the luckless mariner often pe- 
rished, though every precaution had 
been taken by Sir Edmond to prevent 
the frequent occurrence of such melan- 
choly catastrophes; lights were placed 
in one of the highest towers that com- 
manded the coast, and boats were 
always in readiness to assist the dis- 
tressed, many of whom had been saved 
by these most praiseworthy exertions. 

Very shortly after the ladies had re- 
tired, the storm increased to a dreadful 
pitch of fury, and shook the castle to 
its base. Consequently considerable 
alarm was excited, and the gentlemen 
arose to seek the ladies for the purpose 
of quieting their fears, when the report 
of a gun, (a signal of distress,) was 
faintly heard ; another and another ra- 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 11 

pidly succeeded, and in a moment after, 
every inmate of the castle was in mo- 
tion. SirEdmond and Lord Mortimer 
rushed out on the ramparts, followed by 
a numerous train. The faint cries of 
the drownins: unfortunates came on the 
blast, and were easily distinguished ; in 
a moment the draw-bridge was lowered, 
and the dark ramparts became reflected 
by the blaze of torches that were 
speedily lighted, and which neither 
wind nor rain could extinguish. Every 
one pressed forward to the rocky shore, 
which lay not more than an hundred 
paces from the castle, and among the 
foremost was Rourke, attended by Lion, 
whom he called his life preserver. 
The flash of the cannon, at intervals, 
illumined the sinking vessel, which 
threatened to go to pieces with each 
succeeding wave, and the wretched 
crew were seen frantically clinging to 
the shattered masts. In a short time 
the shore was crowded with Sir Ed- 
mond's domestics and the neighbouring 
peasants ; but the storm was so exces- 



12 ALEXEWA ; OR THE 

sively violent;, and the rocks so steep 
and dangerous, that the most hardy re- 
fused to venture in a boat to their relief, 
thouij-'h the rewards offered by Sir Ed- 
mond and Lord Mortimer, were very 
liberal ; the attempt, however, it was 
coneeived, would be attended by inevi- 
table destruction. The crew were sen- 
sible that no assistance could reach 
t!iem, and their cries, at this moment, 
became insupportable ; tliey could dis- 
tinguish the land, which few of them 
were ever to reach with life, and fruit- 
lessly stretched forth their hands en- 
treatiuii' that relief which it was a moral 
impossibility to afford. The scene was 
horrible, but in a few moments, sus- 
pense was at an end ; a tremendous 
breaker dashed the frail and crazy vessel 
to pieces, and another hushed the cries 
of the crew in (helongsilenceof a watery 
grave. It was some moments before 
Lord Mortimer was convinced that 
the ship had perished, as she had often 
been undiscernable from the immense 
heavy sea ; but very shortly aftefj a few 



CASTLE OF SANTA MATICO. 13 

of the survivors were seen {loatino* 
towards the shore on pieces of plank, 
to which they had bound themselves ; 
and one particularly could be dislin- 
guislied, bntTettinu" the waves that fre- 
-q neatly raised him many, many feet 
above the surface of the surge, and 
then seemed to sink with him into the 
recesses of the deep. With much diffi- 
culty he was pointed out to Lion, who 
instantly, on perceiving him, plunged 
into the foaniino' tide. The utmost 
anxiety was now excited ; every one 
offered up their prayers for the success 
of the dog, and for the preservation of 
the unfortunate object who then ap- 
peared almost exhausted. Lion was 
repeatedly, within an arm's length of 
him, when some surly and envious wave 
drove him back. Those on the beach 
encouraged him with their cries, and 
at length he was seen to dive or sink. 
One moment all was horror and despair, 
but the following instant the noble ani- 
mal rose within grasp of the almost 
lifeless wretchj and seized him. A shout 



14 ALEXENA ; OR THE 

proclaimed his success, and for a short 
space, the late mournful event was for- 
gotten, in the joyful prospect that one 
life would be saved. Lion rapidly ap- 
proached the shore with playful tail and 
head erect ; but the peril was not yet 
over ; he had the frightful rocks to en- 
counter, as he was too far from the usual 
landing place, and to reach it in his 
present state was impossible. Rourke, 
therefore made the servants fasten a 
rope round his waist^, and at the immi- 
nent dano:er of forfeiting- his existence, 
ventured to the surface of the frio'htful 
surge, and scarce had the white foam 
dashed over his limbs, when he seized 
the sailor with one hand, and the neck of 
Lion wiih the other, and in a moment 
they were hoisted on the beach. The 
senses of the st«'anger had fled, and 
while some were busily employed in ap- 
plying restoratives, others were en- 
deavouring to assist another wretched* 
b eing, who had reached the shore on a 
plank, and was then hanging on a ledge 
of a rockj in momentary expectation of 



CASTLE OP SANTA MARCO. 15 

being buried in the bosom of tlie in- 
furiated deep. By the assistance of 
ropes, he also was saved, but every 
other soul, save these two, perished. 

Sir Edmond commanded his domes- 
tics to hasten towards the castle with 
all possible despatch, that speedy relief 
miii'ht be administered to the unfortu- 
nate strangers, who were carried in 
chairs, and in a few moments after 
they arrived, were undressed and put 
to bed. 

The man whom Lion saved, was long 
insensible, from the fatigue and loss of 
blood that had flowed from a deep 
wound in his side, inflicted by a splinter 
of the wreck, against which he had 
been dashed at the moment the vessel 
went to pieces. In less than half an 
hour, however, he became sensible of 
the danger he had so miraculously 
escaped, and the first words he uttered, 
after offering a fervent prayer to heaven^ 
were, ' Had father Montane been 



IQ ALEXENA ; on THE 

saved:' on being informed (liaf one 
other person in a monk's habit had been 
rescued from the deep, his looks ex- 
pressed his disappointment, and he 
replied, 'that is he,' and then appeared 
buried in thought. Surgical aid had 
almost instantly been procured, and 
on the wound being examined, it was 
pronounced dangerous: quiet was re- 
commended, and strict orders oiven 
that none should disturb the stranjrer 
by asking questions. 

Sir Edmond at this time was as- 
sisting the monk, who begged to be 
left to the solitude of his chamber for 
that evening, and that he should in the 
morning explain from whence he came, 
and the nature of his business. Sir 
Edmond, in reply, observed, he was 
entirely at liberty to act as he thought 
prudent in that respect, and retired, 
wishing him sound and peaceful slumber 
after his fatigue. The monk bad ad- 
dressed Sir Edmond in Spanish, and from 
thence he concluded his guest was of that 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 17 

nation, and though his curiosity was 
somewhat excited ; he resolved not to 
make any attempt to gratify it for the 
present. — 1 should have observed^ that 
while Sir Edmond remained in the 
room, the father had drawn from his 
bosom a sealed packet, which he care- 
fully dried by the fire, and placed under 
his pillow, before he retired to repose. 

When the confusion and bustle 
that the late event had occasioned, 
.•somewhat abated, the gentlemen at- 
tended the ladies in the drawing-room, 
where the strangers became the- topic 
of conversation for the remainder of the 
evening, and many were the praises 
bestowed on Rourke, for the very 
timely assistance he had afforded, and 
both Sir Edmond and his master deter- 
mined to reward him; nor was Lion 
forgotten ; not a creature in the castle 
who were not eager to bestow some 
mark of favour on him. and, indeed, he 
was literally loaded v/ith caresses. 



18 ALEXEJTA ; on THE 

The monk intimated that he had 
arrived from Spain ; and this intimation 
gave birth to many vague conjectures 
in the minds of Sir Edmond and Lord 
Mortimer, who resolved to have a care- 
ful eye on him, as the country was 
much distur})ed by the cruel edicts of 
the detestable Mary, and they suspected 
he was a big-ot from the court of Spain, 
sent for the purpose of adding fuel to 
the flame, that at that period raged 
horribly in every quarter of the king- 
dom. But their suspicions were with- 
out foundation. 

As soon as Tom Rourke had changed 
his garments, he went to see the man, 
whose life, with the assistance of Pro- 
vidence, he had been the means of 
preserving ; and finding him in a deep 
sjumber, sat by his bed, determined to 
watch by him through the night, to mi- 
nister to his wants, should it be neces- 
sary. His sleep, which at first appeared 
tranquil, soon proved otherwise, by his 
sudden jjtartings, and more than once he 



CASTLE OF SANTA MAllCO. 19 

named Montano^ and groaned audibly. 
Tom had learned that this was the name 
of the monk, and resolved to mark the 
expressions of his sleeping patient, 
who shortly after pronounced the name 
of De Guzman, with a deep sigh, and 
muttered a few words in a language to 
which Tom was an entire stranger. 
About two o'clock in the morning he 
av/oke, and on observing Rourke, spoke 
to him in Spanish, but the latter made 
signs he did not comprehend his mean- 
ing. The stranger then lay quiet for 
several minutes, as if trying to recollect 
the late events, and in an instant after, 
started upright in his bed and addressed 
Tom in very good English, at which 
the latter was much surprized. The 
Spaniard inquired by what means, and 
by whose assistance, he had been pre- 
served, and Tom gave him the detail 
of all he knew, mentioning his own 
name with much modesty, and praising 
his master to the skies, who, he said, 
held the rope by which he had been 
lowered, and assisted in drawing them 



so ALEXEXA; OR THE 

up the rocks. Oa Gonzales hearing 
the rank of Lord Mortimer^ he said, 
he felt most grateful, and hoped it 
should be one day in his power to 
render him some acceptable service in 
return, and then again inquired for the 
monk. ' He is now asleep/ Tom replied, 
' but, if necessary, I shall have him 
summoned to your bed side.' ' No ! oh, 
no! by no means, I am merely sorry 
his sleep is not eternal.' Rourke 
started, and imai^ined he was deran^^ed, 
but Gonzales look no notice, and ob- 
served, ' if his streui^ftli would i)nt per- 
mit, he could tell deeds of the monk 
that would make his blood freeze.' ' It 
maybe! it may be!* muttered Tom, 
'all is not ii^old \\y\\ olitters, but don't 
weary yourselt" nsore at present, some , 
otlier time will do as well.' ' Pray,' 
said Gonzales, ' how long hast thou 
lived v\ith thy lord ?' * About ten years 1' 
* Where does he reside?' ' Within five 
miles of tliis castle!' 'And to whom 
does it belong?' ' To Sir Edmond 
Hastings!' 'To Sir Edmond Hastujgs!

say you?' crird Gonzales, with great 
emotion, • Yes/ replied Tom The sick 
man gasped for breath, but in a mo- 
ment he continued, ' Have you ever 
by any chance heard of a Spanish hidy 
«f the name of Alexena de Gnznian?* 
' That I have ; she now rests under this 
roof, and may God's holy angels watch 
her slumbers/ ' Amen, Amen !' was fer- 
vently ejaculated by Gonzales. Tom's 
curiosity was now excited to a painful 
degree, and with very little intreaty he 
gave the stranger all the information in 
his power, and concluded with a hearty 
wish, that she might one day be the wife 
of his lord. ' Is he acquainted with 
her?' again, eagerly demanded Gonza- 
les. ' He has only seen her this evening,' 
replied Tom, ' for the first time ; but as 
my master is the most handsome man, 
and one of the best in England, a great 
deal may be done in a very short time, 
and her aunt doats on my lord ; aye, that 
she does.' ' Well, thank God,' mur- 
mured the invalid, ' all yet may be 
Tyell; it is now four o'clock, do you

therefore^ my good friend, retire to rest, 
as I again feel inclined to sleep, if 
this wound of mine. will permit.' Tom 
was anxious to w atch the remainder of 
the night, but Gonzales insisted on his 
seeking repose. However, the moment 
he left the chamber, he sent one of the 
domestics to take his place, and on 
his seeking his bed, found Lion lying 
along side of it, as if anxiously expect* 
ing his arrival.

xliARLY on the following morning, 
Rourke was summoned to his lord's 
chamber, where he found him already 
half dressed. 'What is the matter?* 
said his lordship, as he entered, '^your 
eyes seem to say you have not slept^ 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 23 

are you indisposed?' ' I never was bet- 
ter in all my life, I humbly thank your 
lordship, but I hope I have not kept 
you waiting, for I know I am but a 
bad valet, and will ill supply Mr. 
Albert's place, howeyer, he was much 
better yesterday, and will soon be able 
to resume his station, and long may he 
enjoy it, for he is as honest a soul as 
ever broke the world's bread.' ' 1 feel 
rejoiced he is so much better,' observed 
his loixlship, * but you really look un- 
well; have you been to bed?' ' That I 
have, though not very long. I thought 
as how I would sit awhile with that 
poor wou[idcd stranger, and on my 
entering his room I found him asleep, 
so I sat on the foot of his bed, and 
while I remained, he chattered in 
his dreams like a magpie, and cursed 
that monkish old Don that we picked 
off the rocks, and, as well as a body 
may guess, not without reason.' ' Let 
me hear what he said.' ' That I will, 
my lord, though the whole is'nt much.' 
Tom then related every word (hat had 



24 ALEXENA* OR THii 

been uttered in the chamber of Gon- 
zales. Lord Mortimer listened atten- 
tively, but merely observed that the un- 
fortunate man's intellect was disturbed 
by his recent danger, and the pain of 
his wound. ' It may be so/ replied Tom, 
'and it is not unlikely but he has got 
more than one/ 'Where?' said his 
lordship. ' One in the body, and the 
other in the mind, and the last seems to 
fijive the greatest pain of the two/ 
Lord Mortimer appeared thoughtfub 
but changed the subject by inquiring 
for Sir Edmond, and shortly after 
descended to the breakfast parlour, 
where he was agreeably surprised to 
find him at such an early hour, and 
they immediately went out on the ram- 
parts together. There his lordship re- 
peated the conversation that had passed 
between the wounded stranger and his 
servant, and requested to know what 
Sir Edmond thought of it. ' I know 
' not what to think ; but our stranger 
' guest has promised to give an account 
* of himself this morning ; do you ob- 



CASTLE or SANTA MARCO. SS 

*■ serve him, while I, if possible, shall 
' draw him into conversation, and learn 
' the true purport of his business to this 
' country ; for, to be candid with you, 
' from the little I have seen, I like him 
' not, and as to his appearance, it is any 
* thing" but prepossessing.' 

Shortly after they returned to break- 
fastj and found the ladies assembled 
but the monk chose to take the morn- 
ing's repast in his own chamber, and 
sent a respectful intimation to that effect, 
but mentioned his intention of waitina: 
on Sir Edmond in the course of the 
forenoon ; to which the latter returned a 
polite reply. 

Immediately after breakfast the ladies 
retired to the music-room, for the purpose 
of catching a glimpse of the monk as5 
he passed into the library, and as the 
hour approached. Sir Edmond and 
Lord Mortimer felt a degree of anxiety, 
for which they could not account, save, 
that the dark hints, or rather ravings, of 
Gonzales, had excited their curiositj.

SG ALEXENA; on THE 

A little before eleven o'clock, Mon- 
tano descended from his apartment, 
(attended by a domestic,) habited iu 
the dress of his order, and as he parsed 
through the music-room, paused for a 
moment, on seeing the ladies who pre- 
tended to be engaged with various 
musical compositions; but on observing 
the monk, they rose and curtsied ; their 
salutation was returned by Montano, 
who crossed his hands on his bosom, 
and bowed : then fixed his eve on 
Alexena with an inquiring gaze, as if 
tryinjT to recal to his recolleclion the 
countenance of one with whom he had. 
formerly been acquainted. 

From the moment he entered, 
the ladies continued to gaze on him 
with curiosity, awe, and wonder, and 
when the library doors shut him from 
their view, their eyes were rivettcd to 
the spot on which he stood, as if they 
had seen the iiiltiiig shade of some 
supernatural being; nor were the sen- 
sations of Sir. Edmoad and Lord

strange ; the latter started from liis seat, 
and let fall a book which he had been 
reading, without being sensible of his 
awkwardness ; Sir Edmond, however, 
was more collected, he rose, and after 
the first complimentary salutations, in- 
troduced his lordship, and some time 
after begged to know how he felt after 
his recent fatii2:ue. Montano made a 
slight inclination of the head, and in a 
voice, remarkable for the deepness of 
its tone, answered, ' extremely well,* 
and then returned thanks for the atten- 
tion he had received. 

In the course of conversation, he 
touched lightly on the melancholy 
event of the preceding night, and ob- 
served, he felt amply repaid for all 
past hardships, by the good fortune 
that had cast him on the spot to which 
he was bound ; and then requested 
to know how many of the crew had 
been saved. 'I conceived,' said Sir 
Edmond, 'you were informed that one

more only survives, and that he is dan= 
gerouslyill/ 'One only/ cried Montano, 
' what ! have all the rest perished V I 
am heartily grieved, ' It is even so,' re- 
plied Sir Edmond. 'And, pray/ de- 
manded the monk, (as he slowly raised 
his eyes from the floor, and fixed them 
on Sir Edmond, with a deep look of 
inquiry,) what is the name of the sur- 
vivor? I believe he calls himself Gon- 
zales. — Gonzales! echoed Montano, 'it 
is impossible, I saw him sink, I, I — .' He 
paused, and his face almost changed to 
blackness, while his agitation was too 
apparent to escape observation, and was 
instantly noticed by Lord Mortimer, who 
said, 'I assure you, he is the same; he 
' told my servant so, and the first person 
'for whose safetyhe inquired, was your's'. 
His lordship accompanied these words 
with a look that was meant to search 
the very soul of the monk, and it had 
\he momentary eifect of depriving him 
of caution, for he rapidly exclaimed, ' so 
then, the villain is a traitor, and hasbeen 
tampered with :' but the same instant, a.

• hastly smile proclaimed the triumph he 
had regained over his passions, and he 
quickly said, ' I am disturbed, I know 
not what I say ; the incoherency of my 
expressions is owing to the perverse- 
ness of that Gonzales, by whose mis- 
conduct the vessel and her unfortunate 
crew have perished ; and therefore his 
name at this moment, is as peculiarly 
grali iig to my ears, as to my recollection/ 
Lord Mortimer looked doubtingly on 
the monk, who cast a penetrating glance 
of deep inquiry on his lordship, as 
if he demanded his meaning; but the 
former was firm, and Montano with- 
drew his eye, then walked towards a 
window which commanded a view of 
the coast. 

There was now a painful silence; 
Sir Edmoiid, at length, ventured to ask 
the nature of Montano's mission; this 
seemed to relieve all parties; for the 
latter instantly turned from the window, 
and replied, ' he came for the purpose 



50 AI^EXENA; OR THE 

of couiluciino- a young lady, then in 
England, to her friends in Spain.' 

Lord Mortimer now became uneasy 
and alarmed, but suppressed his emo- 
tion, while the monk continued, 'I 
believe she is a relation of your's. Sir 
Edmond; — I mean the lady Alexena de 
Guzman. It was to oblige her family, 
that I have at this time of life left the 
blessed abode of sanctity and peace, 
to encounter all the evils of a tedious 
voyage, and perils of a stormy sea: 
her father has some time ago paid 
the last debt of nature, and her bro- 
thers are anxiously awaiting the return 
of their only sister; poor girl! she is 
now without a parent, and without a 
protector.' ' I beg your pardon, good 
father,' said Lord Mortimer, rather 
warmly; ' Lady Alexena never can 
want a protector; such purity and inno- 
cence as her's, will ever be the peculiar 
care of heaven.' The monk bowed, 
and as he slowly raised his eye to meet 
that of his lordship,, it shot forth a 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 31 

glance, accompanied with a slight 
distortion of the muscles, between a 
sneer and a grin, so undefinablc, yet 
so expressive, that the arch fiend him- 
self would fail in the imitation. As lie 
replied, '1 entirely agree with your 
' lordship; yet as this world isbnrthened

* ing, and oppressed with cares, trou- 

* bles, and misfortunes, the parent of

S2 ALEXENA; OR THE 

' on frail morfality in this vale of tears/ 
Here Montano paused, expecting a 
reply; but Lord Mortimer appeared 
lost in profound thought, and the va- 
cant expression of his look seemed to 
say, he had not heard the conclusion of 
the monk's observations. 

Sir Edmond resumed the subject, by 
inquiring, when it was his intention to 
return to the continent. 'Much depends 
on the I^ady Alexena,' replied the monk, 
' but in three weeks, at farthest, I ex- 
pect to leave this kingdom.' ' Should 
the young lady and her friends be 
averse to part so soon; what then?* 
inquired his lordship. ' Oh ! should 
that be so,' observed Montano, ' I will 
apply to the queen, to whom I have a 
letter, from the Suprema of the most 
holy Inquisition, requiring her majesty 
to send the young lady in safety to her 
friends.' There was now another pause; 
it was evident that not onlv Lord Mor- 
timer, but Sir Edmond, was greatly 



CASTLK OF SANTA MARCO. 33 

shocked at the abrupt threat, or rather 
intimation, of the monk ; for they had 
reason to dread the vengeance of the 
queen, if they openly opposed his 
"wishes, and he not only observed their 
distress, but evinced his joy at it, by 
a gloomy look of malicious exultation. 
To use violent measures might prove 
fetal ; therefore, they resolved to soothe 
the father, and, if possible, induce him 
to prolong his intended journey. Influ- 
enced by this motive. Sir Edinond in- 
formed him^ that Lady Alexena was 
then in the castle; that she was his 
guest, and hoped he would have the 
goodness not to deprive him of such a 
charming visitor, at so early a pe- 
riod as that on which he had fixed for 
his return to Spain. Montano pro- 
mised to gratify him, if in his power, 
and seemed much surprised at finding 
Alexena under the same roof; then 
begged to be introduced to the lady in 
the course of the evening, and observed, 
that it was his intention to conceal her

easy copapliance with Sir EdmontVs

slic;ht degree of hope, that the monk 
might not be actually so bad as their 
fears, Gonzales' hints, and the com-

stranire, that Alexena should have ex- 
cited so ijreat a decree of interest in 
his lordship's heart in so short a period, 
and yet it was evident, his uneasiness 
was solely on her account. ' What is to 
lie done,' said he, as he finnly clasped ,the

Iiand of his friend. Shall I see this Gon- 
zales, and if possible obtain some infor- 
mation about the monk, for whom I must 
acknowledge I have already conceived 
an aversion. 1 have formed an opinion 
by no means in his favor, and fear the 
deep cunning- of his expressive eye ; fw 
has he not appeared here like the flitt- 
ing" shadow of some evil spirit, to mar 
my fair prospects of happiness. It is 
im'possible to elude his keen observance^ 
and conceal the true state of my heart ; 
I love this fair Spaniard too well for my 
peace, and am resolved if I meet with 
the sliirhtest encouraij^emcnt, to mak^ 
her a tender of my hand and fortune^ 
and sl^iould I be supremely blessed by 
her acceptance, 1 trust her brothers 
will have no objection to my alliance. 
I feel an irresistable something that 
binds me to this lovely orphan, utterly 
inexpressible, and should her immense 
fortune present an obstacle, 1 will wii- 
lingly resign it: let the Hj)aniards keep 
their money, I only seek the girl ; as 
vet! fear nothing, save this monk, and

a jealous eye. 

'The Spaniards are proud/ said Sir 
Edinond, laughing-, ' and would rather 
immure their daughters in convents, 
than give them portionless to the arms 
of emperors; but since I find you are so 
deeply smitten, I shall use my every ex- 
ertion in your behalf.' Lord Mortimer 
shook him heartily by the hand, and 
they then went in pursuit of the ladies^ 
who were anxiously expecting an ac- 
count of their interview with the ghostly 
father, and on their entrance, almost 
stunned them with a volume of questi- 
ons. Sir Edmond, in reply, merely said, 
' Montano was a messenger from Spain, 
sent to convey Alexena to her relatives, 
in the course of a month or two, when 
she should feel inclined to undertake 
so fatiguing a journey. Alexena heard 
this news without any particular sensa- 
tion of joy or giief. Home had few 
pleasures for her; she had not seen her 
father more than three times since she 



CASTLE OP SANTA MAttCO. ST 

attained her fourth year, and then only 
for half an hour at a time in the parlour 
of the convent^ where she had been 
educated. 

Shortly after the bigotted Mary had 
ascended the throne of England, Miss 
Hastings, the aunt of Alexena (who was 
a maiden lady then about forty,) went 
to Madrid for the express purpose of 
bringing her niece to London, and as 
the former was in possession of a splen- 
did fortune, the father of Alexena 
thought it prudent to assent to this visit. 
Miss Hastings was kindly and hospitably 
received by her brother-in-law, and 
having remained with him a month, 
left Spain accompanied by her niece, 
whom she loved most affectionately, and 
treated with every mark of attention. 

Alexena, notwithstanding she had 
been in England three years, spoke 
the language of the country very im- 
perfectly, w hich, with a slight lisp, gave 
a pleasing intonation to her voice, that 
made hdr accent highly interesting to 



SS ALE3CEXA ; en THB 

a stranger. She ^vas tofally unac- 
quainted wifli Uie wiles of (he world, 
and her mind was as pure and innocent, 
as her form was lovely. Wherever 
she went, she had the 'witcliinq- charm 
of creatiu!;, not merely admiration, ])ut 
a wish to please, serve, and oblii^e her. 
Her foreign accent, sweet plaintiveness 
of manner, and endearing disposition, 
f^ecured her the universal esteem of both 
sexes. Such was the lovclvbeins: who 
was shortly to be placed under the 
protection of Montano the monk: A 
Villain, on whose bvow every rice (hat 
disgraces man, appears to have been 
written in legible characters. No won- 
der, therefore. Lord Mortimer should 
feel uneasy at this approaching event, 
for it cannot be denied, that there is 
something in the countenance and ad- 
dress of almost every man. that in a 
{rreater or lesser decree commends him 
to our favor, or renders him suspicious. 



It is lordship had seen Alexena in all 
her charjus ; he iiad also seen tlic monk. 



GASTLE OF SANTA 2IAT.C0. $9 

— and trembled for her ?afoty. She 
indeed felt no fears, and looked forward 
to her return to Spain vilhont any 
feeling', save that of regret. She had 
been too Ions: in the jrav world to wish 
to part with it so soon, or exchange it 
for the dull '^routine of a convent, 
though her natural disposition led her 
io prefer the domestic fireside to the 
f^aieties of the crondcd assembly. Her 
father's mansion had never proved that 
kind home to her, where the sweet 
soothings of a parent smoothed her bed 
of sickness, or where the tender atten- 
tions of dear relatives served to make 
the solitary hours of ennui, glide by un- 
observed. She had been brought from 
the gloomy cloister to the stiil more 
gloomy palace of her father, to see her 
aunt ; and where, save that lady, no 
other female ever appeared since her 
mother's death. 

There were a few domestics, whose 
manners partook of the gravity by 
which they were surrounded, and v>hosc 
avocations in life rendered them un- 



it) alexexa; or the 

suitable companions for a lovely, and 
a high-born Spaniard — and these were 
the only inmates of her father's house. 

Alexena was susceptable of every 
feeling- of gratitude, but was as yet a 
strano'er to that most delightful of our 
passions — Love. She had not then seea 
Lord Mortimer, the most facinating", 
the most honorable of men, but when 
that moment arrived, she felt a parti- 
cular degree of pleasure in his society, 
and a kind of lassitude in his absence, 
which, in a little time, rendered hinn 
very dear to her; and she then began 
to have some idea of that sweet, but 
alarming, passion. In the privacy of 
her chamber she questioned herself 
relative to the nature of her feelings, 
and burst into tears on discovering the 
real state of her heart, but they were 
not painful tears. She could not tell 
what caused them, and yet they flowed. 
Was Lord Mortimer the cause? Yes! 
Was he negligent in paying any of 
those polite attentions which are ex- 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 41 

pected, and are the peculiar right of 
every lovely and virtuous female? cer- 
tainly not. On the contrary, he was 
most delicately attentive, and it was 
evident those attentions were particu- 
larly offered to herself. Did Lord Mor- 
timer love her with all the honorable 
feeling of a noble nature, her heart res- 
ponsively answered, 'Most assuredly.' 
* Yes!' she cried, ' he does, and have I 
not reason to be happy.' 

Such were the thoughts of the lovely 
Alexena, about a fortnight after the 
arrival of the monk; but in her review 
of them, she, for that time, overlooked 
the nature of the father's mission to 
Hollywood-Castle. — But to return from 
this digression. Lord Mortimer in a 
short time became a favourite with her, 
and deservedly so, for he might be said 
to live on her looks. Whenever she 
sung the plaintive airs of her country, 
he hung over her chair with fond solici- 
tude, and became enraptured with the 
sweetness of her voice, and the exquisite 



43 alexena; on the 

pathos of lier expression. At tlio^e 
moments his soul beamed in his eyes^ 
and when seated by Alexena^ he forgot 
the world and its cares. 

The monk, however, often intruded 
on those golden moments, and already 
they beheld each other with evident 
diso:ust. Montano hated his lordship, 
without being able to explain the 
reason, even to himself, and the latter 
disliked him for these frequent imper' 
tinent intrusions. 

in about eight days after the iater- 
I'iew between Montano and SirEdmond, 
Gonzales grew much worse, and his 
medical atierjdants were of opinion that 
he could not long survive ; they there- 
fore recommended him to prepare for 
the last awful change, and tlie monl: 
was directly summoned to his chamber, 
where he remained about an Iioin*, and 
on his return was evidently much dis- 
tui'bed. 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 43 

Sliortlj after,, Ronrke ^vaited on his 
lord with a message from llie dying man^ 
in Avliich he expressed a wish (o see him 
immediately Lord Mortimer instantly 
pbeyed the summons, aiid accompanied 
Tom to his apartment. On enterini:^ 
it, the dying' Gonzales raised himself 
iti his bed, and havino: returned thanks 
to his lordsiiip for his past kindness, 
said, ' he had something of particular 
consequence to communicate respect- 
ing the Lady Alexena/ 

His lordship instantly ordered Ronrke 
(o with(haw, and having secured the 
door, sat down in anxious expectation 
of hearing this disclosure. 

After a pause of a few moments, 
Gonzales began by a prefatory caution 
against the wiles of the monk, and drew 
his character in colours of the deepest 
sliade ; then gave him a circumstantial 
detail of Don Velasco's death, and of 
his will, saying, that he himself had 



44 ALEXENA : OR THE 



been a domestic in the family of his late 
lord, upwards of twenty years, and 
that his knowledge of the character of 
Montano, was his sole inducement for 
taking such a long, and, as it proved, 
fatal journey ; for he apprehended the 
safety of his young mistress was confided 
to a dangerous guardian, and therefore 
resolved to brave every peril for her 
sake. 

He was about to enter into the ex- 
planation of the cause of requiring his 
lordship's attendance, when the door 
-slowly unclosed, and Gonzales pointed 
to the lonjr sraunt fi«>:ure of the monk, 
who stood with outstretched neck at 
the entrance, and had evidently been 
listening, from the fury that sparkled 
in his eyes. His pale and quivering 
lip and agitated figure, proved his bale- 
ful intentions, and when he found he 
was observed, he sprung forward with 
all the active ferocity of a tyger, crying, 
' Villain ! slave ! traitor ! this to thy 



CiiJTLE OP SANTA MARCO. 45 

lieart !' and had he not been prevented 
hy Lord Mortimer, would have sheathed 
his stiletto in the bosom of Gonzales. 
Twice he essayed to wrest the dagger 
from his lordship's grasp, who, being at 
length fatiojued with the struggle, and 
enraged at the monk's depravity, by a 
well directed bloWj laid him prostrate 
at his feet. 

Gonzales anxiously beheld the con- 
test ; but the moment Montano fell, 
the former burst into a long convulsive 
iaugh, conceiving he was slain, and 
shouting, cried, ^ already the demons 
of darkness have seized him !' then fell 
into a fit, and instantly expired. 

The blow had stunned Montano, but 
he quickly recovered, and on rising, was 
thrust from the room by Lord Mortimer, 
who, at the same time, called loudly for 
assistance ; but it was too late — Gon- 
zales was lifelessj and his secret died 
with him. 



4G alexena; or the 

From that moment the revengefui 
monk became imjDlacable, and had 
Lord Mortimer a thousand lives^ and 
he the power, he would have stabbed 
them all; his malice was of the most 
fell and dcuclly nature; ungovernable, 
unquenchable, and all attempts to ap- 
pease it were attended with the same 
etiect, as that of castinij oil on burninir 
embers, only serving- to make them 
blaze with increasing fury. 

Lord Mortimer then sought Sir Ed- 
mond, and related this atrocious at- 
tempt of Montano, and orders were 
instantly issued for his arrest; but it 
was too late; he had passed the draw- 
bridge, and was no where to be found. 
His lordship rejoiced at the circum- 
stance; and as day after day passed 
without any tidings of him. Sir Edmond 
and his friend hoped he had returned 
to Spain, and that they were rid of him 
for ever.

Under the which he shall not choose, but fail.'* 

Hamlet. 

-i HREE weeks had flitted away inoyt 
agreeably since Montano had quitted 
the mansion of Sir Edniond, and was 
almost forgotten ; when one evening as 
the happy inmates of the castle were 
enjoying the amnsernents of cards and 
chess, a domestic announced, "^the war- 
der was summoned to admit messengers 
from the queen.' Sir Edmond instantly 
appeared on the ramparts, and de- 
manded the nature of their business, 
and was answered in the well-known 
voice of an old friend, whom he recog- 
nised as Sir William Hunt, and imme- 
diately ordered them to be admitted. 

Sir William was attended by a nu- 
merous train, chiefly guards, and amon^' 
the group. Sir Edmond recognised 
the monk, whose ghastly looks and 



48 ALEXCJTA ; OR THE 

Bcowling eyes, marked the triumphant 
villainy of his hearty and had he 
been accompanied by any other officer, 
the mind of the former would have 
been almost distracted by apprehen- 
sion ; but fortunately Sir William had 
been chosen to execute the wishes of 
the wily INIontano; and though he 
could not avoid doing his duty, yet he 
had the power to grant those indulg-en- 
cies which it would be absurd to expect 
from a stranger. 

When the soldiers bad retired to 
seek refreshment, and the monk had 
been shewn to his chamber. Sir Ed- 
mond led the way to his study, accom- 
panied by Lord Mortimer and Sir 
W^illiam; where the latter informed 
them, he came for the purpose of ar- 
lestin": a ladv, named Alexena de 
Guzman, to see her on board a ves- 
sel prepared for her reception, already 
lying off the coast, and send her under 
an escort to Spain. ' To-morrow/ be

continued, 'she must embark, and I 
earnestly beg that neither of" you will 
interfere/ Here the colour of Lord 
Mortimer's cheek vied with the lily ; 
but he revived on observing- the playful 
archness of Sir William's countenance, 
who, smiling, said, ' my friend Henri 
' Bolerno, the lady's cousin, who is now 
*at court, in confidence imparted the 
' state of your lordship's heart, and if you 
' are as serious as I apprehend you are^ 
' I think I have it in my power to serve 
'you; what say you to the appointment 
' of captain of this escort? the monk 
* need know nothing of it till after your 
' embarkation, and then his opposition 
'to the measure will be vain; should it 
'transpire hereafter, and the queen hear 
' it, I must pretend total ignorance, and 
' I trust all will be well.' Sir William 
paused, and Lord Mortimer clasped 
him to his breast; indeed, some mo- 
ments elapsed ere he could restrain his 
joy, or return suitable thanks. It was 
judged necessary, instantly to commu- 
nicate the purport of Sir William's 

VOL. I. c 



60 ALEXEVA ; on THE 

visit to Miss Hastings^ and which was 
accordingly done by Sir Edmond; she 
was shocked at the violence of the 
measure, but at once declared her de- 
termination of accompanying Alexena, 
if she should not act in direct opposi- 
tion to the mandate of the queen. Sir 
William was ao^ain consulted, and as 
he had not received any intimation on 
the subject, he, without hesitation, com- 
mended the propriety of her intention. 
The time being short, preparations and 
arrangements were instantly made for 
their voyage, yet the utmost secrecy 
was observed. Orders were issued for 
packing dresses, valuables, and all other 
necessaries ; while musical instruments, 
and drawing materials were got in 
readiness, to soothe the weary hours 
that must necessarily intervene before 
they reached the continent. 

At two o'clock in the afternoon of the 
following day, Alexena went on board, 
accompanied by Montano. Miss Hast- 
ings, Lord Morfimer, and their attend- 
ants;, having reached the ship in a boat

an hour before, without the monk hav- 
ing the slightest intimation of their in- 
tention, and they were many leagues 
at sea, ere the blustering Rourke 
disclosed to the enraged father, his 
master was commandant, and that 
the master of the vessel had received 
instructions to obey him in every tiling; 
but this was not exactly correct, as the 
ship was bound for Spain, and the pilot 
had been ordered to steer direct for 
that country; but the injunction was 
unnecessary, as Lord Mortimer woidd 
rather forfeit life and happiness than 
injure his friend. The wind being 
favorable, the voyage was prosperous, 
and his lordship felt regret when the 
mariners descried the coast, as he never 
had been happier, having enjoyed 
the society of his beloved Alexena 
without interruption ; while the monk 
was engaged apart, brooding mis- 
chief, and plotting destruction on them 
all. After they had landed, his lord- 
ship wrote a detail of their voyage to 
Sir Edmond, and then dismissed the 

c3 



5f ALliXENA; OR THE 

master of the vessel^ with many sub- 
stantial marks of his favor. It was 
now arranged by Miss Hastings^ that 
they should proceed by easy stages to 
Madrid, and on their arrival, she hoped 
to have sufficient influence with young 
Velasco, to obtain his consent to his 
sister's marriage with his lordship, who 
Lad made a tender of his hand and 
fortune to the lovely Alexena the night 
before she left Hollywood-Castle, and 
had the good fortune to be received in 
a manner that left him every thing to 
hope, if he could obtain her brother's 
consent. On the second day of their 
journey, Montano abruptly quitted 
them, without assigning any. causCj, 
which gave Lord Mortimer consider- 
able uneasiness; he feared the monk's 
power, and his malice, without tlse pos- 
sibility of preventing either, and there- 
fore took the precaution of doubling 
the guards of his escort, which, he trust- 
ed, would prevent any private attack 
that might be meditated. In ten days, 
they arrived at Madrid, and Misg 
Hastings instantly despatched a billet

to Don Velasco^ expressiiiiif her wish to 
see him in the course of the evening-, 
if not particularly engaged. In a short 
time, her messenger returned, accompa- 
nied hy a servant, who stated, his mas- 
ter had left the city a week before, for 
the purpose of going to Barcelona, to 
meet Lady Alexena, Lord Mortimer 
did not give credit to a sentence of this, 
but concealed his doubts from the 
ladies, while he cautioned both Rourke 
and Albert to be extremely watchful, 
and not to leave the hotel on any ac- 
count, even for a moment. 

The following evening, his lordship 
went into the interior of the city, for 
the purpose of delivering some letters to- 
a friend of Bolerno's, and who he was 
fortunate enough to find at home; on 
enterino' into conversation with this 
gentleman, he faimd he had every 
thing to fear from the character of young 
Velasco, who was the most abandoned 
noble in Madrid, and it was pretty 
generally understood, that he had dissi- 
pated a large fortune in a few months, by 



.54 ALEXENA ; on THK 

Lis iinconti'ouled and excessive love for 
play; and as to Montano, who had lat- 
terly been confessor in the family, little 
was known, only his austere habits, and 
apparent sanctity were suspected to be 
feijrned. 



'O' 



The dusky shades of night had 
darkened the horizon, before his lord- 
ship was aware of the lateness of 
the hour; he now hastily arose, and 
after returning- thanks to his new friend, 
hurried towards his hotel, angry with 
himself for the uneasiness he had caused 
Alexena and Miss Hastings. The night 
was mild, and now and then his atten- 
tion was attracted by the reflection of 
the moon's pale rays on the variegated 
glass of the cathedrals ; but he had not 
then time, minutely to examine their 
beauties; Alexena engaged his every 
thought, and he cursed the folly that had 
detained him so much beyond his usual 
liour; but on turning into a street near 
the Casa del Campo, judge his rage and 
T€xation^ on being surrounded by a

number of armed men, who rushed 
from an adjacent building", and sur- 
rounded him in an instant. As it was 
in vain to contend with sucli a number 
of opponents, he made no resistance, 
but quietly resigned his sword to the 
captain or chief officer, who had fiercely 
demanded it; and was then conducted 
by his guards through several streets, 
to the wing of a large building, at a 
small grated door of which, they loudly 
knocked for admission. The same in- 
stant, a kind of covered carriage or 
litter drove up, escorted by troopers, 
and tliougli there were a considerable 
number of persons on tlie spot, not a 
sentence was uttered by any of them. 
Lights seemed to pass to and fro within, 
and, in a little time, a heavy iron gat€ 
was thrown open, and the carriage 
passed into a dark court, from which a 
lady was assisted to alight, by a person 
dressed in a loni^ black robe. Thelii^ht 
of the torches was not sufficiently strong 
to enable Lord Mortimer to have a 
distinct view of her countenance, but 



56 ALEXENA; OR THE 

)ie had seen enough, to convince him it 
was handsome ; he could not, however, 
divine the meaning of so much cere- 
mony, but was not long kept in sus- 
pense ; the little grated door ojiened, 
and his guard conveyed him through 
several winding passages into a dark 
cell, without letting him know whether 
it contained a bed or any other article 
of furniture. On requesting a lamp, his 
gaoler gazed on him in evident sur- 
prise, then with a horrid grin, motioned 
silence, and pushed him into his prison, 
securely locking the door after him. 

Lord Mortimer leaned against the 
"wall until he became fatigued stand- 
ing, and at length began to grope 
about for a chair or somethinsr to sit 
on, but was almost petrified with 
horror, on clasping a human skeleton 
in his arms, that hung dangling from 
the ceiling; he fled from its musty em- 
brace to a corner of the cell, and sat 
down on the damp floor; on recovering 
the powers of reflection, he felt assured 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 57 

lie was then in the dungeons of the 
Inquisition^ and that Montano was the 
cause. He was roused from a kind of 
stupor, by approaching' footsteps, and 
in a few moments his gaoler entered, 
attended by two mutes, who conducted 
him down several fiiohts of stairs, and 
throuijh a Ions: subterraneous avenue, 
into an apartment of the most gloomy 
description ; the wails were covered 
with black cloth, on which were painted 
death's heads, while the fleshless hands 
of real skeletons held burning black 
wax tapers; skulls were converted into 
lamps, from which the pale and sickly 
light issued at those orifices, where once 
eyes, perhaps, tlic eyes of beauty, 
beamed wish resplendent loveliness. 
There was a cold chill air which played 
in strong currents through those regions 
of terror, that was almost sufficient to 
freeze the blood, if there had not been 
many other ways of staying its circula- 
tion. His lordship, though as brave a 
a man as any in existence, could not be- 
hold this chamber of despair without 

c5 



58 ALEXENAJ OR THE 

being moved; but his thoughts suc- 
ceeded each other with such rapidity 
from the novelty of his situation, that 
lie. could not tell what he either saw 
or felt, and was at length awakened 
out of a kind of trance, by the Vicar 
General's orders, — ' that he should be 
brought forward, and answer truly, 
every question that would be asked, 
without prevarication, equivocation, or 
hesitation, as he hoped for mercy/ 
The mutes now led him forward to 
the table, at which the secretary sat, 
ready to note down his answers, 
Ihe questions being already entered. 
Above the secretary sat the Vicar 
General, with two other inquisitors, all 
habited in black, and at each of the 
eight difl'erent entrances to the hall, 
stood two familiars, bearing torches, 
awaiting the signals of those men of 
fate. 

After a pause of a few minutes, the 
secretary handed Lord Mortimer a 
book, on the cover of which were many 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 59 

mystical characters, and having sworn 
him to tell the truth, he demanded his 
name, to which he answered, ' My 
name is Frederick Mortimer, called in 
England^ Lord Mortimer, and I am a 
viscount.' 'What!' said the Vicar Ge- 
neral, starting on his feet, 'dare yon pre- 
sume to deceive us in our judgment-seat, 
by giving a feigned name, and adopt- 
ing a foreign language! speak Spanish, 
or 1 will make you speak it on the rack !* 
' I assure you, I cannot," said his lord- 
ship; *1 addressed yon in French, be- 
cause I was aware 1 should be under- 
stood, and, on my life, I have declared 
the truth ; my servants are now at an 
hotel ill this city, and if you take the 
trouble, you can easily be convinced 
there is some mistake in this matter.' 
The inquisitors again paused, and con- 
sulted each other, in a whisper, for a few 
moments, then made a sign to one of 
the officials, who instantly disappeared, 
but immediately returned, leading in a 
female, closely veiled ; her figure was 
elegant, and her height that of Alexena, 



60 ALEXENA ; OR THE 

His lordsliip trembled with emotion ; he 
feared it was her, and that the monk 
MontanOj had laid some desperate plot 
to ruin both. The inquisitors observed 
liis frequent change of countenance, 
and ordered the familiars to take oif the 
lady's veil ; when^ to his evident sur- 
prise, he beheld, instead of Alexena, a 
lovely stranger, whom, from what he 
had seen, he conceived to be the fe- 
male conveyed there that evening". 
The Vicar General now addressed 
Evelene, and commanded her to tell 
the name of the person then present, 
and pointed to his lordship. She in- 
stantly raised her eyes to his expres- 
sive face, and started on beholdin<r 
him ; then said, ' I have not the honor 
of knowing this gentleman/ 'Gra- 
cious Powers!' exclaimed the second 
inquisitor, ' what perverseness : why 
deny a fact so notorious? 'As wliat!* 
timidly demanded Evelene. k familiar 
now laid his finoer on his mouth, as an 
order to be silent, and again the in- 
quisitors consulted each other; they 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. Gi 

spoke too low to be overheard, and 
while they yet conversed, a bell tolled ; 
instantly the Vicar General descended 
from the tribunal, and hurried through 
a distant door; but in a moment re- 
turned, and after he had said a few 
words to his brother inquisitors, again 
demanded Lord Mortimer's name, and 
was answered as before. Instantly a 
si^-nal was 2:iven, and he was led from 
the hall into a plain chamber, where he 
was cautioned by a monk, if he valued 
his existence, to keep secret what he 
had seen, and tliat he should be con- 
ducted in safety to his hotel. His lord- 
ship promised every thing^ required of 
him, and was innncdiately after placed 
in one of the litters belonging to the 
Inquisition, and about two o'clock in 
the morning, found himself once more 
under the roof with Alexena, who had 
watched the moments of his absence 
with the greatest inquietude. Ronrke 
was almost frantic with joy, when 
he saw his lord safe again ; he cursed, 
criedj sung, and laughed^ in the course 



63 ALEXENA ; OR THE 

of a minute, and appeared absolutely 
mad^ but in a few moments aftei^ being 
called by his lordship, he grew more 
composed, and when in his presence, 
restrained his feelings^ because they 
were the genuine effusions of an affec- 
tionate heart, and he was too proud, as 
a man, to wish to impress on his master 
the true state of his thoughts. 

The Rev. Mr. Jones, the clergyman, 
who has been mentioned as one of the 
guests of Sir Edmond Hastings, accom- 
panied Lord Mortimer to Spahi, and was 
a valuable acquisition, as he spoke the 
language most fluently. On the night 
after his lordship had been confined 
in the Inquisition, Mr. Jones went into 
the city for the purpose of gleaning the 
news of the day, and in the course of 
an hour, returned with the alarming 
intelligence, that a nobleman named 
Don Vitelli, had been assassinated in 
the same street in which Lord Morti- 
mer was arrested a very few moment* 
before; and that it was generally be- 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. G3 

lieved^ the dago^ers of the murderers 
had mistaken their victim, and that the 
wretched Vitelli had fallen in his stead. 
The Inquisition had taken cognizance 
of the affair, and one of the assassins 
had luckily been apprehended ; so the 
most sanguine hopes were entertained 
that the principals would meet the 
punishment they so well deserved. 

When Lord Mortimer had heard this 
relation, an unaccountable something 
impressed his mind with ttufe idea that he 
was the object for whom the stillettos of 
the villains had been intended, and the 
more he dwelt on this idea, it became 
the more firmly impressed on his mind, 
and he resolved, if he should be able to 
produce any proof, to use every exertion 
in discovering whether young Velasco 
was the instigator of this diabolical 
attempt. Lord Mortimer next morn- 
ing made many inquiries in the city, 
but without being able to obtain any- 
satisfactory information. Report said, 
the nobleman who had been assassi- 



64 ALEXENA ; OR THE 

nated;, incurred the displeasure of the 
holy tribunal, for heresy, and that 
the Lady Evelene was involved in his 
crime, by having- become a convert to 
his opinions. Towards evening, how- 
ever, it was rumoured that his lordship 
had hired the murderers, who had mis- 
taken the unfortunate Vitelli for Don 
Velasco, and the reputed cause as- 
signed for the commission of this 
atrocious deed, was, that the latter had 
refused his consent to his sister's mar- 
riage with his lordship. This was really 
alarming, and might be attended by 
the most fatal consequences; it removed 
every doubt from the mind of Lord 
Mortimer, which yet existed^ with 
respect to Montano, who he now felt 
firmly convinced was the detestable 
and bloody author of the late tragedy. 
He communicated his sus|)icions and 
Lis fears to Jones, who advised him to 
leave Madrid instantly, as his life was 
in imminent danger; but to this he 
would by no means assent, while his 
fears for the ladies reduced his njind 



» 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 65 

to a state Utile short of distraction. 
Miss Hastings obsci ved his uneasiness, 
and pressed him for an explanation of 
the cause; he then in confidence im- 
parted every thing he either knew or 
suspected. She was greatly shocked 
at the villainy of the monk, and at 
once resolved to press her niece to ac- 
company her to Saragossa, where a 
relation resided, and from thence, re- 
turn by Taragonna, to England, as it 
vs^ould be next to madness to leave her 
under the brutal controul of her bro- 
ther. Miss Hastings had paid a few 
visits to those friends with whom she 
had formed an intimacy when last in 
the Spanish capital, and from them 
learned the true character of her aban- 
doned nephew, which she now resolved 
to inform Alexena of, as it was neces- 
sary to her peace and safety. 

A!exena,on hearing: the sad narrative of 
Velasco's monstrous depravity, and that 
her younger brother Antonio was then in 
Grenada, with his regiment, she at once 



66 ALEXENA ; on THE 

resolved to accompany her aunt ; and 
the clanger of Lord Mortimer induced 
her to intreat Miss Hastings to leave 
Madrid the following day. When his 
lordship was informed that she wislied 
to quit the city as soon as possible^ he 
gave orders to Rourke^ to have every 
thing in readiness at an early hour next 
morning; but it seemed, the inquisitors 
were resolved not to let him depart so 
soon^ for he was again arrested, and 
conducted before that dread tribui\al. 
However, on his arrival, instead of being 
thrust into a dark cell, he was conduct- 
ed to a comfortable chamber, and in 
half an hour after followed one of the 
familiars to the Hall of Judgment, 
where ev'ery object presented the same 
gloomy horrors, and where all was 
silent as the tomb. He was a^ain 
sworn, and then ordered not to utter a 
sentence, except when spoken to ; his 
lordship bowed assent, and the mo- 
ment after, one of the inquisitors touch- 
ed a bell. Two mutes now entered, 
leading' in the Lady Evelene; and two 



-5>- 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARC0. 67 

familiars, with a ruffian, whose arms 
were bound with cords. The Vicar 
General then ordered Lord Mortimer 
to read his deposition of the preceding 
night, and sign it, which he instantly 
did. Evelene received the like com- 
mand, and obeyed ; then the deposition 
of the assassin of Vitelli was read to 
him, and when sworn, he affirmed it 
to be true. Lord Mortimer heard it 
with surprise and horror, as it stated 
he was the person who had induced 
the wretch to murder Vitelli, having mis- 
taken him for Don Velasco, and that 
he had pointed out the deceased, by 
exclaiming, 'that's he;' at which the 
ruffians stabbed him in the back with 
stillettos, inflicting four mortal wounds, 
that caused his instant death. 

In answer to a quere, as to his belief, 
what had induced Lord Mortimer, a 
total stranger, to perpetrate such a 
bloody deed, or cause it to be done, 
he answered, ' that from the conversa- 
' tioii of his comrades, he had been led 



68 alexena; or the 

' to believe, that the hopes of being, 
' married to Don Velasco's sister wag 
' the motive^ and which covdd not take 
' place while he lived, as she was de- 

* voted to a monastic life, by the will of 
'her father, and her brother had re- 
' ceived strict injunctions to see his will, 

* in that respect, carried into immediate 
' execution. Scalto,* was then ordered 
to affix his sio^nature, which he did with- 
out hesitation, and delivered his depo- 
sition into the hands of the secretary. 
The inquisitors now consulted a mo- 
ment, and then the Vicar General ad- 
dressed Scalto thus: 'Thou wretch! 
' that hast the hardihood and want of 
^ grace, to depose on your oath a vilc' 

* and infamous falshood, even within 
•■ the pale of this most sacred court, 
*■ say what have you to ofler, thou man 
' of blood \ why your polluted body 
' may not be delivered to the torments 

* of the wheel : know that the olijecl, 
^ who, by your deposition, you iu- 
' tended to destroy, stood on this spot 

*■ The ruffian's name. 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 69 

' at the very moment you have sworn he 
'pointed out the murdered V'iteili/ The 
villain was not prepared for this blow, 
and continued silent until the toll of the 
bell brought four horrible officials to 
bear him to the question. He then fell 
on his knees, and drew from his bosom 
a scroll, purporting to be a protection 
from one of the inquisitors. This ex- 
cited considerable confusion, as the in- 
strument, on examination, appeared 
genuine ; but it was necessary to ascer- 
tain the fact, and the inquisitor, sup- 
posed to have signed it, was instantly 
summoned. In a few moments he ap- 
peared, and at once denied all know- 
ledire of it. The criminal then affirmed 
it had been given to him by Montano, 
one of the Dominican fathers. Here 
the inquisitors seemed perplexed, but 
issued an order for his appearance, and 
in less than half an hour he entered (he 
hall. The hood of his gown concealed 
the expression of his features, but on 
throwing ft back, he was almost petrified 
.son beholding Lord Mortimer and Scalto 



70 ALEXENA; OR THE 

confronted, (a circumstance very un- 
usual,) yet the subtile monk speedily re- 
covered his presence of mind, and in a 
moment determined how he should act. 
After being called and sworn, his name 
and order was entered, and thentheVicar 
General desired the secretary to pro- 
duce the scroll, and demanded had he 
ever seen it : he replied, ' Never !' — 
(To a question from an Inquisitor,) 

* Do you know this man, named Scalto, 
' or have you seen him before ? — 
' Montano,' 'Certainly not.' — 'Oh ! you 
villain,' exclaimed the infuriated assas- 
' sin, ' you first induced me to commit 
' this crime, and now you leave me to 

• perish. Lord Mortimer is the object 
' of your hate, and in an evil hour I 
' became the instrument of your ven- 
' geance; therefore, 1 deserve my fate, 
' and should die satisfied if you meet the 
'just reward of your enormities.' Here 
the inquisitors commanded him to be si- 
lent, on pain of instant torture, and then 
demanded what Montano had to offer in 

Ins defence. The monk, with a feigned 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 71 

look of surprise, observed^ ' that he had 
' not an idea of what the prisoner stated, 
' and that he relied on the justice of the 
' holy tribunal. His character, it was 
' true, had been impeached by the fran- 
' tic ravings of a condemned assassin, 
' but, he trusted, his pure and spotless 
' reputation was proof against the hid- 
' den malice of any enemies he might 
' have.' He was then ordered to an 
adjacent cell, to await the determina- 
tion of the court, and the miserable 
tool of his villainy, was instantly con- 
demned to be broke on the wheel. Eve- 
lene was led from the hall, and Lord 
Mortimer having been again cautioned^ 
was conducted in safety to his hotel; 
b..t as he followed the familiars through 
the windings of the subterraneous dun- 
geons, he heard the shrieks of the suf- 
fering wretch, who had already been 
delivered into the hands of the execu- 
tioner. On his return, he found Alex- 
ena and Miss Hastings almost paralized 
with fear on his account, and could 
only quiet them by his solemn promise 



72 alexena; or tiie 

to leave Madrid next morning. Every 
thing' was prepared by Albert and 
Rourke, but it was necessary that tlie 
ladies should recruit their weary spirits 
with a few hours repose, of which they, 
as well as his lordship^ stood much iu 
need.

At five o'clock the following- morn- 
ms:. Lord Mortimer sent Albert forward 
to prepare fresh relays of horses at the 
different stages that intervene between 
Madrid and Guadalaxara, with a proper 
route and instructions, to enable him 
to avoid mistakes, and at eight, he 
followed, accompanied by Alexena and 
Miss Hastings. Mr, Jones remained 
in the city, as he had business to trans- 
act, but promised to make all possible 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 75 

haste, to join them at Saragossa. The 
weather was clear, though cold, yet 
not disagreeable, so they travelled with 
much pleasure, enjoying a delightful 
view of the country through which they 
passed. At dusk, they reached a small 
inn, within two leagues of Brihuega, 
where they resolved to remain that 
night, and were much better accom- 
modated than the appearance of the 
place gave them a right to expect. 
Lord Mortimer trusted there was little 
danger of a pursuit from Montano, 
who, he hoped, would be obliged io 
remain a few days in the Inquisition, 
before his tardy superiors should think 
proper to make any further inquiries 
about Vitelli's death. Albert, as he 
proceeded, procured either mules or 
horses without much difficulty, and 
continued to keep some leagues in 
advance, but with this precaution, that 
he always took care to calculate where 
jt was most likely his lord would pass 
the night, and there he awaited 
his arrival. Lord Mortimer, in the 

TOL. f. D 



74: alexena; or the 

course of the next clay, tried his utmost 
powers of persuasion, to induce Alex- 
ena to consent to their immediate union, 
and Miss Hastings had the goodness 
to join his lordship, and observed, that 
her brother Velasco was too worthless 
and abandoned to have any just claim 
on her affection, or to render it neces- 
sary to consult him on this important 
subject; and at length, their united 
exertions prevailed. Alexena consented, 
and promised to bestow her hand on 
the now happy Mortimer, when they 
should arrive at the little town of 
Siguenca. His lordship kissed her hand, 
and declared that it should be the future 
study of his existence to repay her for 
so much goodness, and that he hoped 
the remainder of his life would prove 
the sincerity of his heart, by rendering 
her happy. They now approached 
that hour in which the beetle

As oft h e rises 'midst the twilight path 

Against the pilgrim borne iu heedless hum." 

A mountain's brown sides skirted the 



CASTLE OF SANTA MAHCO. 75 

road, which were covered at unequal 
distances with dark groves of pine, 
above which the jiroiid spires of a 
convent reared their lofty heads, and 
■were distin"uishable at intervals in the 
momentary breaks of the woods. About 
a mile further it appeared to emerge 
from the deep shade, and burst on 
the astonished sense in all the majestic 
awfulness of gloomy grandeur. His 
lordship inquired the name of this 
immense pile, as it was evident there 
were two distinct buildings, though 
_ adjoining each other, and was answered 
by one of his Spanish guides, (in bad 
French,) that they were the monastery 
and convent of the Dominicans, re- 
nowned for sanctity and the severity of 
their discipline; they are, continued 
the guide, ' some of the oldest institu- 
tions in Spain; I have heard many- 
dreadful stories of them, but indeed so 
horrible, that I should not like to either 
hear or repeat them again.' Alexena 
shudderedj and grew very pale ; Lord

Mortimer motioned the guide to be 
silent^ and in a whisper, in treated to 
know the cause of her fears. ' Oh!' she 
replied, 'this is the dreadful convent 
' in which my father often vowed to 
' confine me, if I ever disputed his will, 

* and I now have a strange prcsenti- 
' ment of evil.' Lord Mortimer tried 
to laugh away her fears, he soothed 
and used every little art to relieve her 
mind from such idle fancies, and pressed 
the guides to hasten forward, that they 
might reach a shelter for the night. 
One of them instantly observed, ' that 

* there was a monastery of Benedictiue 
' monks about two miles further, and 
' within a mile of Siguenca, who were 

* very hospitable, and would willingly 

* render every accommodation in their 
' power; but if you should not like this,' 
he continued, ' there is a small house 
' near it, on a common, the owner of 
^ which is a verv honest man, who is 
■^always provided with necessaries for 
^ travellers, and will do his utmost to

CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 77 

' make you comfortable.' ' We will' 
go there!' said his lordship, 'shall we 
not, ladies.' 'Oh! yes. Oh! yes/ ex- 
claimed Alexena, with an approviu'^ 
smile, ' if my aunt will have the good- 
ness to consent, for I have an uncon- 
querable aversion to monks, nuns, friars, 
and every thing appertaining to, or 
connected with them.' Miss Hastinsfs 
laughingly said, 'you see ray lord, this 
' young lady's way of thinking is 
' greatly changed, she would now much 
' rather be a wife than a nun.' ' The 

* former, I hope to make her this night, 

* if it shall please God,' replied his 
lordship, ' as I mean to claim her 
' promise, being within a short dis- 
' tance of the town where I expect 
' to be made the happiest of men.' 
Alexena blushed deeply, but made no 
reply; and in a few moments they 
reached the inn on the common. 

After Lord Mortimer had given or- 
ders for supper, he made many inquiries 
about the little town of Siguenca 



78 ALEXENA; OR THE 

which was in the neighbourhood, and 
asked Anselmo, ' could a priest be found 
there, if necessary/ who answered, ' cer- 
tainly not.' 'One of the Benedictine 
fathers always attends the sick within 
fiv^^ miles of this, and performs the mar- 
ria.f^e ceremony when required/ He 
tht !i smiled, and casting an arch look on 
Alexena, observed, ' should you need a 
' worthy father, I can recommend one, 
' but he dare not marry any, except those 
' who choose to attend in the chapel 
' that stands a quarter of a mile from 
' this; it was once a splendid edifice, but 
' is now fast falling into decay, and both 
* the Benedictine fathers, and the inha- 
' bitants of the neighbouring town, are 
' too poor to keep it in repair; however, 
' this is of very little importance to you, 
' if you can prevail on the lady to ac- 
' company you to such a dismal old 
' place.' Lord Mortimer returned 
thanks to his kind host, and repeated 
what he had said to Miss Hastings, 
and begged she would use her influence 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 79 

with Alexena to perform her promise; 
pointing out the advantages that would 
ensue from their union. ' I will/ ob- 
served his lordship, ' have a les^al rinrht 
to protect her, and our marriage will 
be a check on the ungovernable 
Velasco, and prevent a renewal of 
Montano's late infamous attempts.* 
Miss Hastings assented to the neces- 
sity of their immediate union, and 
pressed it so much, that Alexena, find- 
ing it impossible to contend with her 
kind aunt, and impatient lover, con- 
sented, though not without consider- 
able reluctance. When his lordship 
had succeeded thus far, he instantly 
despatched Anselmo to the monastery, 
and ordered Rourke and Albert to 
accompany him to the chapel. Rourke 
could scarce restrain his joy within the 
bounds of moderation, on being as- 
sured Alexena was to be instantly 
united to his master, and Albert felt 
equally pleased at the event. These 
two faithful domestics had the horses 
ready in a few moments, and then the 



so alexena; or the 

former cut a caper, and brandishing an 
Irish black-thorn, shouted, ' Och ! to 
be sure I am'int the boy that would 
lick any ten Spaniards in the king^dom, I 
would soon make them dance in their 
brogues/ ' You be in very great glee 
Mr. Tom/ said Albert, ' take care you 
are not called on to keep your word 
very shortly/ Rourke laughed, and 
shaking Albert by the hand, promised 
to stick to him * like a skiver in a 
blanket,' if there ever should be occa- 
sion. 'I mean,' said Tom, "that I 
would willingly make powder of that 
fellows bones, who would wish to 
swinge a hair of your head.' ' Thank 
you ! thank you !' replied Albert, (as 
the tear of gratitude glistened in his 
eye,) I sincerely believe you would.' 
These friends then again shook hands, 
and led the horses to the door. 

In the mean time Anselmo returned 
with word, that father Zelo waited 
at the altar, and instantly lighted two 
torches that he had procured. In a

few minutes the anxious Mortimer and 
his bride elect, (who trembled vio- 
lently,) accompanied by Miss Hastings, 
and Anselmo, who was to have the 
honor of giving her away, proceeded 
to the chapel on horseback, attended 
by Rourke and Albert, who walked be- 
fore with the lights; and on entering 
it, found the worthy father alfeady 
there. He appeared to be upwards of 
sixty; corpulent, low in stature, and 
his hair silvered with age ; his habit was 
of coarse cloth, fastened to his waist 
by a leather girdle, from which hung 
his crucifix and beads; his countenance 
was mild and expressive, though care 
worn ; yet take him altogether, he was 
prepossessing, and Lord Mortimer felt 
pleased with his appearance. 

As to the chapel, Anselmo might 
well say it was a ruin ; the roof had 
given way in many places, and large 
decayed beams, that once supported the 
ceiling, lay prostrate on the benches, 
covered with the rubbish of which it had 

D 5 



SSt ALEXENA ; on THE 

been composed ; above, the owls had 
nestled in many places, and on seeing* 
the lii2:ht, terrified Alexena with their 
screams, as they glided with flapping 
■winofs throiio'h the lons^ dark aisles. 
Shafts of pillars lay scattered on the 
floor at uneven distances, and it was 
utterly impossible to discover the ex- 
tent ef this dismal sanctuary, by the 
languid flame of only two torches. 
However, the roof above the altar was 
entire, and the floor below unincum- 
bered by rubbish ; the neighbouring 
peasants having removed it, as this 
was the spot where their marriages 
were celebrated, and where the last 
awful rites were generally paid to the 
dead. 

Lord Mortimer led his Alexena to 
the altar, almost petrified by the gloom 
in wliich she was enveloped ; and 
Miss Hastings by her side, in much the 
same situation; even Rourke gazed 
wildly round, and heartily wished the 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. S3 

whole party at Anselmo's fire-side 
again. 

Father Zelo opened the book of 
holy writ, and began the ceremony; he 
handed the ring to Lord Mortimer, who 
took the beauteous and lily hand of 
Alexena, and was in the act of placing 
the dear pledge on her finger, when 
Rourke frantically exclaimed, ' blood- 
an-ounds! who are these?' His lordship 
turned hastily, and the same instant 
was wounded by Montano, who fired 
at him. The villain was accompanied 
by a troop of officers, habited in the 
robes of the inquisition, who loudly- 
called to Lord Mortimer and his at- 
tendants to surrender, as they rushed 
towards the altar to seize them. Zelo 
commanded them to hold, but his 
words were vain, and instantly a des- 
perate combat deluged the house of 
prayer with blood. Alexena, on ob- 
serving the cause of Rourke's alarm^, 
fainted, and when Montano fired, and 
Miss Hastings saw his lordship stag- 
ger, she fell senseless on the floor. In 



sir ALEXENA ; OR THE 

a moment, Albert, Rourke, and his dog 
Lion, drew up by his lordship's side, 
and with their back asrainst the wall, 
waited the attack of an host of enemies, 
determined to sell their lives as dearly 
as possible. Anselmo removed the 
senseless forms of the ladies within the 
pale of the altar, where the distracted 
Zelo endeavoured to assist them, and 
this was all the work of a moment. 
The inquisitorial officers were armed 
with cutlasses, but fortunately had no 
fire arms. Montano, it is true, had a 
case of pistols, but these were all — 
Lord Mortimer and Albert were armed 
with swords. Rourke had only his 
black-thorn cud^^el, and unfortunately 
Anselmo was without any weapon of 
defence. The inquisitors poured on 
his lordship's little band, but in a 
short time, many of them bade this 
world good night. Lord Mortimer, 
though wounded, was not disabled, 
and his soul's fury flashed lightning 
from his sparkling eyes, as he attacked 
the bloody, the treacherous Montano. 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. B5'' 

In a moment, down tumbled the villain, 
his lordship having laid his cheek 
open from the temple to the ear, and 
then assailed the next ; he endeavoured 
to keep the wall as much as possible,' 
to prevent the demons, by whom he 
was nigh overpowered, surrounding his 
worthy assistants, and encouraged them 
to keep together; his voice was as a 
trumpet, it steeled every neiTe, and 
breathed new vigour into their bosoms; 
death and blood accompanied every 
blow. Rourke, as the sounding strokes 
fell thick and heavy, shouted, that's my 
honey ! down with them, Albert ! och, 
that's my jewel ! make bruteene of their 
bones, cransh them, Lion ! guzzle them 
myboy, guzzle them; hilloo! you blood- 
hounds, death and damnation, what's 
this for? — Lion was not inattentive to 
his master's encouraging cries, for he 
had already torn two of the wounded 
inquisitors almost to pieces, though 
he had then four deep gashes in dif- 
ferent parts of his body. Six of these 
JBips* of darkness were already dead,

and both Roiuke and Albert wounded, 
the latter only slightly. His lordship 
was exhausted, and i;rew taint with ihe 
loss of blood, thou <;!i he yet kept the 
oilicers at ba^-. None dare attack him 
singly; his sword had pierced the hearts 
of tbur^ but victory was evidently on 
the side of the inquisitors^ and in a few 
moments the contest was at an end. 
INIontano, who had slowly recovered 
from a state of insensibility, now drevy 
from his bosom his second murderous 
engine, then raising liimself in a sitting 
posture, levelled it at Lord INIorlimer; 
twice he essayed to draw the trigger, 
but his strength refused to obey the 
impulse of his heart; he tried a third 
time, and was more sticcessfnl, his aim 
was sure, the fatal instrument exploded, 
and his lordship fell. His fall was ac- 
companied by a shout from the iv'i- 
nmpliant inquisitors, and a wild cry of 
horror from Rourke. Och! murder, 
my master, you're kilt ! but by my soul, 
while there is blood in my body, it shall 
be shed over your corpse : then snatch- 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 87 

ing his lordship's sabre, (with a foot 
on each side of him J at the first blow 
split the scull of the nearest foe. Dur- 
ing this time Father Zelo and Anselmo 
used every exertion to keep the ladies 
out of the reach of the inquisitors, who, 
poor souls, made the chapel ache with 
their heart-rending screams; but when 
Lord Mortimer fell, they both again 
relapsed into happy insensibiHty. — 
Rourke, supposing his master dead, 
now resolved to save Alexena, and as 
there was no time to be lost, he cauo'ht 
up her pale and beauteous figure from 
the cold floor, and at the same time ter- 
rified his foes, by his wild Irish cry, and 
the frantic manner in which he flourished 
his bloody sabre. Anselmo retired with 
Miss Hastings, while Albert covered his 
retreat, fighting desperately all the way 
down the aisle of the chapel. It was 
fortunate for them that there was only 
one torch to give light to this scene, 
(the other had been extinguished,) and 
this was fastened to the railing that 
wound round the altar. There was yet

strun^gles were violent, and she at leuijtli 
disengaged herself from the protecting 
arm of the almost tainting Rourke, 
and flew to seek her lo\-er amons: 
the dead and dying. ' Mortimer ! oh 
Mortimer !' she cried ; — he answered 
with a groan ; she heard it, saw him, 
and clasped him to her bosom. Her 
hair hung down loose and dischevelled, 
braided with the clotted blood of their 
enemies ; she pressed her lips to his cold 
aching- forehead, bathed his face with 
her tears, besought him to live for her, 
and tried to «top the etFusion of his 
blood with her thin white robes, 'till at 
length the sinewy arm of a merciless 
inquisitor forced her, wildly scream- 
ing, from his lordship's feeble grasp.

her, vail) ; fled, and >vith the assist- 
ance of Ansehno, pluced Miss Hastings 
on one of the horses, (which were con- 
cealed a little way from the chapel,) 
and escaped, while Lady Alexena and 
Lord INIortirner fell into the hands of 
those inhuman barbarians, who threw 
the almost lifeless body of the latter 
into a kind of litter, that had been pro- 
cured for the purpose, and in that me- 
lancholy condition conveyed him, co- 
vered with blood and wounds, to the 
subterraneous dungeons of the Domi- 
nican monastery.

** There are more things in heaven and earth— 
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy." 

Hamlet. 

On the arrival of Lord Mortimer at 
tlie Dominican monastery, a monk, who 
understood surgery, was sent to examine 
and dress his wounds. After he had 
probed and washed them, he gave a 



90 ALEXENA ; on THE 

favorable opinion : — the first ball that 
Montano fired having wounded his 
lordship slightly in the breast, the last 
lodged in his thigh, and this was con- 
ceived to be the most dangerous ; how- 
ever, the skilful father extracted it with 
the best success, and tlien had his 
patient removed from the dungeons to 
a cell off one of the galleries, where the 
air was better, and administered some 
light and nourishing refreshment fitting 
his exhausted condition. Tlie uncer- 
tainty he was in respecting Alexena's 
fate, and the pain of his wounds, forbade 
sleep to visit his weary ej^es, and tossed 
his thoughts in a sea of agony. Ber- 
nardo, the monk, came frequently to 
see him in the course of the nis^ht, and 
the moment he entered, his lordship 
was sure to assail him with a volume 
of questions ; but ^to one of which the 
cautious father refused to reply, till 
Lord Mortimer produced a heavy purse 
of that yellow shining metal, which not 
only opens the prison door, but often 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 91 

discloses the secret workings of the 
hearf. This he promised^ if he would 
inform him what had been done with 
the lady who fell into the hands of 
the officers in the chapel. It had the 
desired effect^ the monk looked wist- 
fully at the gold, then started, softly 
unlocked the door, and looked into 
the long deserted gallery, returned 
aji^ain, and drew from his bosom a smalt 
brass crucifix. Then, in an agitated 
voice, said, ' give me the gold, and 
' swear to be as secret as the grave, 
' never to disclose what I shall unfold/ 
His lordship said, ' I swear,' and then 
kissed the crucifix. Bernado was satis- 
fied, and informed his lordship of many 
interesting particulars, among which 
he gave a description of the convent 
and monastery, and a sketch of Mon- 
tano's character. He has given, con- 
tinued Bernardo, a voluminous descrip- 
tion of his journey to England, in which 
he expresses the most implacable hatred 
to the whole nation, but particularly to 
your lordship, who he represents as a 



92 ALEXENA ; OR THE 

worthless heretical libertine; and states, 
he more than once caught you in the 
commission of acts as infamous as they 
were mean ; for instance, listening to 
the idle fabrications of a servant, named 
Gonzales, who frequently displayed his 
mischievous disposition in exciting your 
disgust against Lady Alexena's brother, 
for the purpose of retarding her return 
to Spain. That domestic, before his 
death, sent for your lordship, for the 
purpose of disclosing some important 
secrets of the Velasco family, but 
luckily was prevented by Montano, who 
burst into the room, and warmly up- 
braided you on the occasion; on which, 
loosing all regard for his sacred func- 
tion, you impiously raised your hand 
against his person, and used such 
menaces, as rendered it unsafe for him 
to remain under the same roof Being 
thus persecuted, he applied to the queen 
for redress, and that most pious princess, 
instantly sent officers for the purpose ; 
but they, unknown to her, were your 
lordship's friends, and had the cruelty 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 93 

to appoint you commander of the vessel 
which conveyed him to this country. 
On landing, being apprehensive his 
personal safety was in danger, he with- 
drew the first opportunity, and hastened 
to Madrid, where he made Don Velasco 
acquainted with bis voyage, and with 
your character, and besought him to 
save his sister from the grasp of such a 
wretch as he has represented you to be. 
Velasco accordingly applied to the holy 
tribunal; yet, notwithstanding their 
vigilance, you, with the assistance of 
spiesj had intelligence of their proceed- 
ings, and avoided punishment by flight; 
but he now rests assured you will meet 
the just recompense of your crimes and 
blind presumption. 

' Is not this very plausible?' observed 
Bernardo, ' though few here believe it; 

' Montano is known too well for many 
' to place confidence in his narrative, 
' particularly where his interest is so 
* deeply interwoven, as is the case in 
' the present instance. You must

' know he looks forward to the hope 
' of being elected treasurer to this in- 
' stitution very shortly, and is at present 
^ a great favorite with the lady abbess 
' of the adjoining convent, whose power 
' is far from despicable. Influenced by 

* those circumstances, he left no means 
' untried to gratify her insatiable ava- 
' rice; and the fortune of Al^xeua, 
' which he has prevailed on her brother 
' to endow her cloister with, on con- 

* dition that his sister is immediately 
' compelled to take the veil, has in- 
'sured her confidence. Don Velasco 
' has condemned the Lady Alexena to 
' perpetual solitude within the con- 
' vent walls ; a few hours ago, with 
' Montano's assistance, the infamous 
' compact was concluded, which, if I 
' mistake not, irretrievably ruins the 
'^ peace of mind of you both. She being

' ordered to attend her for a few mo- 
' ments, and, by my beads, she is the 
' prettiest novice I have seen within 
' these walls those many years.' Here 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 95 

the tears trembled in Bernardo's eyes, 
and clearly proved he was deeply inter- 
ested^ at the same time promising to ren- 
der him every assistance: ' I have taken 
your gold/ he said, but it shall be 
devoted to your service, and, I trust, it 
will unbar the gates of this prison for 
us all, if not, it may facilitate our es- 
cape by other means; for, believe me, 
I am detained here against my incli- 
nation, as well as you, and am not a 
professed monk, but merely surgeon 
to the institution. But no more of this, 
I have already staid too long, and cer- 
tainly have been rather indiscreetly 
communicative to a stranger, of 
whom the good father Montano has 
spoken with such severity. However, 
in this instance, I hope I risk little, 
and 1 wish your lordship a very good 
night ; to-morrow, I trust, will bring 
some tidings of the Lady Alexena, 
which will revive your languishing 
hopes.' Lord Mortimer shook his 
new friend's hand, and with many 



96 alexena; or the 

thanks for his kindness, let him depart, 
but not without first extorting' his pro- 
mise, that he would see Alexena early 
the following morning, and cotwince her 
of his existence, and the favorable stale 
of his wounds. 

Shortly after the death of Don 
Velasco, his son plunged into the 
most shameful excesses, and gave vent 
to those passions which had been 
restrained during his father's life. 
Montano became acquainted with him 
at an early period, and speedily formed 
an accurate judgment of his temper 
and disposition; the conclusion was 
favorable to his views, and he was 
determined to court the protection of 
the young' Velasco, who was eventually 
to enjoy the power and fortune of his 
family, while the delicate state of his 
father's health, promised him the im- 
mediate enjoyment of it. Influenced by 
those circumstances, Montano privately 
ministered to the passions of the heir, 
and winked at the evil propensities 



CASTJ.E OF SANTA MAHCO. g7 

which were too prominent in his ♦^-ene- 
ral character to escape ohservatioii. 
Velasco soon becanne attaclied to the 
monk, and made him many promises 
of future lavor, which he punctually 
performed, the moment he had the 
means. His bounty and larg-esses served 
to excite the avarice of his confessor, 
who embraced with avidity every pro- 
ject that promised a golden reconT- 
pense. The excesses of his pupil 
knew no bounds, and, consequently, in 
a short time, he became greatly embar- 
rassed in his pecuniary affairs, and 
applied to Montano for advice and 
assistance. The latter, thouo-h unwil- 
ling to part with his money, made 
amends by proposing ingenious ways 
and means; one of which was, t!iat 
he should seize the fortune of his 
sister, then about thirty thousand dol- 
lars, as she could not possibly havfT 
occasion for so larire a sum, and then 
place her in a convent, agreeable to 
her father's original intention. Velasco 
at first felt reluclant to enter into liiis 

VOL. I. E 



9S ALEXEXA; or XilE 

barbarous measure, but when his ne- 
cessities became more pressing, he 
yielded, and as few obstacles opposed 
this plan, he resolved to carry it into 
immediateexecution. One ditficulfv ob- 
truded, which was, that Alexena resided 
in England w ith her aunt, who might 
refuse to allow her to return, as she was 
one of the guardians appointed by her 
father's will; but Montano instantly 
offered to obviate this difficulty, by ob- 
taining, under feigned pretences, an 
order from the Inquisition to the queen of 
Great Britain, commanding her lO send 
their victim under his protection, to her 
friends in Spain ; as to the rest, it 
would be easy to engage a vessel 
for the purpose, and it was mutually 
agreed, that if Alexena died in the in- 
terim, or on the passage, the monk was 
to have two thousand crowns, in addition 
to the sum he had stipulated for, as 
compensation for his private services. 

When this horrid contract was finally 
concluded, Montano made instant pre- 
l)aratiouSj and easily obtained the order 



CASTLE OF SAXTA MARCO. S9 

from the holy tribunal ; every thing pro- 
mised the speedy completion of their vil- 
lainy, until Gonzales intruded. He was 
an old and faithful domestic, who had 
spent a long life in the service of his late 
lord^ and had, from Montano's introduc- 
tion to the family, conceived an unac- 
countable aversion for him, and by ob- 
serving his deportment with a watchful 
eye, saw enough to increase his dislike 
a'nd suspicions. The monk, however, 
acted with great caution^ during the life 
of the late Don Velasco, and did not 
throw off the mask until a few months 
after his death; but then his character, 
which had hitherto been concealed 
under the veil of hypocrisy and dissi- 
mulation, gradually burst through the 
flimsy covering, and disclosed the 
villainy that had so long lurked be- 
neath it. Gonzales overheard a few 
words relative to the intended voyage, 
which gave him an indistinct idea of 
what was intended, and he instantly 
resolved to ascertain the facts, no 
matter how. Urged by his fears for 



100 ALEXENA; OR TfIC 

Alexena's safety, the next time the 
monk was admitted to a private con- 
ference with his young master, he ap- 
plied his ear to the key-hole, and by 
this means, however reprehensible, 
obtained a perfect conviction of their 
intentions, and resolved to defeat (hem, 
even should his life be the sacrifice. 
Thus influenced, he intreated liberty 
to accompany Montano to Enj;land, 
but was absolutely refused, as it was 
evident he would be a restraint on his 
intentions, and might defeat them alto- 
gether. Gonzales, however, became 
more urgent, and as both Velasco and 
the motdc feared his penetration, and 
knew the implacability of his hatred, if 
once excited, they consented to grant 
his request, but had predetermined to 
throw him overboard, the monjeut tliey 
jliould descry the British coast. 

In a few days after, Montano sailed, 
attended l)y this servant, and a band of 
bravo's, who, the former, had engaged 
for the purpose of consigning Alexena 



TATSTLE OF SANTA MARCO. lOl 

to a watery grave ; but Providence had 
ordained they should never reach the 
land, as the storm buried them in tlie 
deep. And those were the circum- 
stances that Gorizales wished to com- 
municate the night he expired m 
Hollywood-Castle. 

On Montano's return to Spain, he 
traced his way back to Madrid witli 
all possible expedifiorj, and sought 
Velasco, to whom he gave a particular 
detail of his voyage. The latter was en- 
raged almost to frenzy at the result, as 
he had disposed of part of Alexena's for- 
tune, and impatiently exclaimed, 'what 
shall I do, if she now claims it? my 
reputation, already on the decline, 
will be irretrievably ruined!' The 
monk, without hesitation, told him the 
plan he had formed, by which Lord 
Mortimer could not possibly escape 
destruction ; and if he, who was tho 
chief obstacle, was once removed, they 
then could dispose of Alexena and 
leer fortune, without further mipedi-

ment. Velasco readilv subscribed io 
his lordship's annihilation, when he 
found that he actually loved his sister, 
and was beloved by her; but when 
the monk informed him that Gonzales 
had overheard their intentions, and 
disclosed them, together with an ac- 
count of the scene in that domestic's 
chamber, previous to his death, his 
rage became almost insupportable, and 
he demanded, with convulsive eager- 
.ness, couM Montano have a moment's 
hesitation in stabbing him to the Jieart, 
if opportunity offered. Montano, at 
this moment, sat close to a table, on 
which a solitary lamp feebly gleamed, 
and cast a dim light on the large apart- 
ment in which they sat ; while Velasco 
had drawn his chair nigh the few expiring 
embers on the hearth, over which he 
leaned, muttering curses on his sister's 
lover, as he peevishly waited the monk's 
reply. It came not for a few moments, 
-and Velasco raised his eyes to those 
of his confessor, to inquire the cause,

disappointment, and blazed with re-

paused, and gasped for breath, while 
Velasco's broad grin, proved the satis- 
taction he felt at the monk's depravity, 
and instantly pointed out Scalto, as a 
person fit and willing to commit the 
deed. The latter, after some hesita- 
tion, assented, yet continued to lament 
the necessity that indjjced him to let 
Lord Mortimer shake off this frail 
incumbrance of martal dust so easily; 
but before they parted for the night, 
Montano promised, if Velasco would 
supply a sufficient sum, he would un- 
dertake the entire arrangement of this 
business, to which the former gladly 
assented, and paid the money tlic fol-

direction, reached it six hours before 
the arrival of his lordship on the com-

which slie became interested for their 
success. The latter having agreed to 
make her a present of a thousand 
crowns, if she woidd suspense with,

promised to take every precaution to

ten thousand dollars as her portion; 
'ivliich, thouo^h not more than one third 
of her fortune, was considered very li-

wounds, and the remaining eighteen

questions, which succeeded each other 
with amazing rapidity. * Please speak

to plod over the means of escape, at all 
times ilifTicnIt from the situalion of the 
monastery, which stood in a friglitfnl 
vale between two mountains, surround- 
ed almost on every side with inacces- 
sible rocks. The road wound auioni*- 
the precipices, above which, tufts of 
trees were scattered at small distances, 
and seemed to hang on the ledge of 
these romantic crairs, vainly endeavour- 
ing to kiss the tops of the tall pines in 
the chasms below. The landscape in 
the immediate vicinity of those sanc- 
tuaries was a\N fully grand, and few be- 
held it without shrinking at the idea, 
that it misrht be their fate to linsrer 
within those prisons which frowned in 
its bosom; and there Lord Mortimer 
lay planning a thousand methods of 
escape, not one of which he ever had 
it in his power to make trial of. 

About a fortni<>ht after his arrival, Ber-' 
nardo was sent to say, the superior would 
•ee him next night in the hall appropri- 
ated for the trial of the monks, and where 
he was accordingly conducted at the 
-iippointed hour, dressed iu the English

costume; very few moments were al- 
lowed him for reflection before tlie 
folding doors (lew open, and a number 
of monks entered, bearing torches; they 
resembled a group of Pandemonian 
ghosts, who were unusually pale and 
ghastly, from the length of time they 
had wandered on the shores of Styx, 
before Charon had compassion to 
ferry them over. Their prior was old 
and feeble ; his person tall, but very 
much stooped ; his face yellow and full 
of wrinkles; his eyes dim and deep, 
sunk in his head ; they had lost the fire 
of youth, if they ever had any, and al- 
together he looked like an half de- 
4:'ayed corpse animated. A number of 
attendants, dressed in fantastic habits, 
waited on this spectre, and assisted him 
to his chair, (which was raised a few 
feet from the level of the floor,) and a 
few minutes after, he thus addressed 
Lord Mortimer: — ' Say, young and 
' thoughtless stranger, what evil genius 
' tempted you to commit those crimes, 
'in the very perpetration of which, yott 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. Ml

' have you not in the short space ot" a

* our laws, in spiriting away a virgin, 
' holy dedicated to her God ? of most 
^ foul murder ou the persons of many 
' of our sacred officers? blasphemy 
' against our church, and rebellion 
' against every decree of heaven ? Each 

* of those vile offences is punishable 
■^ with death — a death of lingering tor- 
' ments. What compensation can you 
' offer 1 What atonement can you make? 

* Who have been your assistants, and 
'what were their motives? To this last 
' question, I intreat a true and satis- 

* factory answer ; make ample confes- 

* sion, 'tis the only thing that can now 

* save you from everlasting misery, for 

* your enormities are of too deep a 

* shade to allow me to flatter you with 
' the most distant hope of pardon in 
^ this world ; therefore, I beg you will 
' jnake good use of the short tune that

' prepare for that awful eternity into 
' which you are so shortly to be launch- 
*ed, to meet an offended Deity, and, if 
^possible, appease his wrath by timely 
'repentance.' 

His lordship now intreated to be 
heard, and said, although he was aware 
he \'^as not then on trial, yet, he trusted, 
if the prior would have the patience to 
hear him, he could, in some measure, 
remove the prejudice that it was evi- 
dent existed in the minds of all those 
who had heard any thing of the recent 
transactions, 'In the first place.' conti- 
nued Lord Mortimer, ' I deny that I 
'have committed blasphemy; aiid as to 
' the other crimes of which I am accused, 
' I thus reply : — I saw Lady Alexena at 
' the house of a triend of mine in Eng-

' acquaintance, I became her professed 
* admirer, and in a little time, being as-

by her acceptance. A nnoiik was now 
sent to conduct her to a brother's 
armSj and I accompanied her; that 
brother proved unworthy of the ^reat 
trust of a protector, and 1 pressed the 
speedy celebration of our union, that 
1 miirht be entitled to that enviable 
name. She consented : I led her to the 
altar, innocent and unconscious of 
offence, when tliat inhuman monster, 
one of the brother's of your order, 
Montano ! dashed the cup of joy un- 
tasted from my lips, and endeavoured 
to deprive me of existence. The 
worm on which you thread will turn ; 
then why expect I should tamely sub- 
mit to be butchered. What I have 
done was in the defence, and for the 
preservation of my life, and in the 
hope of saving the innocent Alexena 
from the merciless gra?p of her in- 
human brother and his vile associ- 
ate: I fono-ht while I had strenijth, 
and fell when exhausted . Men arc

' ries, I had none, my faithful servants 
' were my only assistants, and 1 regret 
' they were wounded in the defence of 
' a man, who, from the import of your 
^ words, never will have the power to 
' reward the fidelity and courage they 
' so nobly displayed in the hour of 
' danger. If there has been guilt, I 
' alone am guilty ; therefore, on me let 
' the punishment be inflicted, and I 
' trust I shall meet the vengeance which 
' you say awaits me, with the fortitude 
' of a man unconscious of crime.' 

*' I dare do all that may become a man ; 
Who dare* do more, is none.*' 

Here his lordship bowed, and thft 
prior appeared interested ; his words 
carried conviction to the heart of the 
father, who acknowledi]:ed this to him-

self, and as he rose to withdraw, said, 
' he would carefully consider his lord- 
ship's case, and if it proved correct, 
would interest himself in his behalf.' 
Lord Mortimer returned him thanks, 
and the prior then retired with his at- 
tendants. His lordship had his doubts 
as to the result, and resolved to effect 
his escape, and carry oft" Alexena, 
though she were professed, as he felt 
assured ijothing but force could com- 
pel her to take the veil. 

It was now four months since he 
became a prisoner, and nothing de- 
cisive had yet been done ; Alexena's 
noviciate drew near a conclusion, and 
the preparations were already talked 
of, preparatory to the solemn vow. 
Bernardo had only been able to con- 
vey a few billets to and from the lo- 
vers, and even this was attended with 
considerable danger; but it now be- 
came absolutely necessary that some- 
thing should be attempted to prevent 
the complete frustration of their hopes.

Therefore, the next night, when Ber- 
nardo came to indulge his lordship vviJh 
his evening's walk on the terrace, he 
pointed out the urgency there was for 
some bold effort; to this the other 
readily assented, and informed him the 
fears and suspicions of the abbess were 
lulled by Alexena's ready compliance 
with the fust forms; she having attend- 
ed to his instructions in every thing, 
and if they could but obtain assistance- 
from without, he had no hesitation in 
saying, their escape would be easily 
effected. Here he was interrupted by- 
two njcn, who had clambered (o the 
summit of a rock, which was almost on 
i\ level with the terrace, though a con- 
siderable distance frouj it. Bernardo 
retired into the shade, and desired his 
lordship to address them in English; 
he did so, and judge his emotion on 
being instantly known and answered 
by Rourke, who Albert, with ditiicully, 
prevented from bawling, lest he shoidd 
discover and ruin all. Lord Mortimer, 
after expressing his joy, begged they

would speak in a suppressed tone, as 
every word echoed among the rocks. — 
' Oh ! God save you, my lord ! speak 
again, 1 hope you're alive, but I doubt 
it/ exclaimed Tom. 'Oh! my deer 
master, say you're alive, or I'll loose my 
seven senses! arrah, thunder-an-ounds 
Albert, man, is there no way to be after 
getting him out of this murder'n hole.' 
' For, heaven's sake, Rourke, be silent/ 
replied his lordship, ' or you may cause 
my instant destruction.' ' I will ! I 
v\ill, my heart's blood, but how can we 
sarve you.' Albert then said, 'my lord, 
' since Providence has discovered you, 

* I will, with your permission, come to- 
' morrow night, at this hour, with a let- 
' tor, in which I will communicate what 

* has happened since I saw you last, 
' and you can lower a string lo which 
' I can fasten it, and receive your in- 

* sfructions by the same conveyance. 
' Miss Hastings is well, and at present

' sary we should now retire^ for it will 
' be day-light before we reach our re- 
' Ireat a^aiu.' He and Rourke then 
pulled off their hats, and his lordship 
wished them good night. 'May all 
the holy angels protect you/ said 
Albert. ' Amen ! Amen !* ejaculated 
Rourke, ' and now that you're found, 
with God's help, you shan't be long 
in that purgatory.* 

The moment those faithful fellows 
were out of sight, Bernardo embraced 
his lordship, saying, 'all's well, we 
' only want the lady Alexena, and a 
' few trusty fellows to keep off the 
' banditti that infest this accursed 
' neighbourhood, as T have the means 
' of escape already within my power ; 
' let us now retire to your cell, where 
' I will furnish you with pen, ink, and 
'^ paper, together with a cord to lower 
' the letter.' His lordship then wrote 
to Albert, to have the horses and ser- 
vants at the foot of the great bridge, 
within a gun-shot of the building, at 



©A3TLE OF SANTA MARCO. 119 

twelve o'clock on the fourth ni^ht from 
the date of his letter, and to he care- 
ful to have all his English attendants 
M^ell armed and mounted, witli relays 
of horses fifty miles on the road to 
Valladolid ; and to adopt every other 
precaution that his prudence should 
dictate, which would be likely to en- 
sure their escape and safety. He im- 
patiently waited the approach of the 
next night, and at the appointed hour 
hurried to the terrace to ni^et Albert, 
who was close under the walls, while 
Rourke watched at a distance ; his 
lordship instantly lowered liis letter, 
and drew up that of his servant. Al- 
bert contrived to read his by the light 
of a small lamp he had concealed 
under his cloak, and then promised to 
have every thing ready at tlje time 
nwd place appointed, and shorHy after 
retired most hapjiy in the hopes of 
delivcriuii" his master. 

Bernardo now communicated his 
plan, which promised success. Lord

who acted as aa assistant to the foi- 
iner, and to follow him, disguised, into 
the subterraneous dungeons, as out of 
them only they could entertain a hope 
of escape. The vigilance of the abbess 
was to-^be eluded by the confusion that 
was likely to ensue in consequence of 
the execution of a lovely female, who, 
by the excellence of her wit, contrived 
to deceive the porters at the grate, 
and effect her liberation the night of 
the day before the one on which she 
should be compelled to take the veil ; 
but having only her courage and 
strength to carry her from this dreaded 
placCj unfortunately missed her \^a3',

our otficers, who inhumanly delivered 
her into the hands of her tormen- 
tors: she was tried, found guilty, 
and by the laws of the institution, 
condemned to be buried alive, but 
through the intercession of the prior, 
her sentence was mitigated into dying 
on the wheel. She is^ continued Ber-

uardo, merely to be fastened to the 
machine, and die by a blow, not to 
suffer all the tortures of that dreaded 
instrument. The abbess must be in- 
duced to compel Alexena to witness 
this execution, as by that means only, 
we can effect her deliverance, and I 
will write to the lady mother, stating-, 
that from what I have seen, it is my 
firm belief, her apparent compliance 
"with the will of her brother, is mere 
hypocrisy, and if I might so far pre- 
sume, 1 would advise she should be 
a spectator of Ellena's punishment, 
as an effectual preventive against 
similar attempts on her part. Lord 
Mortimer agreed to the necessity of 
the measure, though not without con- 
sideral)le hesitation, and Bernardo re- 
tired, for the purpose of making the 
attempt, and had the good fortune to 
succeed, even beyond his expectations ; 
having seen Alexena, and coivinced 
her of the urgency that induced him 
to adopt such disagreeable proceed- 
ings, and desired her to express re«»

luctance to a monastic life before those 
nuns that were most likely to convey 
her sentiments to the ears of the ab- 
bess. While he was thus engaged, 
his lordship writhed under the most 
cruel apprehensions^ Jest something 
unforeseen should occur to defeat their 
intentions, or retard their deliverance ; 
at the same time, he felt the deepest 
regret, that the hourwhich was to restore 
liberty and Alexena, would be the last of 
the hapless Ellena's existence. ' Oh ! 
accursed, diabolical cruelty,' he men- 
tally exclaimed, ' you reign triumphant 
in those liabitations that should be the 
mansions of peace and tranquillity.* 
He sickened at the idea of the ap- 
proaching scene, and retired to his 
hard couch, oppressed with melancholy 
reflections.

■M HE dreaded nii^Iit arrived, on which 
the unfortunate Ellena was to ipay the 
forfeit of her crime; half past eleven 
o'clock was the hour in which the me- 
lancholy spectators were to assemble, 
previous to her execution. Lord 
Mortimer sat musing in his solitary 
cell, when the dull sound of the 
convent bell announced the approach- 
ing death of the loveliest of mor- 
tals ; his blood chilled in his veins, 
and he started with a look of horror ; 
again, the slow and solemn note siole 
upon his ear, but ere it came a third 
time, Bernardo entered to conduct him 
to the gallery of the chapel, where he 
might offer up his prayers for a de- 
parting sister, without fear of being 
recognised by Aiexena, and was re- 

f2 



124 ALEXENA; on THB 

luctantly obliged to use a monkish habit 
for that purpose; his guide then led the 
way, and was followed bj his lordship. 

The house of prayer was lighted by 
a number of torches placed round the 
altar, but which served to cast a me- 
lancholy gleam over the columns in the 
back ground, and gave a most awful 
impression to the succeeding scene. 
The mournful peal of the organ pro- 
claimed the approach of the hapless 
victim, and when his lordship beheld 
her, the tears of pity and compassion 
trinkled down his cheek. 

In front of the procession were foiir 
old nuns bearing torches; next, the 
prior of the Dominicans and the lady 
abbess; then two monks, between 
ivhom the lovely Ellena ; after her. 
four other monks with torches ; next 
followed Alexena and several other 
novices, and last of all the executioner, 
who bore in his hand the instrument of 
tleath. The nuns were already in thcK*

proper place in the chapel, and this 
melancholy cavalcade now became mo- 
tionless before its altar. There EUena — 
the unfortunate, ill-fated Ellena — was 
led to hear the abbess proclaim the na- 
ture of her crime, and mode of punish- 
ment; and as she had not been pro- 
fessed, the prior gave her absolution, 
and the abbess her maternal blessinir. 
Oh ! had jou seen her at that moment, 
how meek, how resigned, she knelt on 
one knee, as she turned her soft blue 
eyes towards heaven. The scalding 
tears chased each other down her pale, 
but beauteous cheeks ; her fine hair 
hung in careless ringlets on her shoul- 
ders and snowy bosom ; her lovely form, 
sjiaped with the most elegant symmetry, 
was arrayed in a loose white robe ; 
and the heart of the noble Mortimer, 
as he gazed, bled at the idea of the 
sacrifice that was about to be oflfered 
on the altar of cruelty ; the impressive 
sound of the organ roused his atten- 
tion, and he waited in trembling, hope- 
less anxiety, for the conclusion of a 



156 ALEXENA ; OR THE 

scene, the most heart-rending that can 
be imagined. 

They now proceeded to the execution 
chamber, through innumerable wind- 
ings, turnings, and dreary passages; 
the floors of which were covered with 
saw-dust, while clammy sweats covered 
the cold damp walls ; they moved along 
in profound silence ; nought was to be 
heard, save the sobs of the noviciates, 
and the clinking of the friars' beads ; 
at length, they reached the execution 
chamber; it was a cold, gloomy dun- 
geon, in which stood wheels, racks, 
gibbets, and several other instruments 
of torture : this charnel house was very 
extensive; in the walls were various 
nitches, some built up, which contained 
the remains of luckless nuns, who liad 
long before been entombed alive for 
similar offences, for which even then 
EUena was about to suffer; others stood 
open with ponderous jaws, and gaped 
for prey, while tools for building, stone^ 
and lime, lay scattered on the floor. 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. ]27 

I The wretched maiden was led into 

the further extremity of tliis vault of 
terror^ and delivered into the hands of 
the executioner, by a monk who always 
attends for the purpose ; she at that 
dreaded moment^, did not either shriek 
or groan, but submitted silently to 
her hard fate. The executioner led 
her to the scaffold, which was covered 
with black, on which was placed the 
wheel ; he seized his victim, and bound 
her on it, then took off her veil, and 
covered her eyes with a black handkerr 
chief; she then threw back her hair which 
hung in ringlets on her neck, p^nd wait- 
ed the fatal signal. The same monk 
now advanced, and laid his hand on his 
heart ; it was a sign to give her the coup 
de grace — to despatch hei in a moment ; 
the executioner understood him, and 
the wheel remained motionless ; but he 

fW^' raised his briiiht stilleto. and turnina: 
his back to the terrified spectators, 
aimed at her heart. The daa^orer 
was sure, and found a shelter in the 
loveliest bosom that ever srraced a 



158 ALEXENA ; OR TUB 

human form. A piercing shriek an- 
nounced the dead) blow, it was but 
one, she never gave another ; her con- 
vulsed and quivering lip shewed the 
quick approach of death ; a cold dew 
trembled on her forehead ; she sobbed 
violently; then slightly struggling, with- 
out a groan, yielded her bright spirit 
into the bosom of her Redeemer. 

Thus perished Ellena ! Thus had 
these inhuman monsters, under the 
mask of religion, deprived the lovely 
Ellena of life, for being guilty only of 
attempting to elude persecution. 

When the principal witness of the 
recent tragedy observed, that the spi- 
rit of Ellena had fled to Paradise, to 
enjoy eternal bliss, the abbess ordered 
a requiem to be chaunted for the re- 
pose of the soul of the departed ; and as 
the deep and melancholy notes of the 
organ, swung with a softened cadence 
along those damp, chilling passages. 
Lord Mortimer observed Alexena stand- 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 129 

mg in the centre of the vault, almost 
paralysed with horror, apparently in- 
sensible to the terror-striking' objects 
around her^ until the hoarse, pestilen- 
tial, and heart-appalin^ voice of the 
abl)ess roused her to a dreadful sense of 
her situation. ' Follow me/ said this 
retailer of exquisite torments ; ' follow 
* me to the receptacle prepared for 
' meditation and repentance, and there 
' reflect on what you have seen : re- 
' member this is the slightest punish- 
' ment inflicted on the crimes of con- 
' tumely and disobedience.' 

The abbess then ordered her to be 
conducted to a cell next the dungeon, 
where, but a few minutes before, she 
beheld the hapless EUena expire ; and 
while the massy door grated on its 
rusty hinges, as it opened to receive her, 
she shuddered at the idea, that the pe- 
riod might not be far distant, when she 
should perish by the same fatal pun- 
ishment, or even worse. The moment 
the ponderous bolt bounded into its 

F 5 



J30 ALEXEXA; OR THB 

lustj^ fastenings, and had enclosed th« 
delicate form of Alexena in its cold 
and vanity bosonfi, the abbess delivered 
the key to Bernardo, and the same 
moment Lord Mortimer was conducted 
by two familiars to his cell. 

When his lordship again found him- 
self in solitude, he drew forth the let- 
ter of his faithful Albert, which till 
then lay unread and neglected ; and as. 
his eye passed over the well known 
characters, he found that his faithful 
and attached servant <:onceived he 
had been killed by the officers of the 
Inquisition, on that eventful night in 
which he had fallen, bravely defending 
his Alexena. On this supposition, he 
had hastened with all possible despatch 
to the hovel on the common, and in less 
than ten minutes left it at full speed, 
accompanied by Miss Hastings and 
all the servants, expecting every mo- 
ment to be pursued, overtaken, and 
Irv'^atcd fijost barbaroiisly by the monks. 



CASTLE OP Santa marco. 151 

He therefore did not continue in the 
direct road, but chose an unfrequented 
way that led to a place of safety, where 
he arrived at day break, and there kept 
the entire of his lord's suite, Rourke 
and he having resolved to perish 
rather than leave the country until 
they should obtain positive confirma- 
tion of his death or safety. To obtain 
information that miorht be relied on 
was difficult, but the host on the com- 
mon, who lived in the neighbourhood 
of the convent, contrived to let him 
know, that his lord had been conveyed 
to the Dominican monastery, where he 
still survived, and was in a fair way of 
recovery. Rourke, therefore, regularly 
every night, took his station on the 
point of the horrible rocks that over- 
look those ever to bo dreaded and 
terrific mansions, with the fond hope 
of seeing his master; for it n3ver oc- 
curred to his imagination, that he was 
strictly confined ; on the contrary, he 
conceived Lord Mortimer had liberty 
io wander through the buildings, as 



132 ALEXENA ; OR THE 

often as he felt an inclination^ and, 
bnoyed up with those hopes, continued 
his nightly watch, until he and Albert 
"were so fortunate as to find him 
on the termce. The moment Lord 
Mortimer had read the last sentence, 
lie consumed the letter with the assist- 
ance of his lamp, and was watching 
the last expiring sparks produced by 
its ashes^ when Bernardo ,entered. He 
apologized for the delay, by observing, 
it was his duty to see the remains of 
EUena prepared for interment, and then 
produced a gown and a dagger. ' My 
assistant is secured,' said he, ' disguise 
' yourself in this dress, and follow me 
' with these select perfumes to the 
' chamber in which the cold and 
' breathless form of EUena lies.' His 
lordship joyfully obeyed ; but first cau- 
tiously muffled himself in the monk's 
habit, then locked the door of his 
prison, and walked after the kind 
BernardOj in profound silence.

passed them, and in a few moments 
arrived at the prison of Alexena — a 
treasury, which contained a jewel of 
inestimable value! When Bernardo

was about to enter it. Lord Mortimer 
pointed to a light that faintly glim- 
mered in the distant extremity of the 
vanity passage, his guide motioned 
silence, and at the same moment libe- 
rated his fair prisoner, then forbidding 
all expressions of congratulation until 
a more fit season, moved rapidly for- 
vyard towards that liijht which had 
caused Lord Mortimer^s observation; 
as they advanced it increased ; and, at 
length, they discovered a narrow pas- 
sage, apparently cut in the wall, the 
entrance of which was strongly secured 
by a gate composed of iron bars ; on 
the inside stood a table covered with 
wine, and other refreshments of the 
most savory and delicious description, 
and this curious banqueting-chambei* 
was well lighted with torches. At the 
farther end there was another gate, in 
every respect the same as the former, 
through which hands were extended 
-endeavouring to obtain the food before 
them, but could not, though it wa^S 
within a few inelics of their fingers;

iherc were two in this earthly tantalus, 
and it is unnecessary to say they ex- 
cited the most lively pity. Bernardo 
explained the nature of their crime, and 
of their punishment, by stating, ' that 
' they had been sentenced to be starved 
' to death ; and I wonder they yet 

* live, as this is the fourth day of their 
' confinement. Those provisions which 
' you se6, were intended, by their deli- 
' cious sraell, to increase their appetite, 

'■' and make their punishment still more 
' horrible ; but the hour of their deliver* 
' ance has arrived, if it is not yet too 

* late, for I will this moment release 
' them.' He then unlocked the out- 
tvard gate; and the instant those lovely- 
unfortunates saw him, they begged a 
mouthful of bread, for the Holy Virgin's 
sake. ' Be pacified,' said Bernardo, 
' and you shall have enough, for I 
' came for the purpose of rescuing 

* you from this miserable dungeon.* 
At first they conceived he mocked them, 
but when Lord Mortimer assured them 



136 ALEXEHA ; OR THE 

of his kind intentions, the eldest of 
the two exclaimed^ 'Oh! Mortimer!' 
and fell fainting against the railing; 
she was instantly recognized by his 
lordship, as that Evelene whom he 
met before the tribunal at Madrid. 
When Bernardo had extorted a pro- 
mise from each, that thev would not 
taste ought but what he should allow^ 
least it might prove fatal, he unbarred 
the gate of their den, which was a 
dark narrow cell, covered wifh the 
mouldering bones of human bodies, 
without either bed, or any kind of 
furniture. Hunger had so far pre- 
vailed over these hapless females, that 
the youngest of the two twisted a 
thigh bone from a skeleton, and pulled 
down from the table a piece of venison, 
which they drew to them with the 
same implement, and greedily devour- 
ed; but on making a second attempt, 
the bone, rotten and decayed, had 
broken, and they had neither strength 
nor resolution to try the same expedient. 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 137 

Bernardo, on releasing them, gave 
tliem a small portion of food, and after 
they were somewhat relieved, they all 
hastened towards that door that pro- 
mised to release them from this scene 
of honor. Necessity obliged them 
to pass through Ellena's funeral cham- 
ber; and as they entered, the most 
awful sensations chilled their hearts. 
The walls and floor were covered with 
black; seven white wax tapers burned 
on a table close to the bed, the furni- 
ture of which was black, ornamented 
with white ribbon, underneath its ca- 
nopy lay the cold form of Ellena; a pall 
covered her remains, now arrayed in 
sepulchral robes. When the ladies 
reached her couch, they fell on their 
Jinees, and offered a prayer to the 
throne of grace, for the repose of 
her soul, and then formed a group, 
which composed an interesting picture. 
Imagine you see the little trembling 
party in the centre of a cold damp 
chamber, decorated with all the so- 



138 AtEXENA; OR THE 

lemnity of the grave, in the fore ground, 
tliree incomparable female figures 
leaning over one of the loveliest Torms 
the breath of life had ever animated,, 
while the pearly tears of unfeigned^ 
sorrow bedewed their cheeks. Be- 
tween light and shade, a monk in the 
attitude of a man lost in profound 
thought; his waist encompassed by a 
leather belt furnished wiih a rosary; 
and in the back ground, a cavalier 
leaning against a pillar's shaft, wrapped 
in a friar's gown ; his bosom decorated 
with an embroidered vest and the po- 
lished hilt of a bright stiletto, while 
grief and pity contend which shall 
best express his feelings. 

' Come, come,' said Bernardo, as he 
started from his reverie, ' haste, haste, 
lest you share Ellena's cold pillov// 
For a moment they heard him not ; an 
unaccountable attraction, fixed all their 
faculties; Lord Mortimer threw him- 
self on his knees, then caught the beau- 
teous hand of the murdered novice, and 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 130 

imprinted on it a warm^ fervent kiss of 
affection; of regret,, and another on 
those lips that once breathed ambrosial 
sweetness; imagination cannot paint, 
or fancy form^ a more interesting ob- 
ject; his lordship's tears fell thick on 
her bosom^ that then ceased to heave, 
but was as fair as the snow on the 
mountain. Alexena clasped her clay 
cold form to her heart, and sobbed 
audibly, while the other females v^ere 
not less distressed. It was with diffi- 
culty Bernardo forced them from this 
melancholy scene, but at length their 
fears prevailed^ and they hurried to 
the door which opened on the rocks. 
They passed through many a dripping 
cold damp vault, cell, and chamber, 
lit only here and there by solitary 
torches, before they arrived at those 
gates which opened to liberty; at 
length they reached them, Bernardo 
laid his liberating hand on the mas- 
sive bars, and already removed two 
of the three that enclosed them in this 
iivins: tomb. At that moment Lord 



140 ALEXENA ; OR TUB 

Mortimer spied a figure move through 
the gloom in the distant extremityof th» 
Yault, and pointed it out to his friend, 
who made a sign, and they softly dre\T 
their daggers ; it approached — every 
instant his lordship expected to hearth* 
women scream; if they did, all were un- 
done ; it still moved forward, at length 
stopping within a few yartls, they 
were convinced it discovered them. 
Bernardo groaned aloud. Lord Morti- 
mer sprang forward to seize the intru- 
der, or put it to death, if not already 
an inhabitant of the other world ; but 
he had not advanced two paces, until 
the subject of their fears, sunk senseless 
on the earth. She was a young and 
lovely woman; his lordship lifted her, 
and was the next moment beside 
Bernardo. 'Unbolt the gale, quickly,' 
said he, 'and we are yet free;' 
his words were not thrown awav, the 
last ponderous bolt was withdrawn, 
and the scene changed ; the door was 
pulled too, and they fled for their 
lives.

The lady who had alarmed them in 
the dungeon, was soon made sensible 
of her happy reverse of fortune ; tears 
of joy ran down her pale cheeks, as she 
nimbly ascended the precipices. In 
a few minutes they arrived at th« 
bridge, where Rourke and Albert waited 
with six English servants, well mounted 
and armed, besides their guides. They 
were first alarmed at the approach of 
so many^ though his lordship, at Ber- 
nardo's request, had ordered two ad- 
ditional horses, the latter having pre- 
viously resolved to save Evelene and 
her friend. The ladies were soon placed 
in their saddles. Lord Mortimer and his 
attendants then mounted, Bernardo 
was accommodated with Albert's horse, 
who sat behind the guide, and they 
were about to move forward, when 
Hourke fell on his knees, and with up- 
lifted hands, exclaimed : ' Heaven be 
' praised, my master is safe, but from 
' my soul, I wish that the devil may fly 
'away with abbot and abbess, monks, 
* nuns, racksj wheels^ gibbets^ dun-

saddle, led the way, while the rest 
followed at as quick a pace as they 
could proceed at, for some time, and 
when they gained the level, galloped 
towards Valladolid, as fast as their 
animals could carry them.

first stage, and then only stopped to 
change their monastic dress, for com-

Albert had in readiness Day-light

^conventj and they had great hopes 
their CvScape was not even then dis- 
covered. Bernardo's absence would 
be the first noticed^, and it was likely 
several hours would intervene before 
his non-appearance should either 
excite alarm or suspicion, as he was 
obliged to attend the sick, and those 
'who were punished with the torture, 
in both the monastery and convent, 
which communicated with each other. 
The ladies were much fatigued, par- 
ticularly Evelene and Arabel, in con- 
sequence of their long fast ; and Vir- 
ginia, who had alarmed them at the 
door of the dungeon, was still more 
exhausted. When Lord Mortimer 
could distinguish the features of the 
latter, he found she was very lovely, 
as well as very young ; and they had 
not proceeded twenty miles before 
she seemed to have forgotten her late 
deplorable situation, from her many 
and repeated sallies of wit and merri- 
ment. Rourke, who rode close behind, 
finding tliat she enlivened the drooping 



144 alexena; or the 

spirits of the other ladies, and observing 
his master evidently obliged by her 
exertions, frequently exclaimed, though 
he did not comprehend one word she 
Baid, * God save the pretty gob on't, 
and mushen, merry be your heart/ 
Bernardo heightened the gaiety of the 
whole party, by declaring all danger 
from pursuit was over, but advised 
they should not go to Valladolid ; Met 
us/ said he, ' cross the Pyrennees, by 
' Pampeluna, enter France, and from 
' Bayonne embark for England.' This 
advice was instantly adopted by Lord 
Mortimer, as being the most secure, 
and it gave infinite satisfaction to 
the ladies, particularly to Arabel, who 
was a native of that country. 

At eleven o'clock in the forenoon, they 
stopped at a pleasant village, where 
they were regaled with cream, dried 
fruits, and excellent bread; hunger 
gave a high zest to their repast, and 
the certainty of their safety, added 
comfort to it. Lord Mortimer sat 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 145 

down^ surrounded by beauty ; Alexena 
appeared more charming than ever; 
she was dressed in a green habit, like 
those worn by the ladies of the coun- 
try ; the others in the dress of at- 
tendants. Evelene had lost nothins: of 
the beauty by which she was so much 
distinguished at Madrid, while Arabel, 
her young and delicate companion of 
the cave, tliough not quite fifteen, 
promised fair to be one of the finest 
women of the age, and Virginia, all 
mirth, gaiety, and good humoun 
claimed a large share of loveliness, and 
was a favorite with them all. Miss 
Hastings, whom, in future, we shall 
call Mrs. Hastings, loved them wi(h the 
aflfection of a parent, and always, w hen 
speaking to them, used the endearing 
epithet of my dear daughter ; and her 
fond solicitude was gratefully repaid 
by every attention in their power to 
bestow. None beheld them with 
greater satisfaction than Rourke, who 
now and then plucked Albert by the 
sleeve, and, in a kind of half whisper,

replied Tom, rather displeased, ' but 
you were not altogether so full of your

When Lord Mortimer and bishappjj 
friends had finished their repast, Ber- 
nardo urged their immediate depar- 
ture, representing- the imprudence of 
delay; and on the ladies expressing 
some rehictance, in consequence of 
their fatigue, he begged to know had 
they ah-eady forgotten the dangers from 
which they so recently escaped, ' Now/ 
he continued, 'if you have no particu- 
' lar inclination to be buried or roasted 
' alive; to have your bones broken piece- 
' meal on the wheel, or drawn asunder 
^ on the rack, I advise you to pursue 
' your journey with all possible expe- 
* dition, until you reach Pampeluna, 
' where you may rest a few days in 
' perfect security/ Bernardo's advice 
was attended to, and they proceeded 
without halting, except at night, until 
they arrived in the neighbourhood of 
Estella, on the Pyrennees, about seven 
leagues from the above city, wliere 
they enjoyed a few days repose. 

As it was summer, the evenings were 
ilelightful, and they often vvander&d

Among' the mountains, to enjoy the 
cool shade of the myrtle groves that 
skirted their sides; then each told a (ale, 
or sung a glee, to enliven the evening 
hour. Oil ona of those excursions, 
being fatigued with the length of their 
walk, and the roughness of the paths 
among the precipices, they sought a 
recess in an adjacent rock, where they 
might indulge their weary limbs, with a 
few moments repose. They w ere scare® 
seated, ere Virginia, with her usual 
vivacity, said, ' I find a particular wish 
to hear myself prate, what think you : 
shall I relate how 1 had the misfortune 
to be confined in the Dominican con- 
vent? — you all appear to be dull, and 
I am resolved either to cure you by 
exciting your attention, or kill you 
quite with tire sad story of my life.' — 
' Ve vil, much glad to hear Mortimer, 
rent ve,' said Alexena. ' Oh ! yes,' 
replied his lordsliip, mimicking, ^very 
much glad, particularly if she could give 
the relation in such excellent English 
as you speak/ Alexena smiled, and r;as 



CASTLE OF SANTA MAKCO. ]49 

about to reply, when Virginia began 
her narrative in those words ; — 



I was born in the capital of this 
kino:dom, and recollect little of my 
early infancy, except the death of my 
mother, after which melancholv event, 
I was at the age of six years sent to a 
convent in Valencia, to be educated by 
my annt, who was the superior of it; 
and made considerable progress under 
her care, until 1 attained my fourteenth 
year, when I began to dislike a mo- 
nasiic life, which may appear rather 
strange, as I knew no other world, 
having never been forther than the 
convent garden. However, in a house 
adjoining my prison, a cavalier resided, 
who was both young and handsome, and 
one morning, as 1 was gathering flow- 
ers, he chanced to see me from a lat- 
tice ; my veil had fallen off, so he was 
gratified with a full view of my face, 
and iiistan<ly expressed his satisfaction. 
Being alone, I Tentured to look up, and

beheld Don Carlos standing at the 
\vindo'-»v ; I directly snatched up my veil, 
and was about to retire, but he con- 
jured me, for the Virgin's sake, to stay 
a few minutes; and I could not resist^, 
though I was aware of my imprudence. 
He then informed me, he had spent 
■whole weeks, nay months, patiently 
watching for that blessed opportunity, 
and then threw down a letter, without 
asking my permission ; what could I do 
but take it? to leave it tiiere until found 
by some of the nuns, might be attended 
with fatal consequences, not only to 
Don Carlos, but myself; to return it was 
utterly impossible, and to deny that I 
had a strons: inclination to see what it 
contained, would be untrue. I therefore 
placed it in my bosom, which gave my 
beau great satisfaction, and after he 
had extorted a promise that I would 
attend in the same place, and at the 
same hour, the following morning, he 
kissed his hand, and I retired, lest I 
should be observed by any of the 
sisters ; then flew with impatience to 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 151 

my cell, to enjoy in solitude the letter 
of Don Carlos, which was a little vo- 
lume of lave, of kisses, of sighs, and 
of tears, accompanied with a lively 
description of dances, balls^ entertain- 
ments, plays, galas, routes, and mas^ 
querades, which he had himself enjoy- 
ed. I read this letter asrain and a^rain, 
and it is unnecessary to say, that it made 
me heartily sick of the convent's dull 
routine ; I wished for the morrow, that I 
might again see Carlos, whom, I believe, 
I then began to like greatly ; and next 
morning I was sure to be under the 
lattice at the appointed hour. In a 
moment after he appeared, and let down 
by a cord, a book and another letter; 
this last was like the former, but with 
this difference, that in it he proposed 
assisting me to escape, and intreating 
me to marry him, as the only remedy to 
avoid taking the veil, which my father 
somotiine before had commanded me 
to prepare for. I pretended to be an- 
gry at tliis hasty declaration, and left 
the garden apparently displeased, (hen

and 1 soon ])ecame delighted, as it was 
the first production of the kind 1 had ever

ladies, magicians, enchanters, giants, 
dwarfs, huge castles, and love- sick 
kniohts, chained to tovverino^ battlements,

and give him some faint hopes — Poor 
soul ! he had been in the dismals from 
the moment I vanished, and almost 
flew out of the casement on seeing me 
again. He was as impudent as ever, 
and so tormenting, that in less than 
a month, he absolutely persuaded me to 
consent to be his. The moment I ^-ave it, 
he made preparations for our flight, and 
the third night after, by the assistance 
of a rope ladder, I found myself in his 
apartment, and in a few minutes more, 
on the back of a spirited courser on the 
road to Orgiva, from which place we 
intended to sail for Italy, and there re- 
main until such time as my father should 
be reconciled. Don Carlos' sister ac- 
companied us, and in less than an hour, 
the proud city of Valencia was some 
miles behind. The Fates, however, were 
not long propitious; I was missed at 
early matins, and instantly pursued. 
We were overtaken v.ilhin a few miles 
of the sea-port, and after a desperate, 
though fruitless, resistance, on the part 
©f Don Carlos, in which he was left

senseless on the road, his sister and I 
were led back towards Valencia — she to 
mourn the loss of the best of brothers, 
and I to pine away the remainder of 
my wretched existence, in the prison 
from which I so recently congratulated 
myself I had escaped. For the first 
day we travelled without interrup- 
tion, but on the second we met my 
father, who had an order from the 
abbess to the officers, to restore me to 
him should I be captured. This they 
instantly complied with, and the fol- 
lowing- moment I was surrounded bj 
my father's domestics, who watched 
me with more vigilance than they 
would have done, had I been a 
state prisoner. Immediately after the 
departure of the inquisitorial agents, 
my father reviled me in the bitterest 
terms, and swore he would instantly 
conduct me to the convent of Domini- 
cans, the harshest in the w^orld, where, 
at the expiration of my noviciate, I 
should be compelled to take the veil, 
and pass the remainder of my life in 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 155 

the most austere seclusion. On hearinir 
this dreadful sentence, I wept^ prayed^ 
and intreated, but all in vain ; notliiufj 
could soften him. So we travelled in 
silence towards Tortosa, where he had 
some business, and from that place I 
was to be conducted to the convent. 
On our arrival there, my father was 
surprised to find my uncle Oriso, and 
in a few minutes after, was overwhelm- 
ed with grief^ when informed his only 
son had died suddenly. Though I 
had never seen m.y brother, I was 
greatly shocked on hearing of his 
death, and from the agitation of both 
my body and mind, I became extremely 
ill, so much so, that 1 was despaired 
of. My father was in the greatest 
distress imaginable, as I was now his 
only child, and made compensation 
for his late severity, by his unre- 
mitting attention during the period of 
my illness. At length I began to re- 
cover, and was blest with the assur- 
ance, that I should never again enter 
a convent, except by my own desire, 
aod added to my happiness, by

lover, and when he found Don Carlos 
was every way unobjectionable, he 
consented to bestow mv hand on him. 
should he have survived the cruelty of 
the inquisitors. About a month after 
my brother's death, my father was 
summoned to attend his majesty, with- 
out a moment's delay, and was 
obliged to leave me under the protec- 
tion of my uncle, as I was yet too 
weak to travel wiih tlie rapidity that it 
was necessary he should use, but pro- 
mised to follow him next day, by easy 
stages, to Madrid ; which place, how- 
ever, my uncle had previously resolved 
I should never see. I conceived he 
was the best of men, but we are all 
liable to be deceived by appearances. 
as under the mask of kindness he con- 
cealed the villain ; his attention, and 
pretended esteem, gradually gained 
my affection, and I conceived myself 
blest, by being so nearly allied to so 
worthy a man: sometimes he would 
pat m.e on the checks, and *Jij, I was 
the prettiest^ sweetest, finest, liveliest.

and most agreeable little i>;irl in the 
universe; yet he could scarcely sup- 
press his joy, on seeing my father de- 
part, and leave me an easy, defenceless 
prey, which he resolved to make sure 
of as soon as possible, as I was the 
only surviving- obstacle between him 
and my father's vast possessio ns. 

About four hours after my parent 
left Tortosa, Don Oriso entered my 
apartment, with an open letter in his 
hand, and feigned sorrow on his coun- 
tenance; I felt alarmed, and begged to 
know had any new misfortune befallen 
our house? * There has, my dear Virgi- 
nia,' he replied, ' and I am sorry to be 
' the bearer of ill news. Your father's 
' horse stumbled, and fell with him, 
' about ten miles from this, and the con- 
^ seoiience is, he has received a severe

I instantly proposed we should set out^ 
but my uncle beg-ged I would not 
expose my constitution to the night air, 
as he felt apprehensive it might cause 
a relapse, and added many other per- 
suasive arguments ; though at the same 
moment his agitation was visible, lest I 
should comply. However, as I urged 
our immediate departure, and became 
very unhappy, Don Oriso said, he could 
not oppose me any longer, and went 
out to order our horses. A little before 
twilight, we were on the road ; the 
feathered warblers had retired to seek 
repose in the leafy grove, save the 
nightingale, sweet melancholy song- 
stress of the night, who poured her 
plaintive tale on the airy breeze, that 
swept with gentle murmur the tops 
of the surrounding foliage. I lent an 
attentive ear as I passed the grove ; 
the hour was soothing to my soul, it 
was in unison with my feelings, and 
the grotesque figures, formed by the 
crimson clouds of eveniu!? on the 
dark shade of <he distant landscape, 
added to the beauty of the picture.

We travelled in silence^, I lamentins: 
my father's misfortune, and tortured 
vrith the painful remembrance of my late 
happiness ; my uncle riding by my side, 
building castles in the airy perspective 
of his imagination, with the fortune 
which should be his, as soon as I slept 
in the long silence of the tomb. It 
was about the solitary hour of one. 
when we stopped at a small hovel on 
a cross road to chans^e horses : while 
they were preparirig, I refreshed my- 
self with a short walk, and enjoyed the 
pure sea breeze ; the night was calm 
and lovely, all was silent, save the mur- 
muring of the distant waves, as they 
broke against the rocks. It was then 



the hour, 



The holy hour, when to the cloudless height 
Of yon starr'd concave, climbs the full orb'd moon.

love, and as 1 raised them towardis 
Heaven, I called down a blessing- on 
my j)arent, and fervently hesonght Al- 
mighty Providence, to look with pity on 
my helplessness, and if not yet too late, 
to restore Don Carlos to his Virginia. 
At this moment I heard myself called, 
and on reaching the spot where my 
attendants were standing, I inquired 
for my unclcj and was answered by 
a strange figure, that he had gone on a 
little before. I refused to move until 
he should be called back; but a horrid 
looking ruffian seized and placed me 
on horseback, then, with dreadful im- 
precations, threatened to assassinate me 
if I made the smallest noise or resist- 
ance. A full conviction of the terrors of 
my situation, and of Don Oriso's vil- 
lainy, instantly deprived me of motion, 
and I should have fallen from my horse, 
had I not been timely prevented by 
one of my uncle's inhuman attendants. 
T^eturning animation only served to 
aggravate my sorrow, and in an inex- 
pressible agony of soul, I called on 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 161 

my father and Don Carlos to assist, 
to rescue me, but was again threat- 
ened by the villains^ who forced me 
along at a quicker pace ; and the 
barren waste over which we travelled 
forbade a hope of relief I then in- 
treated the Father of Mercies^ to avert 
the gathering' storm which appeared 
ready to burst on my devoted head ; 
he heard my prayer^ and it was regis- 
tered in Heaven. ]My guards, in a 
short time, turned into a path that led 
directly to the sea coast., and we ar- 
rived at a gloomy old building, just as 
the sun had illumined with his first 
trembling rays the tops of the sur- 
rounding cliffs. It was much decayed 
by the all-withering hand of time, the 
left wing having already been nearly 
level with the dust; there, the pale 
father of destruction might have erect- 
ed his throne of terro.s, it was so bare, 
so barren, and so desolate, in front; 
the sea spread boundless and unfa- 
thomable, And_ scarce was the weary 
eye ever relieved by the glimpse of a 



162 ALEXENA; on THE 

distant sail; it stood in the entrance 
of a deep valley^ screened by " rocks 
on rocksj piled as if by magic spell/' 
and there my conductors stopped, and 
Mere admitted by a wretched old wo- 
man, cross, crooked, and wrinkled^ more 
by ill-nature than by age; her face was 
an index on which you might read 
her disposition ; and I was scarce suf- 
fered to aliirht, before she drove me 
into a dark miserable apartment, with- 
out fire or furniture, save a broken 
chair and a half rotten mattress, whick 
lay mouldering on the damp floor. I 
besought her not to leave me in that 
cold chamber to perish, but intreaties 
were vain; she gruffly refused, and in 
a harsh and squeaking voice, told me 
my troubles were near a conclusion ; 
then hobbled to the door, and securely 
locked it after her. Dreary was the 
scene by which I was surrounded ; left 
in the solitude of a gloomj^ and ex- 
tensive chamber, feebly lit by one 
small grated window; the panes were 
broken, and the howling blast which 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 163 

guslied through them^ agitated the 
moth-eaten tapestry that hung rudely- 
suspended on the walls; the grim 
figures of which seemed to frown on me, 
and served to increase the terrors of 
my mind, ah'eady enervated by fatigue ; 
every instant I expected death, as it 
was a place fit for the commission of 
'' midnight's pale murders/' Hopeless, 
and stupid with despair, I threw my- 
self on the mattress, and gazing, wan- 
dered over the grotesque figures on the 
hangings, 'till fancy almost gave them 
animation. I wished, yet feared, to 
withdraw my eyes, lest the gigantic 
forms should start from the canvass, 
and became terrified on observing a 
particular spot shake, which directly 
fronted the window ; however, on reflec- 
tion, I conceived there might be a door 
behind it, through which I might eflfect 
my escape; delighted at the idea, I 
crossed the room, and hastily lifted the 
drapery; but imagine my consternation, 
on seeing in anitchin the wall, a bundle 
©f linen, and a poinard stained with 



164 ALEXENA ; OK THE 

blood ; I ventured to lift the latter, 
which was rusty from the lime it had 
lain in its place of concealment^ and 
carried it to the light, where I dis- 
covered the name Oriso dc Sileno, en- 
graven on its handle. — Oh! horror — 
my uncle ! — I let the curtain drop — 
my bosom ceased to heave — -.1 stag- 
gcred_, and fell senseless on the floor. 

The sun cast his last rays into the 
chamber, before I could recal to my 
half distracted brain the recent scene ; 
ray head ached violently, and I suffered 
severely from a bruise which I received 
by falling against the old chair. i3eing 
weak, sick, hungry, and dry, it was 
with great difliculty I crawled to my 
wretched couch, where I impiously 
wished for death to put a period to my 
misfortunes. My spirits were very 
weak, and I sunk into a kind of slum- 
ber, from which I was roused by the 
sound of a footstep, and on raising my 
head, I conceived I saw a figure move 
through the dusk towards the door;

trembling and agitated, 1 could scarce 
summon courage to address this un- 
welcome intruder ; to my question, a 
voice replied, 'it is I, lady; lam the 
5 owner of this old building, and you 
•^are entrusted to my care; I came into 
' the room with some bread and fish — 
' (he only food which can be procured 
' hereabouts — and was about to retire 
•^when 1 disturbed you.' I inquired 
w^here he had left my scanty meal : — * on 
' the old chair, lady ; and I shall come 
'to-morrow with some venison, if it can 
* be procured.' I thanked him, and as 
he retired, I shuddering, listened to 
his receding footsteps; and as he 
passed the window, through which the 
moon's pale rays played faintly, they 
cast a sicknin^- liijht on his visaije, 
stained with many a foul and nameless 
crime. The door was once more 
locked, and all again was silent, save 
the thunder that bellowed at a distance, 
and the raging sea that hurled its angry 
billows against the adjacent rocks. 
The night soon became awfully dark.

the rain fell in torrents, and the stornak 
shook the building to its very founda- 
tions; now and then the pale red liHit- 
ning swept through the chamber, and 
by its mazy windings, dispersed for a 
moment the gloom by which I was 
surrounded. I used every exertion to 
fright the drowsy god, but in vain; 
fatigue had administered too strong an 
opiate, and, notwithstanding my strug- 
gles, I fell asleep; it is true, sleep 
would have been most desirable from 
the moment I entered my prison, had 
not the idea of murder, and the wretch 
who had entered my apartment, haunted 
my imagination. I suspected him, 
his intentions, and the food which he 
brought ; the last I resolved not to 
touch, lest it should have been poi- 
soned. Sound was the sleep that locked 
my exhausted faculties, and scarce had 
Somnus sealed my weary eyes, ere my 
inhuman keeper returned, to execute 
his bloody purpose ; he entered softly, 
but had then nothing to fear, for it 
would have been a matter of much

-difficulty to disturb me. When he 
entered, he put off his heavy shoes, 
and cautiously advanced into the apart- 
ment ; he drew the fatal dag-g^er, and 
proceeded on tip-toe to the spot where 
I lay; having reached it, he gently bent 
one knee, and stretched forth his tawny 
neck — beneath lay his unresisting vic- 
tim. The murderous weapon was 
raised, but the moon, sickning at the 
black deed about to be perpetrated, 
withdrew behind a sable cloud, and 
blushed at man's brutality, leaving the 
vile assassin in almost impenetrable 
darkness. He turned his wild and im- 
patient eye towards the starry concave, 
and muttered a curse at this momentary 
disappointment : however, the twink- 
iins: liirht of the unkind stars, served 
to shew the robe that covered my bo- 
som, and he delayed a moment to re- 
move it ; this also ho effected, then, 
for the last time, pointed the pitiless 
steel — (all the man now fled, and an 
inhuman devil assumed his form,)— 
and nerved the arm that aimed a 



168 alexena; or the 

blow at my heart ; the motion was 
made to strike, but (hat instant he fell 
a corpse at my feet. A ball, directed 
by a lover's hand, passed swift as 
lightning through his heart ; the death- 
dealing tube rattled on the floor, while 
I, amazed, started, screaming, from my 
sleep, and fled, terror-struck, to the 
door, where I sunk senseless into the 
arms of my Carlos. 

As I revived, he exclaimed, 'oh! my 

* love, my soul's joy, let us hasten from 
' those regions of sorrow, for a curse 
' rests on this house ; not without un- 
' utterable toil have I again found you, 
' and at what a time too, when the 
' poinard of the assassin was levelled at 
' your life ; how I came here, I will re- 
' late hereafter; let us now hasten to a 
' place of safety, while we have yet the 

* power.' He then led me down a dark 
tairs, through a long hall, out of the 

mansion, and at a trifling distance, 
had a trusty servant with horses in 
waiting, which we instantly mounted, 
and galloped for some miles^ as fast as 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 1G9 

our poor animals could carry us. 
When we conceived ourselves safe 
from pursuit, we slackened our pace, 
to deliberate on what course it were 
best to pursue^ and resolved to fasten 
to Madrid, being now certain of my 
fathers protection, and proceeded in 
safety as far as a little house on the 
common, within half a mile of the 
monastery of Benedictine monks, and 
within two of the Dominican convent, 
where, to my inexpressible grief, we 
stopped to sup, and procure fresh 
horses. Don Carlos went to the stable, 
and a moment after his servant came 
to say, Uhat fresh animals could not be 
'had, and that we should be obliged to 
' travel with the former : one of these are 
' lame Signiora, and my lord is gone to 

* see the shoe taken off, as he would not 
' trust me, for fear of delay .' ' How far is 

* it to the smith's?' said I : — ' about a 
' quarter of a mile down the road, 
"^Signiora; you need not be uneasy, for 

^' my lord will be here immediately.' I 
then sent him to hasten Don Carlos, as

supper wailed, but he had not left the 
house two minutes, before it was filled 
with armed men, who instantly seized, 
and conveyed me to the Dominican 
convent. Thus had the accidental 
lameness of the horse rendered me 
miserable, and, I fear, the wretches sur- 
prised my Carlos, for I have never 
heard of him since. In a few horn's 
I was conveyed before the abbess, who 
pretended to compassionate my suffer- 
ings; and it was not till after the con- 
clusion of a long' lecture, I understood 
my uncle had been at the convent, and 

, informed her that I was a professed nun, 
who had broken my vows, for which 
crime, he abandoned me to the rigour 
of the clmrch, ^ You are,' said the 
abbess, addressing me, ' to be tried for 
' this heinous ofil^nce to-morrow nioht, 
' at twelve o'clock, and if you have any 
* defence to make, prepare it quickly; 
'I shall order pen, ink, and paper ; 

/write the names of 3'our witnesses, 
' and ihoy shall be summoned.* — 'Poor 
wretch,' .she continued *■ what ca n they 



CASTLE or SANTA MARCO. 171 

* avail you, when your crime is already 
' proved by numbers within these walls.' 
I was struck motionless with horror, 
and in a few nninutes found myself in 
a dark cell, where I was left to medi- 
tate on all the terrors of approaching 
ileath. 

The hour arrived too soon ; at eleven 

^ext night, I was conducted into a 

gloomy chamber hung- with black, in 

the middle of which there was a table, 

at which the abbess sat, with the prior 

of the Dominicans on the right hand, 

and two old nuns on the left. There 

was little ceremony, as in compliment 

to my connexion, my trial was what is 

called a private one, it being the wish 

of those good souls to hide my shame 

from the world. On bein"; led before 

my judges, the prior read a deposition 

of my uncle Oriso, and of two of his 

attendants, which stated, I had escaped 

from a convent of the order of St. 

Dominick, situated on the confines of 

Portugal, and lived in infamy with Don 

h2 



T72 ALEXENA : on THE 



Carlos. This, of course, I denied, and 
related with truth and accuracy every 
occurrence of my life, to which they 
listened with the utmost patience ; and 
when I had finished, the prior rose to 
pass the dreadful sentence,without even 
making a single observation on what I 
had said. The abbess drew her veil 
close, and the nuns crossed their hands 
on their bosoms, almost petrified with 
awe. He then raised his voice, and 
pronounced these words : Hija vasotros 
sufrireis aqui, pero grandes son las 
mercedes que Dios hace a los pecadores* 
They then exhorted me to repent, and 
make good use of the few moments I 
had yet to live, and instantly after re- 
tired. My imagination was then be- 
ifrildered, and 1 began to hope what I 
heard was a dream, when two horrid- 
looking ruffians hurried me to an ad- 
joining cell, where they bound my feet, 
and dragged me to the eilge of a pe- 
destal, which they removed, and dis- 

* " Daughter, you shall suffer here ; but great is 
''•the mercy which God conferii upon sinners." 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 173- 

covered the mouth of a dark yawning' ' 
pit. I guessed their intentions.and made 
tlie vaulty cave echo with my screams. 
One of the executioners drew his stiletto, 
— I trusted, for the purpose of silencing 
me for ever; and I wished it, when I be- 
held the horrid maw of the gaping 
abyss, which was partially revealed by 
the bickering light of the glaring torch 
that he held over it. ' Oh ! in mercy, kill 
' me/ I exclaimed, 'ere you consign me 
* to this tomb of terrors/ '^I cannot,' said 
this messenger of death, 'for though my 
' compassion prompts me to comply with 
'your request, prudence forbids it, as my 
' life would pay the forfeit of my lenity.' 
The death-peal now rolled through 
those caverns of misery, and I felt it 
rung the fiat of my fate, and announced 
the conviction by a wild cry of despair^ 
while the pallid and ghastly looks of 
the executioners seemed to say, they 
had already loitered too long. One of 
them held me, and the other wound my 
veil round my hands; then lifted my 
fainting form over the dark vaultj 



J74 ALEXEXA ; OR TfIB 

and both exclaiming, ' Heaven have 
mercy !' — let me fall headlong from their 
grasp into the gulph of death. When 
they heard the shock below, they placed 
the trap-door in its former position, and 
retired. I remained insensible for a 
considerable time, from the bruise, and 
a deep wound on my head ; but awaked 
too soon to the horrors of my situation ; 
on attempting to move, I found myself 
lying on the cold and lifeless corpse of 
some wretched victim, which, from its 
decayed state, must have remained there 
a considerable time. This trying mo- 
ment was, however, compensated for, 
by the timely assistance of a good sister, 
who almost immediately entered my 
tomb, and removed me to a cell which 
communicated with it, where she dressed 
my wound, and brought me food every 
night ; I was also supplied with linen, 
and other necessaries, until two days 
before our escape, when she disconti- 
nued her visits, and I am yet unac- 
quainted with the reason. Necessity, 
at length, urged me to enter the long

vaulty avenue^ through a sliding- pannel, 
with the secret of whicli Madeline had 
made me conversant; it bein^ imper- 
ceptible to the eye of a partial observer, 
being formed in the wall, and painted 
the colour of the stones. I roamed 
through the passage in searcli of food, 
for the want of which I was in aijonv, 
but neither could, nor dare, make my 
wretchedness known ; and I was aU 
most without hope, when I saw you ; 
then, conceiving I was discovered by 
some of the inhuman officers of tlie 
institution, I fainted, and you already 
know what followed. 

Here Virginia concluded, and her tale 
added interest to her beauty. As it was 
then almost dark. Lord Mortimer and 
bis friends returned to their rustic hotel, 
to enjoy the comfortable warmth of a 
sparkling fire, and feast on'thc game, 
procured from the adjacent mountains.

J Julius C-esar, 

v/N reluming towards the inn, they 
observed a considerable crowd gather- 
ed round a strange figure, who was 
haranguing them in an odd kind of 
gibberish. Lord Mortimer felt some- 
what alarmed at seeing so many people, 
and sent Rourke to inquire the mean- 
ing of it; in a moment he returned, 
with word, ' that a fortune-teller was 
' amusing the peasant girls, by giving 
* them a sketch of theirfuture lives. And 
' I would be glad to know,' said Rourke, 
' what time we shall find ourselves in 
'Hollywood-Castle; he shall have a 
' piece of a dollar if he can tell me that.' 
' Send him after us,' said his lordship, 
' that we may be able to judge of his

' abilities^ and if not a very dull rogue, 
' it is possible he may afford some 
' amusement. What say you, my fair 
' friends? will you not be rejoiced to hear 
' the day and hour you are to have 
^ husbands ?' ' Oh ! yes, let us hear 
^ him instantly/ said Virginia, ' there is 
' a possibility he can tell whether Carlos 
'yet lives.' Lord Mortimer smiled at 
her simplicity, and shortly after they 
reached the house, Rourke announced 
the diviner; he was dressed in a green 
baize cloak, a belt of red leather 
round his waist, a kind of helmet on 
his head, a large black patch over one 
eye, and the lower part of his face co- 
vered with thick brown hair. When he 
made his obeisance, his lordship re- 
quested to know his name and pro- 
fession ; to which he replied, ' my name 
' is Almanarazibub, known in every 
' province of Spain, as well as in every 
' part of Africa ; I can tell things 
' past, present, and to come, and you 
' are welcome to make tlie trial.' — 'Me 
' don't like him, he be not good,' said

Almanarazibub — ' you are called Lord

them all. His lordship then felt far from 
comfortable, an<l was almost convinced 
they were discovered by the Dominican 
officers, but resolved to ask another 
question, and said, ' Signior, has any 

* thing particular occurred to any of us 
' within these two months past?' 'Yes! 
' you were in a dungeon not three weeks 
' ago, and are only now flying from your 
' pursuers.* ' Dear me,* exclaimed the 
innocent Virginia, ' then you know we 
' have recently escaped from the Domi- 
' nican convent.' This abrupt and 
thoughtless confession excited consi- 
derable alarm ; but the artless girl 
proceeded without being aware of her

intliscretion, by saying-, ' Pray, as 

* you seem so well acquainted v.ith 
' our affairs, tell me what has become 
' of a cavalier, named Don Carlos de 
' Herman? is he livinsf or dead? — but, 
' oh I if the latter, don't tell me so, or 

' I will instantly ' She paused, 

and blushed deeply, while the starting 
tear trembled in her eye. ' You would 
die with grief, Signiora,' observed Al- 
manarazibub. ' What ! will you re- 

* ward me handsomely, if I restore this 

* Don Carlos in half an hour?' ' Reward 

* you !' cried Virginia ; ' I will give you 
^ every thing I have in this world.' 
' Indeed ! — well, 1 take you at your 
' word ; you are now mine for ever,' 
and then clasped Virginia to his bo- 
som. Lord Mortimer's eyes sparkled 
with indisrnation, as he laid his hand 
on his sword ; and had not the beard 
of the soothsayer fallen on the floor, 
it is probable he would have shaved it 
off, and the head along with it; but a 
wild scream from Virginia, proved that 
Don Carlos himself stood before her. 



180 ALEXENA; OR THE 

Words are inadequate to express the 
satisfaction of all the joarties, at this 
most unexpected meeting ; the bosom 
of the lo\e!y Vir<jinia oerflowed with 
the iiigh tide of her feelings, and she 
momentarily sunk under the pressure; 
a shower of tears, however, relieved her 
almost bursting heart, and when once 
composed, was the happiest of the 
happy. De Herman was a cavalier of 
the first address; good-natured, brave, 
generous, and open hearted— and truly 
deserved her. After mutual cong-'atu- 
lations, he related in as lew words as 
possible, what had occurred since his 
first separation from Virginia. 

You may remember he was left 
senseless on the read leading to Orgiva, 
by the inquisitorial officers; but a few 
moments after thev were out of si»;ht, 
some of his domestics, who had fled, 
returned, antl conveyed him to a little 
village, about a league from the place 
"where he had been wounded. When 
Ids wounds were examined, they were 



CASTLE OF SANTA MAIICO. 181 

neither deep nor dangerous, and in 
about a week, he was able to set out in 
pursuit of Virginia. He arrived at Tor- 
tossa. in disguise, and soon found she 
Nvas seriously indisposed, but dare not 
make himself known ; he contrived, 
however, to introduce himself to the 
physician, who gave a minute detail 
of the progress of her disorder, and of 
her happy restoration to convalescence. 
It was the doctor who informed him of 
her sudden departure from the town, 
and he set out in two hours after, at- 
tended by a servant, who led a horse, 
ready prepared with a lady's saddle, 
in case he should be so fortunate as 
again to rfescue her from the grasp of 
tyranny ; conceiving her father was 
conducting her to some dismal con- 
vent, where she should pine away the 
remainder of her existence in despair 
and wretchedness. 

When he reached the cabin on the 



182 ALEXEVA ; OR THE 

cross road, all powerful gold enabled 
him to trace her to her prison, where, 
with much difficulty, he obtained 
admission. On his entry, he heard 
voices in earnest conversation, in a 
distant part of the old building-, and 
groped his way through a decayed 
corridore, to a small room adjacent 
to that in which the persons were 
talking, and then overheard the 
bloody agent of Oriso, telling an old 
sorceress, who was governess of the 
fabric, the amount of the reward he 
was to have for despatching Virginia. 
After emptying a flask of wine, to 
the health of his employer, he flou- 
rished a dagger, and came forth 
from the apartment, with stern intent 
to commit the barbarous deed, and 
ascended" a crazy old stairs which led 
to her chamber. De Herman followed 
at a distance, with light steps and an 
agitated heart; and observed the as- 
sassin, as he softly unlocked (he door, 
look cautiously round, and cither 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 183 

listen or consider for a moment. Car- 
los stood in the dark shade of one of 
the columns that supported the roof, 
until the villain entered the room ; then 
drew a pistol from his belt, and pre- 
pared it ; being dark, it was with much 
difficulty he could distinguish his ob- 
ject, and at all events, did not wish to 
fire, lest he should not be in the apart- 
ment in which Virginia was confined. 
As he yet hesitated, he thought he saw 
the murderer stoop, but on advancing 
a few paces, accurately distinguished 
his extended arm, and being impressed 
with the conviction of his merciless 
intention, presented his fatal machine, 
and when the wretch again raised his 
arm to strike, the ball passed through 
his bosom : — he fell — Carlos staggered 
back, and the next moment Virginia 
was senseless in his arms. The report 
of the pistol did not alarm the old 
beldame, and they got clear off. 

About an hour before day-break, 
they arrived at the inn on the com- 



2S1 alexena; or the 

mon, but as Virginia has already re- 
lated what occurred there^ it is unne- 
cessary to repeat it. 

On the return of Don Carlos, it is 
impossible to describe his feelings. 
Anselmo used his utmost powers of 
persuasion, to induce him to fly, but 
in vain ; in fact, he was incapable, for 
in a few minutes, the shock deprived 
him of reason, and in that miserable 
condition he remained concealed many 
days. When sufficiently recovered, 
Anselmo informed him of Virginia's 
escape, and many other particulars, 
which were likely to assist him in 
finding her again, and he then set out 
in quest of her. As it is impossible to 
elude a lover's eye, when in pursuit of 
his mistress, he successfully traced her 
to the little town of Estella, in that 
disguise which he had the precaution 
to adopt ; and to avoid the possibility 
of discovery, sent his servant forward 
with the horses to Pampeluna, with 
orders to wait his arrival. ' You see'. 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 185 

said Don Carlos, ' I have been able to 
' find yoUj notwithstanding the dis- 
' tance ; I therefore intreat you w ill 
' leave this place as soon as possible, 
' lest we again fall into the hands of 
' our ever to be dreaded foe.' The 
prudence of this caution was too ap- 
parent, not to meet with general ap- 
probation, and in pursuance of his 
advice, the following morning the entire 
party were on their journey. 

Don Carlos wrote an authentic state- 
ment of all the recent occurrences to 
Don Vasquez, who was then in Ma- 
drid, and promised to await his arrival 
in Pampeluna. 

The ladies left Estella with some 
regret, as they had spent a few days 
there most agreeably. Nothing mate-

nia's fiither had the felicity of clasphig 
his Ions: lost daiurhter to his bosom, 
whom he had mourned as dead, and 
never expected to see again in this 
world. 

The day Don Vasquez received tlie 
letter of Don Carlos, he had Oriso ar- 
rested and conveyed to the Inqiiisiiion, 
where he was accused, but denied every 
charge until lie was put to the question, 
and then torture, and the certainty of 
Virginia's safety, induced him to make 
a full confession of his guilt. He ac- 
knovvleged that he poisoned his ne- 
phew, and contrived the plan by which 
he became master of Virginia's person, 
and his orders were even issued for her 
assassination, in the spot where many 
others had fallen the victims of his 
lust and cruelty. Then imagine liis 
surprise, when he arrived, on finding' 
the lifeless body of his iniquitous agent 
in her stead, and his wretched old

mother howling over him ; the scene 
was not so terrilic, but he resolved to 
add to its horrors^ and instantly stabbed 
the luckless parent, and stretched her a 
lifeless corpse on the body of her son. 
An infuriated rage at Virginia's eu^ 
largementj was the cause of that dia- 
bolical act, and the nnoment after its 
perpetration, he was on his courser, on 
the road to the Donriinican convent; 
there he was certain of obtaining coun- 
cil and assistance from the abbess, who 
had long been a pander to his crimes^ 
and had received many of his munificent 
presents. She, the moment he arrived, 
desoatched her officers to the cottaije 
of Anselm.o, it being the usual rendez- 
vous of lovers, where, most unfortu- 
nately, they captured the object of 
Oriso's fears, and of his hatred. Every 
exertion was used to seize Carlos, but 
Anselmo's friendship saved him from 
certain, nay, inevitable destruction ; 
and when Oriso found the search had 
proved fruitless, he hastened to^Fadrid, 
where he deposed, that Carlos had 



1S8 ALEXENA; OR THE 

attacked and killed two of his attend- 
ants, and carried off Virginia, \Tho 
had been wounded, he feared, mortally^ 
by an accidental thrust from one of the 
combatants; but the fact was, he hoped 
the abbess had, indeed, despatched her 
before that hour. By this tale, he 
trusted his brother would be deceived, 
and Carlos proscribed. But Justice, 
though slow, seldom fails to punisli the 
votaries of crime. Oiiso was consigned- 
to the executioner^ when he conceived 
all possibility of detection was buried 
in the duns^eons of the Dominican coa^ 
vent. 

Thus lie fell, and deservedly so^ 
and the following morning Don Vas- 
qucz hastened on the wings of affec- 
tion, to his lovely daughter, and on his 
introduction to Don Carlos, thanked 
him in the liveliest terms of gratitude, 
for his disinterested love. ' You de- 
serve her,' said Don Vasquez, as he 
placed her fair hand within that of 
Pe Herman's, ' and may you be long

* happy in each other's affections.' Here 
the tears of joy rolled over his furrowed 
cheeks ; the lovers fell on their knees to 
receive his benediction, and poured 
forth the grateful effusions of their 
hearts, in thanks to him and their 
friends. Lord Mortimer and Bernardo, 
to whose exertions and kindness they 
were indebted for their present felicity. 
They now basked in the sunshine 
of fortune; the brightest prospects 
dawned on their young loves, and to 
add to their joy, Don Vasquez ap- 
pointed a day, not far distant, for the 
solemnization of their nuptials. 

The sun of the next morning had 
scarce blushed on the casement of 
Lord Mortimer's apartment, ere Don 
Carlos entered to announce the hour 
which was to make Viri^inia his for 
ever, accompanied with an intreaty, 
that his lordship would attend him at the 
joyous ceremony. On the morning of 
that day, Virginia and her happy Car- 
los, with the chief nobility of the city.

proceeded to the principal churchy 
where those fond lovers received at the 
Hymeneal altar, the nuptial benedic- 
tion. The cannon thundered their ac- 
clamation?, and were answered by the 
shonts of the populace^ who had heard 
their .story. Don Vasquez ordered 
them a quantity of wine, to drink the 
bride's liealth, which added to their 
hilarity; every thing announced festi* 
vity ; rockets were shot among the 
starry clouds, and night seemed turned 
into day, by the variety and brilliancy 
of the illuminations. Don Vasquez 
had fitted up one of the finest houses 
in the city for that splendid occasion, 
in the gardens of which, temporary 
pavilions were erected, lit by a profusion 
of variegated lamps, in which splendid 
banquets were prepared, consisting of 
every delicacy that could please the 
taste, or delight the imagination, of the 
guests. In the chief of these pavilions, 
a throne was erected for the happy pair, 
under a canopy of crimson satin, trim- 
med with gold, and adorned with all that 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 191 

exquisite taste could bestow; it was 
illumined by crystal lustres and silver 
tripodsj pending from chains of the 
same metal, while the air was perfumed 
Avith the scent of orangeries, of flower- 
ing myrtles, and odoriferous plants; 
and the soft music of the gardens^ 
which was wafted on the breeze, dis- 
pelled the silence of the night, and gave 
enchantment to the scene. 

Carlos and Virginia did not remain 
long in their splendid tent; they soon 
grew weary of the pomp, aisd shortly 
after the first refresliments were served, 
joined in the mazy windings of the 
dance, which, on their appearance, v/as 
renewed with animation, before the door 
of their pavilion. Several days suc- 
ceeded each other, varied by some new 
delight; but, at length, Don Vasquez 
was obliged to prepare for his return 
to Madrid, where his daughter and 
son-in-law were to accompany him. 

When Ihc liour of parting drew 
nighj the grief of Alexena and Virginia

proved the sincerity of their affec^ 
tions, while the bright gem of friend- 
ship started to the eye of Carlos, 
and trembled there, as he squeezed 
the hand of Lord Mortimer ; and when 
the travelling equipage of Don Vas- 
quez was announced, the ladies had 
to be forced from each other's arms. 
Virginia made Bernardo a present of 
five hundred crowns, and handsomely 
rewarded both Rourke and Albert. 
Their tears evinced their gratitude, as 
they blessed the beauteous bride, and 
Rourke swore, "^ if he ever should have 
' a child, be it son or daughter, he 
' would call it Virginia.' The parting 
was extremely painful to all, and they 
felt a melancholy satisfaction when 
it was over. Lord Mortimer accom- 
panied Carlos and his bride a few 
miles towards Madrid, and before they 
bade adieu, promised to correspond 
with each other as often as possible; 
and his lordship then hastened home, 
to prepare for the recommencement of 
his tedious journey.

her fled the vivacity that was wont to 
enliven Alexena and her friends. They 
therefore set out next day for France, 
without feeling any thing like regret, 
and were attended by four stout troop- 
ers of Biscay, well recommended for 
their zeal, courage, and fidelity ; these, 
with Rourke, Albert, and the other 
servants, well mounted, armed, and 
accoutred, formed a formidable troop. 
Their little forces proceeded in the 
following order : — first, the guides, with 
two of the Biscayans, and two ser- 
vants; each furnished with a case of 
pistols in their belts, a sabre at their 
sides, and a kind of Spanish blun- 
derbuss slung across their shoulders, 
mounted on strong fleet horses; after 
them the ladies. Lord Mortimer^ an(i

They were obliged to travel at aK 
easy pace, among' the windings of 
those stupendous mountains, which 
were overshadowed by immense pine 
forests, and excluded the view of every 
object, save the aspiring cliffs that 
rose towering above them, and w4iich 
varied the gloom of their solitary 
shades; now' and then the rough breeze 
swept their summits, and those of the 
surrounding precipices, with such dis- 
cordant grow ling, as frequently affright- 
ed the timid females. 

Arabel, while in Pampaluna, appeared 
very pensive, but now became gay and 
animated; more than once she named 
France with enthusiasm, and seemed 
to recollect her former enjoyments with 
Hbpleasure; she was then returning to 
her native country, where she hoped 

to see the friends of her infancy, and

t>ne, who was particularly dear — her 
beloved Theodore de Montoo:omeri r 
and the surrounding scenery was cal- 
culated to inspire such soothing hopes^ 
as those that warmed her ima<?;ination. 

They now reached a level spot, on 
^vhich they stood to admire the magnifi- 
cence of the scene thct widely spread in 
gay luxuriance beneath them ; over the 
top of the forests, that seemed sunk in 
the bosom of the mountains, spread in 
Avild confusion, cities, woods, and rivers ; 
here and there the izard was observ- 
able, browzing on the dizzy ledge of a 
frightful precipice, or lightly bounding 
along these Pyrennean cliffs, while the 
imagination sickened at the idea of its 
being dashed to pieces among the 
rugged rocks in the dark abyss below; 
and the eye wandered over this sublime 
scene, until it was lost in the hazv 
mists of distance. 

Sometimes fantastical battlements 
rose in all the dreadful sublimity of

gloomy grandeur, as they gleamed for 
a moment on the imagination, and were 
then lost in the shifting vapours; crags 
on tremendous crags hung impending- 
over the road, while pine forests crow n- 
ed their rough and ridgy heads; tliejr 
perpetually seemed to change as the 
splendid tints of the sun fell on them, 
and the illusions of the sight presented 
them in strange assumed forms. 

The dusky sliades of evening were 
fast approaching, as they entered a deep 
valley, rendered almost inaccessible by 
the shaggy steeps by which it was sur- 
rounded ; the guides urged tlieir weary 
and fatigued animals somewhat quicker, 
that they might reach an -inn which 
was then but a league off. Alexena 
made many observations in English, 
on the sublime landscape around them, 
and from the very imperfect manner in 
■which she pronounced the language, 
infinitely entertained Mrs. Hastings and 
Lord Mortimer. 



CASTLE OF SANTA UAllCO. 197 

At intervals, troops of mountaineers 
passed, on their return from the labours 
of the day, and gave a deep shade of 'n\- 
terest to the picturesque scenery ; often 
the hoarse barking of the shepherd's 
dog reverberated on the ear, while the 
hollow mountain answered at a distance 
with its echo. The sun had sunk in the 
horison, and as the crimson coloured 
clouds gleamed on the forests of tali 
pine, they seemed in a blaze. In the 
course of the evenini]:, a hunter, clad in 
green, met the delighted eye^ leaning 
on his bright spear, as he stood on the 
point of some jutting rock, watching 
his game with eager anxiety, and wait- 
ing the moment in which he might, with 
unerring certainty, speed his quivering 
shaft among them. 

The guides, at length, arrived at the 
door of a comfortable cottage, denomi- 
nated an iim, in which they passed the 
wight with much more comfort than they 
had calculated on, or expected among 
such solitary wilds. There were only two 



198 ALEXEHA; OR THE 

apartments in the cottage; one, a kind 
of kitchen;, the other, a chamber; the 
ladies occupied the latter; Lord Mor- 
timer, Bernardo, and the attendants, 
formed each a sort of bed of mountain 
heath in the former, on which they 
slept tolerably sound. 

They arose with the son, and break- 
fasted about ei<Aii miles from their little 
rustic hotel ; nothing could exceed the 
hilarity of the party as they proceed- 
ed, entertaining each other with merry 
tales and interesting anecdotes. Tlhe 
road grew rugged and uneven as they 
continued to ascend amongst the pines, 
over steeps piled on steeps, and crags 
upon crags; sometimes an opening 
among the mountains presented to thoi 
eye the foaming surge, as it dashed over 
the neighbouring rocks, and swept 
through the vale with unceasing fury. 
As they advanced, the prospect became 
more wild, and approached nigher a 
state of savage chaos ; almost bound- 
less forests stretched on every side^ 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 199 

and as the shades of evening fell, their 
silence was dissipated by the roaring^ 
of wolves, which struck the unprotected 
traveller with terror; and frequently, in 
the course of their journey. Lord Mor- 
timer found considerable difficulty in 
persuading Alexena and her trembling 
friends, that they, at least, were in per- 
fect security. His lordship took care 
to see the sumpter mule well provided^ 
and as the sun cast his last rays 
across the valleys, they stopped and 
enjoyed a delightful repast. A painter 
would with pleasure have ol)served, 
nay, taken a sketch of the picturesque 
appearance of their party ; the elegant 
forms of the ladies Alexena, Evelene, 
and Arabel, were finely contrasted with 
that of Bernardo, who travelled in the 
dress of a capuchin friar, as he sat by 
them on a rock, clothed with fog and 
heath flowers, and with the grotesque 
figures, and strong harsh features^ of 
th« sun-burnt Biscayans, who wore 
HI the back ground, on whose bright 
arms the light cast a strong but dusky 



SOO alexena; or the 

gleam, as they, v»'ith the attendants^ 
rested agahist the rocks^ which pro- 
jected from the steep banks that were 
overshadowed by the impending foliage. 
Their repast finished, thej pursned 
their meandering way through the 
tremendous chasms of those moun- 
tains, and as the eye roamed along the 
valley, it often caught a glimpse of a 
Pyrennean bridge, merely composed of 
one or more enormous pines, cast from 
cliff to cliff, to facilitate the hunters* 
pursuit of game, or the search of the 
mountaineer after his straggling flock ; 
underneath, there generally warbled a 
miirmurirjg rill, and the view was closed 
by the light azure-coloured clouds, that 
seemed to fall in curtain folds behind 
the tremendous arch of the perilous 
passage. 

The last gleam of departing day 
was gliding with stealthy pace over 
the wide extended landscape, as they 
slowly descended into a frightful vale, 
in which one of those dizzy bridges 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. §0k 

hung suspended from the adjacent 
precipices, and seemed to lead to a 
path among the cliffs. So high was it 
reared above the dark gulph, that ima- 
gination inflicted tortures, at the idea 
of eitlier man or beast crossina: it. 
Lord Mortimer paused for a moment, 
and beheld it in silent horror. While 
he yet stood, the distant clashing of 
swords arrested his attention ; some- 
what alarmed at this unexpected sound, 
the troopers drew close together, and 
prepared their arms. The instant after 
the combatants issued from the cliffs, 
and fast approached the airy bridge ; 
they seemed two gallant youths, and 
fought with desperate valour : now and 
then they paused to ease their throb- 
bing bosoms, then panting with ire 
and renovated vigour, flew on each 
other. They wrestled — every nerve was 
strained in the arduous contest— none 
dare name the victor — one relreated, 
while the other pressed — his lordship 
sprung into the valley, and instantly 
exclaimed, 'they are on the bridge —

paused, he w^as too much interested 
to speak further of the warriors ; one of 
whom was light and active, the other 
Herculean strong: ; he that excelled 
in vi.?our, aimed at the bosom of 
his rival a desperate blow, but the 
other, quick as the bounding Antelope, 
stept aside, and fortunately avoided 
his messenger of death; then, with

■wily cunning, placed bis foot before 
his heavy foe, and precipitated him 
headlong', down into the g-apin^- 
gulpli. The victor, like the long- 
necked heron, bent his body forward 
to view the ruin he had made, then 
doifing- his cap, gracefully fell on one 
knee, and raising his glittering hazel- 
coloured eyes towards heaven, silently 
returned thanks to that Almighty 
Power who had saved him from like 
destruction. 

While the fight raged with such 
well-contested skill on the part of 
each combatant, the ladies silently 
waited the event ; but when the van- 
quished Aubert whirled into the rocky 
abyss, their piercing shrieks instantly 
excited the attention of the noble 
victor. He heard, saw, and hastened 
towards them ; in a moment he ap- 
peared, and though flushed with con- 
quest, was much exhausted. On ob- 
serving the ladies, he sheathed his 
bloody sabre, and advanced with a 



204 ALEXENA; OR THE 

light and graceful step ; when within a 
few paces^ Arabel screamed, and dart- 
ing from her horse, flew to meet the 
handsome stranger ; he started back, 
but having gazed an instant, flung his 
cap to the ground, and clasped her to his 
heart. Oh ! Moiitogomeri ! — My dearest 
Arabel! — announced the meeting of 
these happy lovers ; she softly struggled 
to free herself from his embrace, while he 
folded her again and again to his bosom. 
The troopers capered with joy, and the 
servants, by their extravagant gestures, 
seemed stark mad — so much were the 
poor fellows delighted at the happy 
and unexpected meeting between the 
beauteous Arabel and her victorious 
Theodore.

HE solemn duskiness of evening 
had fallen on the mountains, before 
they were able to reach a shelter; but 
at length arrived, without accident, 
before the gates of the ruin of an old 
castle, that had long been converted 
into a house of entertainment for the 
accommodation of travellers, who had 
gold to pay for the scanty meal that 
they were often obliged to be satisfied 
with. 

Before they were admitted, Bernardo 
amused them by pointins^ out what had 
constituted the strength of the castle.

of wLich nothing then remained but 
mouldering- ^vallp^, and half shattered 
ramparts. The gateway was defended 
by towers, united by a part of a curtain, 
(the remainder had long before fallen,) 
and underneath it stood the massive 
gates, at the wreck of which, the 
guards knocked so loud, that the noise 
rebounded off the distant rocks. In a 
few minutes, the host and a few of his 
ragged attendants forced back the 
portal folds, and they then passed the 
fallen draw-bridge, through the first, 
into what had been the second court. 
When the ladies dismounted, the 
landlord led the way through an exten- 
sive hall, supported by a vast number of 
arches, into a chamber rendered com- 
fortable by an excellent bright wood 
fire. The furniture was in good pre- 
servation, though ancient, and the floor 
was covered with a warm carpet, that 
rendered the room cheerful. While 
the females crowded round the fire, all 
was confusion in -the court-yard. The 
lord of the mansion stood rubbing his

hands with joy, at the arrival of so 
much company, and left the manage- 
ment of every thin^^ to his servants, 
vi^ho were quarreling- with the troopers 
about the stables, which were damp, 
and, in many places, unroofed, hord 
Mortimer was at length obliged to 
interfere, when the host arranged every- 
thing satisfactorily, hi/ puttmg the 
horses to heel in the front drawing-room 
of the castle. Thus harmony was re- 
stored, and the supper being shortly 
after announced, every individual was 
in good humour. The gamiC of the 
mountains was excellent, and fortu- 
nately the landlord had abundance of 
it, on which they feasted most delici- 
ously. Soon after supper, the ladies 
expressed an earnest wish to hear what 
had occasioned the combat on the 
bridge ; Theodore instantly offered to 
gratify their curiosity, and when they 
had drawn their chairs close to his, he

ceived I was the happiest of mortals. 
My father had a chateau, situated on 
the banks of the Seine, in one of the 
most delightful situations imaginable, 
and there my family generally passed 
the summer months. We had the ad- 
vantage of a most agreeable neigiibour- 
hood, and among the many whose 
society we enjoyed, the father of Arabel 
was my father's most distinguished 
friend ; his residence stood on the op- 
posite side of the river, sheltered by 
woods, where I often rambled, accom- 
panied by his daughter, to listen to the 
trembling of the leaves at intervals in 
the breeze, or to observe the stars, as 
they were reflected on the dark mirror 
of the waters. We were betrothed to 
each other, by the mutual consent of our 
parents, and to our own inexpressible 
happiness; therefore, partook of every 
amusement together, without exciting 
the breath of calumny. Frequently in 
thoso rambles, Arabel brought her lute, 
and as we enjoyed the sweet scent of

evening, she touched the chords with 
the finger of harmony, and accompa-

good old man a sketch of our innocent 
excursion. Thus happily passed the days 
of our early courtship, and often since 
I have re-traced them with a sii?h of 
regret. Within a few miles oC these be- 
loved scenes of my childhood, stood the 
splendid edifice of tlie Count Macare, 
a man, reserved and haughty ; of a cruel 
and suspicious temper ; cunning and 
unsearchable in contrivance; patient 
and indefatigable in the execution of

his villainous intentions, when once 
conceived and determined on; he had 
perfect command of his passions, which 
were chiefly pride, lust, voluptuousness, 
revenge, and avarice ; and this last was 
the most predominant feature of his 
character — his origin was mean, and 
he owed his power and influence to his 
activity, in obliging the mother of. 
Francis, the late queen dowager, who 
so grossly abused it. When liis late 
majesty was in confinement after the 
battle of Pavia, he was one of those 
■«ho advised him to agree to dishonor- 
able terms, to regain his liberty, and-i 
after his return, said, Francis would de- 
serve to be a prisoner for ever, if he 
performed a single article of the treaty 
which he had signed. His majesty un- 
fortunately took his advice, and in- 
volved the kingdom in the recent wars, 
by which so much blood and treasure 
have been lavished; but it is to be 
hoped, the virtues of his son. King 
Henry, will compensate for the indis- 
cretion of his father.

Pardon this digression^ as it was ne- 
€essaryto point out the means by which 
the infamous Macare became possessed 
of wealth and title. The count w^as a 
bachelor, but had a nephew, with 
whom I was educated at Paris; he was 
a gay, impetuous, and extravagant 
youth, but brave and generous, until 
corrupted by vicious example; his 
person was handsome, though rather 
robust; his manners fascinating, and 
he it was whose melancholy fate you 
have this day witnessed." 

When Theodore had proceeded thus 
far, Arabel was greatly shocked at the 
death of the unfortunate young man, 
though he was one of the principal 
wretches who almost persecuted her to 
the very jaws of death; but being 
once an intimate acquaintance, she 
could not help feeling for his miserable 
exit, particularly as she felt convinced, 
however innocent, she was the cause of 
his untimely end, and therefore retired 
to her chamber, not wishing to hear

Theodore continued his narrative thus: 

" I often invited young Aubert to my

intimacy between his uncle and my 
parent, and shortly after, to an intro- 
duction to the family of M. Santanelle. 
When Arabel had attained her four-

extremely distressing to her, his com- 
pliments were equally fulsome, and the 
consequence was, my dislike, in a short

distant. 1 conceited this short time an 
age, and had almost iai mediate reason 
for real unhappiness; for as I had 
foreseen, it happened — Count Macare 
demanded the hand of Arabel, and 
was peremptorily refused ; the conse- 
quence was, he left her father's house, 
breathing; revenge, and returned to 
Paris with all possible expedition, when 
M. Santanelle, to prevent a renewal of 
his preposterous suit, resolved on seeing 
us instantly married, but his designs 
were frustrated by the villainy of the 
count. That'niiiiit he was arrested, 
by virtue of a royal warrant, and con- 
veyed to the dungeons of the Bastile, 
where he suffered every privation and 
indignity, that the malice or brutal re- 
venge of IMacare could inflict; being" 
accused of co-operating in the }}lans 
of the Emperor of Germany, he was 
treated with the severity due to a 
traitor. 

*' Arabel^ from the moment of his ar- 



214 alesena; ok the 

rest, became the most wretched of hu- 
man beino'S^ and had it not been for 
the attentions of my father, would have 
eventually expired for want of nourish- 
ment and repose. Shortly after M. 
Santanelle's arrest, I set out fcr Paris, 
where, with considerable difnculty, I 
was admitted to see my much-respected 
friend ; he was confined in a lonely 
damp cell; the furniture of which con- 
sisted of a small worm-eaten table, 
while the faint glimmering of a soli- 
tary lamp served to shew its narrow 
boundaries, occupied with a small por- 
tion of half-rotten straw, and the re- 
mains of a pitcher, which contained 
a little stagnant water. I could only 
deplore his misery — to relieve it, was 
not in my power; the only favour I 
could procure, was liberty for him to 
write a letter to his daughter, subject 
to the inspection of the governor, 
which he did, and in it commanded 
her, as she valued his peace, instantly 
to bestow her hand on me; then con- 
cluded by saying he was unconscious 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 215 

of crime, and felt convinced, the jus- 
tice of his sovereign would speedily 
release him. 1 returned with all pos- 
sible haste, with this letter, and a few 
moments after I delivered it, there was 
another put into Arabel's hands, by 
a courier from the Count Macare, in 
which he offered to release her father, 
if she consented to bestow her hand 
on his nephew Aubert. This renewed 
her distress, and in the most deplorable 
state of agony, she resolved instantly 
to proceed to Paris, and if every other 
alternative failed, nobly determined to 
sacrifice her future happiness, to insure 
the safety of her parent. She, however, 
was not allowed to execute this pious 
design, for in two hours after Macare's 
messenger had departed, (without an 
answer,) she was seized by a band of 
ruffians, who carried her off, having first 
placed a strong guard on every pass 
to my father's house — (he scene of 
their outrage; yet notwithstanding 
their vigilance, 1 contrived to effect my 
escape, and proceeded on foot towards 



^16 alexena; or the 

Paris, in a state little short of distrac* 
tion. I travelled uiitii dawn, and then 
lay concealed in a village adjacent to 
the road, until the sun's rays were no 
longer visible, and then pursued my 
journey. It was about three o'clock 
in the morning, and yet very dark, 
when 1 reached the suburbs ; so 
much so, that I could scarce discern 
the way ; the clouds appeared charged 
with thunder, as they moved rapidly 
along the heavens, revealing, at inter- 
vals, tlie trembling stars; and in a short 
time I entered a wood that surrounded 
the country villa of the count. The 
thunder growled hoarsely at a distance, 
and the lightnings played faintly round, 
frequently, though partially, revealing 
the deep recesses of the groves, or, for 
an instant, illumined them with a glare 
of fiery splendour; and while I wan- 
dered on, the moon, at intervals, cast a 
glimmering light through the dark 
foliage, as she struggled with the black 
clouds, which contended to obscure her 
brilliancy. The path which I pursued. 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 217 

led directly to the chateau, and com- 
municated with several others, which 
wound through the groves in various 
directions; in one of these, parallel with 
that in which I was, the lightning re- 
vealed the figure of a female, dressed in 
white robes, which waved in the wind. 
The thunder, whose deep volley was 
lately heard afar, at this moment burst 
with a tremendous crash over the place 
on which I then remained immovable^, 
and undetermined how to proceed. 
Between the boles of the trees, the blue 
and angry fires quivered, and swept the 
surrounding boughs, which, with the 
distant mansion, appeared clothed in 
livid flame ; another and another flash 
blazed round the figure, which rapidly 
approached, and 1 then felt convinced 
I saw the wandering perturbed spirit of 
some ill-fated mortal ; I tried to speak, 
but my tongue refused utterance ; I 
murmured something, and leant against 
a tree for support. The pitchy dark- 
ness excluded further view, until a 
lengthened flash crossed the path, and

discovered us as we almost touched 
each other ; — a wild scream announced 
the woman, as she sunk senseless to 
the earth. Poor, helpless female! I 
exclaimed, as I raised her, what cru- 
elty has exposed you to the rigorous 
inclemency of this night? she answer- 
ed not; her delicate frame was con- 
vulsed, and I was oblised to hold her 
tight to my bosom. Again, the light- 
ning hissed through the rain, which 
fell in torrents, and discovered, to my 
inexpressible anguish, that it was the 
almost lifeless form of Arabel that I 
strained in my embrace. 

*' The murmur of many voices now 
sighed on the breeze, and lights moved 
round the chateau, which were the 
torches of the count's attendants, who 
were in pursuit of his wretched fu- 
gitive. As they approached, the red 
glare of light rendered their figures

the distant trees : fear, and the anxious 
hope of escape, lent nie renovated

strength, and having lifted my hjvely 
burden on my shoulders, hastened 
through the woods I knew not whither, 
and after considerable fatigue, arrived 
,at a cottage about a quarter of a mile 
from it, where, being quite exhaust- 
ed, I was obliged to convey Arabel. 
Her garments were drenched throuoh 
with rain, and the wind havini; carried 
away her hat, her hair hung in wet and 
matted tresses about her shoulders, 
the coldness of the night had stiffened 
her limbs, and the only comfort I could 
procure for her in that miserable place, 
was a fire, at which the cottager's wife 
chaffed her frozen figure, and, with dif- 
ficulty, restored animation. When as- 
sured of her safety, she grew composed, 
and the moment her weary eyes were 
closed in a deep sleep, I flew towards 
Paris to procure proper refreshments, 
and to despatch a messenger to my 
father, with the joyful tidings of my 
success, and then returned to Arabel, 
who was much better from the repose 

she had enjoyed.

" In that poor cottage, we were maf" 
ried the next day bnt one, in presence 
of my parent, and in compliance with 
a second earnest letter of intreaty from 
]M. Santanelle; but the fleeting; mo- 
ments of my felicity were short, for in 
half an hour after the ceremony, I was 
arrested, and conveyed to a prison, and 
have not since beheld Arabel, until we 
so fortunately met in the mountain. 

" My gaoler, the second month of my 
confinement, inliniated I was only taken 
up on suspicion, and if there were not 
absolute proofs of mv guilt before the

I instantly conceived Count Macare 
had me detained, for the purpose of 
depriving Arabel of my assistance, and 
remained tortured with the most racking 
pains of suspense, pacing up and down 
my dungeon, lamenting the cruel des- 
tiny that had been the cause of my 
introduction to young Aubert, or his 
infamous uncle. Thus I passed (he four

without any cause beiiit^ assigned, and 
ordered to quit Paris within two hours, 
on pain of perpetual banishment. 

" The first use I made of my reco- 
vered liberty was, to hasten to (lie Bas- 
tile, to inquire for M. Santanelle, but 
could neither obtain access to, nor any 
information concernhii^ him, and as I 
was' refracitig my way back to the cot- 
tage, where I had been so cruelly torn 
from Arabel, I met an old soldier, who 
was formerly a domestic of my father's, 
and to wiiom, when a boy, 1 had been 
much attached ; the veteran saluted me 
as 1 passed, and I instantly recognised 
him, and inquired after his welfare. " I 
have," said he, " been seeking you these 
three days past, that I might commu- 
nicate some particulars about the fate 
of Mademoiselle Santanelle, who is at 
present in the power of Count Macare. 
Please follow me to the dark shade of 
yonder piazza, where we wilj be se- 
cure frohi observation, and I shall let 
you know the particulars." On reach-

ing the spot^ he continued, " IMy sister 
Jeanette is in the service of Count 
Macare, and through lier I have ob- 
tained some information relative to 
you. which is briefly this: — the mo- 
ment you were arrested, and securely 
lodged in prison, the emissaries of the 
count seized Mademoiselle Santanelle, 
and conducted her back to his chateau; 
on their arrival, they carried her into 
the saloon, from which she first con- 
trived to escape. The count was 
already there, and for some time 
regarded her with a look of scorn, 
mingled with malicious joy, at having 
lier again in his power; then insulted 
the dear young lady with a formal 
declnration of his passion, and said, 
as he had been contemptuously treat- 
ed by a former refusal, he v\as re- 
solved to compel her to accept his 
liand, or bury her in the seclusion 
of a convent for life. Mademoiselle 
Arabel answered him with much spi- 
rit, declaring she would rather perish 
than become his wife^ alleging she 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 223 

was already married. Thus ihe lirst 
ten days passed — tlie count continu- 
ally persecuting her; one day alleg- 
ing you were dead — the next, that 
you should be released from prison, if 
she should consent to bestow her hand. 
At length he told her, he resigned all 
hopes in favour of his nephew Aubert, 
who, he commanded her to receive 
as her future husband. This young 
man became latterly one of the most 
dissipated youths in Paris, and being 
<?areless how he procured money, 
squandered vast sums, until he jifound 
himself deeply embarrassed, and con- 
sequently entered with avidity into 
his uncle's plans, for seizing the for- 
tune of M. Santanelle. He also made 
a declaration of pretended love to 
Mademoiselle Arabel, and met with 
the same success; but his infamous 
uncle sent for a priest, devoted to 
his purposes, and in defiance of the 
young lady's tears, screams, and in- 
treaties, the ceremony was performed ; 
Aubcrt answering the responses. A 



^4 alexena; or the 

iTiarriage contract was drawn up, and 
the count held Mademoiselle Arabers 
Jiand until her signature was written 
to it; this was done in the presence of 
some of his domestics, on whom he 
could depend. One of them, named 
Roberto, is my sister's lover, and im- 
parted this to her, under promise of 
the most inviolable secrecy. Instantly 
after this sham ceremony. Mademoi- 
selle Santanelle fell into strong con- 
vulsions, and for many days her life 
was despaired of; but as soon as she 
was able to move about her apart- 
ment, the count determined to carry 
lier to a convent in Spain, and confine 
her for life. It is said her father is dead, 
and that by virtue of the marriage con- 
tract, which has been already proved, 
young- Aubert is in the peaceable en- 
joyment of the entire of his immense 
possessions. A few days ago, he in- 
formed his vassals he was about 
to accompany his wife into Spain, 
for the benefit of her health, and 
has actually set out, attended by 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 225 

the count and Mademoiselle Santa- 
iielle. for the purpose, Roberto says, 
of gettin^^ rid of her for ever/' " My 
dear young master/' continued Launce- 
lot, " 1 could not learn the name of 
(he convent, but I trust they have not 
yet reached the Spanish side of the 
Pyrennees, and if you take proper pre- 
cautions, you may not yet be too late 
t-o save your Arabel. 

"Judge the agony of my soul, when 
I heard tins recital ; I almost flew to 
Harfleur, where my disconsolate parent 
furnished me with money, horses, do- 
mestics, and every necessary, and early 
next morning I was on the road to 
Spain, and had arrived thus far, when, 
in ascending the neighbouring moun- 
tain, I met Aubert, accompanied by a 
single domestic. In a moment we re- 
cognized each<)ther, and it is unneces- 
sary to say, we itistantly commenced 
that combat, which has terminated th'e 
existence of my detested foe; and

further particulars,, as I am utterly 
unacquainted with the means by which 
she contrived to escape from the mer- 
ciless count ; but conceive she is in- 
debted for her safety, to your kind- 
ness." 

Here Theodore paused, and Arabel^ 
who had recovered from her slight 
indisposition, resumed the sequel of 
their story: — 

"She had been conveyed to thecount^s 
chateau, on the night her father was 
dragged to the dungeons of the Bastile, 
and insulted by the count, who made 
many professions of love, and unalter- 
able aflbction ; but at length he pro- 
ceeded to rudeness, and after a severe 
struggle, she escaped from his grasp, 
into a green-house adjoining the room, 
one oi" the wiiidows of which being 
open, she leaped from it into the wood,, 
unconscious of itsheijrht.and re<i^ardless 
of every danger, except that of bein^ 
retaken by the count ; in her fligh!| 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 227 

Jihe fortunately met Theodore, who con- 
veyed her ahnost lifeless to the cottage, 
where they were married in a few days 
after. 

*' When she became the count's cap- 
tive a second time, he treated her with 
the utmost brutality, and after the ini- 
quitous ceremony had been performed, 
(mentioned by Launcelot,) he resolved 
to sacrifice her to his safety, and that 
of his nephew. Instigated by revenge, 
avarice, and diabolical cruelty, he con- 
veyed her to the convent of Domini- 
cans — that infamous receptacle, where 
the most wanton and savage crimes 
and cruelties were daily perpetrated, 
under the mask of religion, and where 
the abbess and the count beino; old 
friends, soon came to an understand- 
ing. Arabel, as usuni, was tried as an 
apostate nun, and in less than a month 
after his departure, was condemned to 
terminate her wretched existence in 
that horrid den of carnage, from whicli 
she was rescued by Bernardo and Lord 
Mortimer."

Philips. 

Wll E N Arabel and Theodore haf! 
concluded, Evelene resumed the sub- 
ject, and gave her attentive auditors, a 
detail of the events that led to her cod- 
fiuemnent in the cell of the convent. 

She was the daughter of a rich mer- 
chant, of Cordova, who was both proud 
and ambitious; as he had_, by industry, 
amassed great wealth, he wished to 
enoble his family by some splendid 
alliance, and, thus influenced, he left 
the place of his nativity, and went to 
reside at Madiid, where he hoped to 
bury the remembrance of his past life, 
and the name of merchant, in eternal 
oblivion. Conscious he wordd not be 
able to form an alliance with any noble 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 229 

family that were equally wealthy, he 
souirht those to whom his riches would 
be an object, and soon found Don 
Vitelli, a cavalier descended from the 
ancient Hidalgo; but, by thoughtless 
eictravagance, considerably embarrassed 
in his pecuniary engagements. They 
became acquainted, and in a very few 
months, were on such terms of intimacy, 
as promised the speedy completion of 
Siffnior Pedro's wishes : but the heart 
of Evelene had not been consulted on 
this important occasion, nor was she 
acquainted with her father's intentions, 
until he commanded her to consider 
Don Vitelli as her future husband. 
She was shocked, and overwhelmed 
with ffrief and consternation at this 
cruel command, as her heart had been^ 
prior to this event, engaged to Antonio,, 
the brother of Alexena, who she had 
been intimately acquainted with, while 
in Cordova with his regiment. Some 
months after his introduction, he made 
a declaration of his passion, and was 
favourably received. Overjoyed at his 



SSO ALEXENA; CttTIIE 

good fortune, he rashly proposed the 
affair to Signior Pedro, who refused his 
consent, because he was a younger 
brother, without title ; and to prevent 
all further intercourse between the 
lovers, instantly set out for Madrid, 
leaving Antonio the most wretched of 
human beings. Evelene, however, was 
constant, and neither threats or en- 
treaties, could prevail on her to consent 
to marry Vitelli ; not that she enter- 
tained any dislike to his person, but 
because she nobly resolved never to 
give her hand without her heart, and 
the latter was not at her disposal. 

About this period, Don Vitelli had 
given offence to the Holy Tribunal, by 
some heretical opinions, he very un- 
advisedly gave, in some affairs of par- 
ticular consequence, which brought him 
under their heavy displeasure, and an 
order was issued for his arrest. Signior 
Pedro heard of the circumstance, and 
instantly waited on the Vicai* General, 
his most particular friend, to whom h« 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO, 231 

unburtheiied his distressed heart, and 
earnestly implored mercy for Vitelli^, 
and the Vicar's influence Avith his 
disobedient daughter. Both requests 
were granted, and his friend promised to 
seize Vitelli and Evelene, and have 
them immediately married. 'I will 
* have your girl accused/ said he, ' of 
' imbibing Vitelli's heresy, and give 
' her the choice of marriage, or the 
'^ stake ; fears of a death of tortures, 
' will speedily overcome her pretended 
' aversion, and I will impress on Vitelli 
' the idea, that his marriage with 
' your daughter, saved him from the 
' effects of our most dreaded wrath.' 
Siirnior Pedro was delighted with this 
arrangement, and as a testimonial of 
his satisfaction, fell on his knee, and 
placed a brilliant of immense value 
on the finger of the crafty incpiisitor, 
who knew as well hov/ to estimate, as 
to distribute his favours. This scheme 
was, however, frustrated by the poinard 
of the assassin Scalto, who killed the 
tiiifortunate Vitelli, when his dagger 



f J2 ALEXENA ; OR THE 

and the blow, were intended for the 
bosom of Lord Mortimer. 

This accounts for Evelene's appear- 
ance before the tribunal, and her in- 
troduction to his lordship. 

Signior Pedro was excessively grieved 
by the untimely death of his intended 
son-in-law, and Evelene, for the pre- 
sent, relieved from persecution ; but in 
the course of two months, a new suitor 
renewed her sorrows. Leopold, Coiuit 
Baretto, a profligate Italian noble, had 
the address to gain the good will of 
her father, and soon made her a tender 
of his hand and heart. Fortune, he 
had none; the Cassino's of Italy, and 
their gaming tables, had swallowed 
every ducat, long before his arrival in 
Spain. His connexion, however, was 
unexceptionable, and among others, 
the abbess of the Dominican convent 
was one, whose power and riches made 
no contemptible fiofurc ; she was his 
miut, and if there vras a possibility she 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 233 

liad affection for any object on earth, 
Leopold was the favoured mortal. He 
was to be, with the institution of which 
she was the cruel superior, joint heir 
to all her immense wealth, and there- 
fore looked forward to a marriao;-e of 
convenience, until the expiration of 
that much desired event. 

Evelene was every way interesting- ; 
she possessed both beauty, fortune, 
and every accomplishment necessary for 
an elegant female ; he, therefore, re- 
solved to make her a countess, but with- 
out once consulting her inclinations, 
and as soon as he could, with dis- 
cretion, proposed for her in due form. 
Most unfortunately for Evelene, he 
obtained her father's consent, and she 
was a second time commanded to pre- 
pare to receive a husband whom she 
detested. The sudden death of Signior 
Pedro, however, released her from this 
engagement, and left her mistress of 
her hand, and a large fortune. 



SS4 alexena; or the 

Though her father was the most 
arbitrary of mankind, yet she mourned 
him with sincere atfection, and shorty 
after his interment, retired to a small 
country seat, a few miles from Madrid, 
where she might indulge her feelings, 
free from the intrusions of the unfeelins: 
or impertinent. But even this sacred 
retreat was unable to protect her from 
llie assiduous, though detested Leopold, 
and his visits at length became so fre- 
quent and troublesome, that Evelene 
dismissed him wilh the most solemn 
assurance, that she never would consent 
to be his wife. 

The count departed, convinced he 
had nothing to hope, but determined to 
use stratasrem to effect his wishes, and 
marry her by force. Having once con- 
ceived the design, he resolved to carry 
it into immediate execution. Every 
thing was to be apprehended from de- 
lay ; and Antonio, her favoured lover, 
might return and defeat his plans. It 
was necessary to be assisted by some 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARGO. 235 

powerful fiiencl^ and who more likely 
to forward his views than his aunt, 
the Dominican abbess ; to her he in- 
stantly applied, and Mas most cordially- 
received. Every thin«^ was arranged 
that could ensure success, and a few- 
days after, Evelene was a prisoner 
within the convent's gloomy walls. 

It would be a tedious task to detail 
her sufferinijs. or to follow her throuii^h 
the scenes of misery and insult, which 
she suffered in that abode of sorrow ; 
let it suffice, that the abbess made use 
of every threat, as well as every per- 
suasion, to induce her to become the 
Coimtess de Baretto, but in vain. 
Leopold, at length, infuriated at his 
rejected suit, resolved to make her sue 
for that title, which she had hitherto 
refused, by violating every law, human 
aufl divine. The abbess consented to 
this diabolical arrangement, as Evelene 
was instantly aRer to become his bride, 
and appointed a lonely chamber, in a 
distant gallery, where her cries and 



256 ALEXENA ; OR THE 

entreaties would be vain; there she 
was ordcredj unconscious of the medi- 
tated attempt, and had scarcely entered 
the room, till Leopold fastened the 
door, and once again, offered himself 
to her acceptance. The unfortunate 
Evelene had a fatal presentiment of 
his infamous intentions, and tried to 
effect her escape, but found that an 
utter impossibility. She then pretended 
compliance^ but he was aware that it 
was her fears, and not her inclination, 
that answered him. However, resolved 
to put her to the proof, he told her 
there wiis a monk in the adjoinins: 
chamber, who would that instant unite 
them. The feelino:s of Evelene were 
now wound up to the agony of despe- 
ration, and she refused, with the ut- 
most firnuiess of voice, and upbraided 
Leopold, for his unmanly and savage 
conduct. This was the siirnal for 
iniquity; he seized her panting and 
agitated form in his arms, and en- 
deavoured to force her down on a 
-fopha. The die was cast — he set his 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 237 

soul upon the throw — and drowned 
her prayers and her screama with the 
blasphemous expressions of exulting 
villainy. Her little strength was almost 
exhausted ; no help, no assistance nigh; 
she called on God to aid^ to rescue her, 
from the grasp of a ruffian monster. 
The count mocked her, by saying, ' his 
majesty was too far off, and too busily\ 
engaged to attend: besides,' he con- 
tinued, * he never looks towards this 
blessed receptacle of puri'y,' Evelene 
had sunk on her knees, and despair 
had dravYn his last dark fold round her, 
when she obseiTed the glittering hilt of 
the count's stiletto; she seized it, and 
then summoning the last particles of 
her expiring strciigth, sheathed it in 
the side of the almost trium.phant 
Leopold. lie groaned — and fell; — the 
thick mists of death rapidly advanced, 
to close his career for ever. Evelene 
stood over him, transfixed with horror; 
footsteps advanced along the gallery ; 
the door was flung open, and the abbess, 
attended by several nuns^ entered the 



233 alexexa; or the 

chaiTiber. It had been precoiiceited; 
that she should discover Evelene and 
her nephew together, and then, death or 
marriage would be inevitable. Con- 
ceive her consternation, on beholding 
him writhing in agony, and welter- 
ing in his blood ; he could yet speak, 
and his last words were, in entreating 
Evelene's forgiveness, and beseeching 
his annt not to avenge his death 
on the innocent cause of it. ' I 
have deserved my fate,' said he, ' but 
I jet hope there may be mercy.' 
Surgical aid was instantly summoned^ 
and one of the father^s to administer the 
last consolations of religion; the latter 
was in time — but all the povvcrs of 
medicine and surgery were vain ; the 
deadly point was envenomed, ajtd the 
consequence was instant mortification. 
Lcojiold expired in two hours after he 
had received the awful rights of the 
chu;ch, and the fo!i;iveness of the al- 
most distracted Evelene. 

The grief of the abbess was extreme^ 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 239 

a« slie kept her chamber many weeks ; 
but then issued forth, full of cruelty 
and deadly vengeance, which she re- 
solved to let the luckless Evelene feel, 
and every other victim subject to her 
power. The last request of her nephew 
was disregarded, and she resolved to 
inflict the most cruel torments on her 
who had been the cause of his death. 

The horror of having deprived a 
human being of life, though under 
such circumstances of dire necessity, 
inflicted a terrible punishment on the 
susceptible mind of the lovely mourn- 
er ; but the abbess was resolved she 
should perish by lingering torments. 
The fatal day was appointed, and she 
had the form of a trial. To deny that 
the count died by her hand, wass as 
vain as to recite the cause ; her sen- 
tence was speedily pronounced, and 
the next ni^ht, she and Arabel were 
consigned, with all the usual ceremo- 
nies, to that mansion of misery, from 
which they were rescued by Bernardo. 



340 ALEXENA ; OR THE 

When Evelene concluded, she was 
charmed to find the near affinity that 
subsisted between Alexena and her 
lover ; and Lord Mortimer felt rejoiced 
at Antonio's good fortune, as he had 
heard much of his transcendent virtues, 
and was delighted that his Alexena 
had, at least, one worthy relative. 

The night was far spent before our 
weary travellers sought repose ; but 
fortunately had the satisfaction of find- 
ing well-aired beds, in which they en- 
joyed all the balmy comfort of refresh- 
ing sleep, and awoke the following day 
with renovated vigour, and in high 
spirits, anxious to pursue theirjournev.

"Eye me, bless'd Providence, and square my trial 
To my proportioned strength." 

Milton. 

W H I L E at breakfast, the report of 
fire arms in the court-yard alarmed 
Lord Mortimer and his friends, and the 
former, attended by Bernardo, rushed 
out, to ascertain the cause, when thev 
found the Biscay troopers re-loading 
their carbines, and arranging their 
ammunition with particular care, ac- 
companied by many significant nods 
to each other. His lordship having 
observed them, requested to know the 
meaning of this unwonted caution, and 
was answered by tlie troopers, that a 
few leagues farther they would be 
obliged to pass one of the favourite 
haunts of Beizo Carracci, a notorious 
captain of the most merciless banditti 
that ever infested the wilds of the Pyren- 
ti ees, or the Spanish doniinions. '* You 
^vould do wellj my lord/' said one o^

them, '' to hasten the departure of jour 
friends, that we may pass the mountain 
in safety; for though Carracci himself 
is not fond of attacking females, if the 
command is entrusted to any of the 
subordinate officers of the gang, thejr 
will shew little, if any mercy, and he 
seldom accompanies them on petty 
excursions." Bernardo observed, "the 
bandit me'ationed, was the most dreaded 
robber that had ev€r existed ;" and 
pressed Lord Mortimer to make the 
least possible delay. Half an hour was 
therefore scarcely allowed for break- 
fast, &c. ere they were once more 
clambering over the pyramidical steeps 
of those wilds. 

As they proceeded among the heights, 
the gloom of the surrounding objects 
struck the fancy with horror, and 
served to increase the terror and gloomy 
forebodinirs that the name of Carracci 
had awakened. Rocks, grey and bar- 
ren, piled on each other, until they 
formed stnpendcus walls, stood as 



0AST1.E OF SANTA MARCO. 243 

Isoundariesiothe narrow glens, through 
which scanty patches of shrubs strug- 
gled for freedom, while their roots 
sought shelter in the shallow crannies 
of the precipices. 

In two hours they were on a spot 
that overlooked the dreaded haunts of 
the robber, which were by no means in 
unison with his character ; as plan- 
tations of olives, palms, and almonds, 
together with the gayest hues that can 
be awakened into life, were beautifully 
intermingled with most luxuriant culti- 
vation ; while the ripe fruit glowing 
among the foliage, perfumed the air, 
as the clouds floated silently along 
the blue concave, forming themselves 
into innumerable fantastical shapes and 
airy forms — now seen — then lost the 
next instant. 

They descended into those lovely 
Vallies, without injury, and the terrors 
of Carracci's name would have seem- 
ed solely seated in the brains of the

214 ALESENA ; on THE 

Biscayans, had they not now and then 
encountered the mouldering- skeleton of 
those who had served him, and whose 
bones rattled in the blast, as they 
hung dangling from the height of 
some frightful precipice, that cast its 
long shadows across the road. 

About six o'clock in the evening, 
they arrived at a woody deule, throngli 
"which it was absolutely necessary thr^y 
should pass, and had not proceeded 
far beneath the gloom of its shades, 
before they heard the moans of some 
person in distress. Compassion was 
one of those Christian virtues which 
Tvarmed the bosom of Lord Moriimer* 
and being then actuated by those feelings 
which prompted him to relieve the 
wretched, he sprung from his horse, 
and hastily entered the wood, a little to 
the right of the road, where he found a 
cavalier lying vionnded and bloody, 
with two of his faithful domesticsi 
stretched lifeless beside him. His 
lordssliip instantly called on BcrnarxJo 



CASTLE OF SANTA MAUCO. 215 

for assistance, and between them, they 
carried the wounded stranger to the 
road, having resolved to remove him 
to the adjacent village, where there 
was a possibility surgical assistance 
might be procured ; but imagine their 
consternation and surprise, on finding 
that the dying cavalier was the bro- 
tlier of Alexena, and lover of Evelene. 
The cries of his distressed sister 
awakened him to life, while joy, at once 
again beholding the latter, revived 
him, tliou^li his wounds were man\r 
and he was greatly exhausted by loss 
of blood ; yet, assisted by a good 
constitution, and matchless care, little 
tk)ubts were entertained of his recovery 
when they reached Bayonne, where 
they arrived about two days after. 

Bayonne had many allurements to 
induce Lord Mortimer to remain some 
time, and there Alexena consented 
to be led a second lime to the hyme- 
neal altar. Antonio, who was ra- 
pidly recovering, under the care of his 



ici6 alexeka; or the 

assiduous nurses^ was blessed with the 
assurance of Eveler.e's unalterable at- 
tachriientj and had obtained a promise 
of her hand, as soon as he should be 
able to enjoy the blessing. Thus 
every thing promised a speedy ter- 
mination of all their hardships, as 
Theodore, assisted by the influence of 
a favourite minister, was likely to ob- 
tain possession of the property of M. 
Sanrtanelle, in right of his wife, and the 
treacherous Count Macare was already 
imprisoned in the dungeons of the 
Eastile. Things were in this favour- 
able train ; the day was appointed for his 
lordship's marriage; Evelene was al- 
ready the wife of her beloved Antonio ; 
and all their friends happy, when the 
unexpected appearance of Montano 
gave birth to the most unpleasant and 
alarming sensations. 

Lord Mortimer beins: a stranjrer toi 
the laws and customs of France, knew 
not how to act; his enemy, he found 
on inquiry, was chaplain^ and under 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 247 

the immediate protection of a Portu- 
guese noble, who was notorious for his 
immense wealth, and for the infamy by 
which he had amassed it. 

Don Philip Acasto, this new friend of 
Montano, was a villain from early habit, 
and neglected education; he had been 
an only son, and heir to immense riches^ 
surrounded by minions and parasites, 
who flattered his every wish from the 
early dawning of reason, and led him 
to believe the world was created for his 
enjoyment. Thus nurtured in sloth- 
ful indulgence, with every wish gratified 
as soon as conceived ; he was impati- 
ent under the slightest controul, or most 
tritling disappointment, and in a short 
time became a burthen to himself, and 
an object of terror to his dependants, 
As he had not the stay of education to 
support him, his mind was a dreary 
blank, and to fill up the worthless va- 
cuity, had recourse to gaming, to which 
he devoted his entire time ; and never 
leeling any of*' the compunctious visit- 



^48 alexena; or tre 



ings of nature/' cheated, whenever he 
Gould do so with impunity. 

Among the passions that influenced 
this worthless man, sensual love was 
not the least ungovernable, and it was 
rumoured there was a residence of his 
in the most savage and dreary wilds of 
the Pyrennees, where he had long been 
accustomed to sacrifice the luckless 
victims of his lust, yet much uncer- 
tainty existed as to its exact situation ; 
but it was known to have been, in past 
ages, the noble mansion of the Santa 
Marco family; won by the present pos- 
sessor from one of its late descendants, 
who was shortly after found murdered, 
and under such circumstances, as fixed 
a suspicion, that Don Philip was the 
diabolical perpetrator of the inhuman 
deed ; particularly, as the beautiful sis- 
ter of the deceased Don Miguel de 
St. Marco disappeared some time after, 
and her husband, Don Selib, was said 
to have shared his brother-in-law's 
hapless fate. 



CASTLE OP SANTA MARCO. f49 

When Lord Mortimer learned those 
particulars, he carefully shunned all 
possibility of an introduction to Don 
Philip, and Alexena remained a close 
prisoner in her hotel, lest some new 
misfortune should once again place her 
in the power of the detestable Montano, 
who seemed to live only to plague her. 

In about a month after their arrival^ 
and the day previous to that fixed ,on 
for the celebration of his lordship's 
marriage, Alexena and he were induced 
to accompany Theodore and Arabel 
on a party of pleasure, a little way from 
IBayonnc, They travelled in an open 
carriage, unattended, except by the 
coachman and postilion, and returned 
after having spent a very pleasant 
day, without encountering any accident 
that could excite suspicion ; but were 
inexpressibly distressed on their arri- 
val, at finding a note from Antonio, 
stating, that Evelene was seriously^ 
indisposed ; so much so, that her 
physicians were alarmed for her safct)^

Lord Mortimer commrmicated this un- 
welcome news, and the latter instantly 
hastened to her chamber, to change her 
travelling dress, where she requested to 
see Mrs. Hastings, but was informed- 
she had gone to Don Antonio's. Our 
heroine then hurried on an evening 
dishabille, and descended to join his 
lordship, who said he would wait in 
the hall, where he wished to give 
Roiirke some orders. It was quite 
dark when she reached it, but a man 
advanced, and drew her arm through 
his, and without speaking they entered 
the street; walking on at a quick 
pace for some time; Alexena lament- 
ing the indisposition of her friend at 
such an unpropitious moment, until 
surprised at her companion's taci- 
tru'nity, she begged to know the cause 
of his silence, and not receiving an 
answer, stopped. Imagine her dis- 
tress and amazement, on finding her- 
self ^^i^h a stranger, in an unfre- 



CASTLE OF SANTA MAIICO. 251 

^uented street ; the first impulse of her 
heart was to fly, but that, her conductor 
prevented, by seizing her in his arms, 
and the following- idstant she was sur- 
rounded by a band of ruffians, who 
muffled her in a cloak to prevent her 
cries, and bore her swiftly along to the 
beach, where she was put on board a 
boat that lay in readiness; and in a 
very few moments after, carried into the 
cabin of a brigantine, which instantly 
got under weigh. 

When the cloak was removed, the 
unfortunate Aiexena found herself seat- 
ed between the detestaljle Montano and 
Don Philip ; at which she expressed 
her despair and terror by a })iercing 
shriek, and fell senseless into the arms of 
the latter. On her recovery, the monk 
wounded her feelings by bitter taunts, 
and, with horrible execrations, doomed 
her to perpetual misery. ' Where now,' 
said he, ' is vour English hero to res- 
' cue you from my power? Would you 
-' know? — Yes! — that look is suihcient.

'Oh! monster!' exclaimed Alexena,

a sarcastic grin, ' and will, doubtless^

Alexena, as she fell on her knees,

streamed from her beauteous eyes, 
und the hardened Acasto could not 
behold her unmoved. In the gentlest 
tones of persuasive eloquence, he en- 
deavoured to cahrs her fears, and most 
solemnly promised to protect her from

kijury and insult of every description. 
She, however, was acquainted with his 
character, and put little trust in his pro- 
mises : yet clung to him rather than be 
left with Montano, even for a moment. 

In about an hour, Don Acasto 
shewed her a bed, and intreated her 
to seek a few hours repose, then left 
her to the solitude of the cabin, 
the door of which she secured with two 
strong iron bolts ; then fell on her 
knees, and besought that Beneficent 
Being, unknown to whom a sparrow 
cannot fall unnumbered, to save her 
from the power of Don Philip, and hii^ 
vile associates. She did not undress, 
nor did sleep seal her weary eyelids 
through the long and anxious night; 
day was only to bring new sufferings; 
and wlien Montano next morning 
knocked for admission, she felt the 
blows on her heart; however, she sum- 
moned courage to admit him, and 
shortly after, breakfast was served. 
When her bitter meal was finished. 



S54 ALEXEXA ; OR THE 

Don Philip invited her to walk on 
deck, as the air of the cabin was close 
and unwholesome; having- no choice, 
she slowly followed him, where, with 
horror, she beheld the few mariners 
that were suflicient to man the vessel. 
Their countenances were charts, dis- 
playing all the shoals and quicksands of 
iniquity — every furrow in their cheeks, 
a harbour of crimes — every movement 
led to destruction — their voices, thun- 
der — their eyes glare lig^htning — their 
breath, pestilence — their religion, athe- 
ism — their hopes, perdition. Such were 
the seamen that guided the vessel of 
Acasto through the liquid deep. Alex- 
ena shuddered, as she mentally de- 
manded, " Are these the inmates of 
Santa Marco?" Alas! her thoughts re- 
plied,— ''even so." Were those wretches 
to supply the place of her late friends? 
Again, her tortured imagination an- 
swered in the affirmative ; but had not 
the cruel, the bloody Montano assured 
her, Mortimer was no more. Oh! yes, 
but pitying heaven contradicted his 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. So5 

assertion, and in her lieart she felt con- 
vinced his lordship was then anxiously 
seeking her^, assisted by his friends. 

Day after day passed in the same 
horrid routine; the wind continued 
fair, and Acasto informed his lovely 
captive, that by sun-set next evening 
he hoped to land at the foot of the 
Pyrennees, where horses were to be in 
readiness to convey them to his castle; 
'^ though somewhat gloomy. Lady 
Alexena," said he, •' I trust, wants 
for nothing that can make solitude 
agreeable, and where, after a little time^ 
I hope to see you perfectly happy." 

Again she shuddered. — " Happy! 
oh! yes, Don Philip, if your inhospi- 
table grounds will afford me even a 
scanty grave, I shall then, indeed, think 
myself so," 

" Lovely innocent!" exclaimed Mon- 
lano, ironically; ''there are many secrets 
in the castle, which you, as a woman,, 



^6 ALEXENA; OR THE 

must have curiosity to see, and, surely, 
the pursuit of such inestimable know- 
ledge will sooth (lie solitary hours of 
Lady A lexena ; particularly, as she will 
find many objects of compassion, whom 
Don Philip will be charmed in assist- 
ing her to relieve." 

There was much more meanino- in 
the countenance of Montano than in 
his words, which were riddles too diffi- 
cult for the victim of his malice to 
expound ; but she felt convinced the 
latter were not without some dreadful 
import, though, as yet, she thanked 
Heaven, inexphcable to her. 

On the second day of her captivity, 
tlie brii::antine came to anchor in a 
small creek, between St. Sebastian and 
Fontarabia; defended from the storm 
on every side, by inaccessible rocks;, 
however, as it was almost dark, they 
continued on board that night, but 
disembarked early the foilowing morn- 
in^; and after a most faliguin<j scram- 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 257 

ble over rii^j^id precipices, they arrived 
at the entratice of a wood, where the 
ahnost exhausted Alexena was placed 
on a horse by Don Philip, and in- 
stantly surrounded by his fierce and 
savage attendants, who led the way, 
through almost pathless wilds, to the 
dark and weather-beaten towers of 
Santa Marco.

** Ob ! can you think of nothing dearer to me ? 
Dearer than liberty, my country, friends, 
Much dearer than my life, that I have lost.'* — 

On the night when Alexena went to 
change her dress, for the purpose of 
visiting Evelene, Lord Mortimer sum- 
moned Rourke, to whom he gave some 
necessary directions, and when his ser- 
vant retired, crossed the hall to the 
vestibule, where he waited for Alexena. 
In a few moments, a female, her exact 
height and figure, appeared, and he, 
not doubting she was the beloved ob- 
ject of liis affections, drew her arm 
through liis, and sallied into the street ; 
having been much amused during the 
course of the day, he proposed a re- 
petition of their country excursion, as 
soon as Evelene would be able to par- 
take of the enjoyment, and walked 
on, without noticing her silence; his 
mind occupied with a diversity of 
agreeable sensations, and his thoughts 



fjASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 250 

dwelling on the ecstacy that should be 
his the next day, when he was awaked 
from his dream of happiness, by his 
companion exclaiming, '' I fear, friend 
Pedro, you have mistaken your way." 
" Pedro! — Pedro!" cried his lordship, 
as he became deadly pale, '* in the name 
of Heaven who, or what are you?" 

'^ Who should I be, but Helen, M. 
Duval's housemaid?*' — " And where is 
Lady Alexena? How did you get hold 
of my arm, you sorceress?" said he, 
as he grasped her hand, " Say, tell me, 
who induced you to deceive me thus? 
But, Merciful Powers ! while I am tri- 
fling away time so precious, it may be 
Alexena needs my assistance." Then 
letting his prisoner go, flew back to 
the hotel ; but his wily guide took 
the precaution of making that no easy 
task, and it was not without infinite 
trouble he regained it in about two 
hours after. 

Alexena was then many leagues at 



260 alexena; oh, the 

sea, while her unfortunate lover ran 
from house to house, in a state of dis- 
traction, making' fruitless inquiries, and 
sending persons to search for her^ in 
every direction; hut, of course, they 
all returned unsuccessful. On arriving 
at the hotel of his friend Antonio, he 
there found Evelene in perfect health ; 
nor had she been unwell; neither had 
Mrs. Hastings been there; and in an 
instant every domestic of the family 
were sent to join in the pursuit; the 
entire nisrht was spent in vain search; 
and the following day found Lord Mor- 
timer, instead of the happiest, the most 
miserable of men. Being at length 
convinced she was again in the power 
of Montano, he consulted the friend 
who had so forcibly drawn (he cha- 
racter of Don Philip, and begged to 
know in what direction the Castle of 
Santa Marco lay ; that he might in- 
stantly proceed there, as he felt as- 
sured Alexena would shortly be a 
prisoner within it's walls. M. Dubois, 
gtive him written directions, describing 



GASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. SGi 

its situation willi much accuracy ; but 
at the same time attiimirii^ his belief, 
that it would be utterly impossible to 
enter it by force, and that his lordship's 
only hope was in overtaking Lady 
Alexena, before she could arrive. He, 
therefore, hastened to seek some useful 
assistants, and in three hours after set 
out, attended by his faithful domestics 
Rourke, xVlbert, and two trusty guides, 
who were well acquainted with the mazy 
windings of the Pyrenean paths. One 
of these men was remarkably strong 
and handsome, while his language and 
address clearly evinced he iiad not 
always been in such an abject situation; 
havitig once understood his lordship 
wished to arrive at Santa Marco as 
soon as possible, he led him by the 
most ujifreq<iented paths and by-ways, 
throuirh the rude bosom of those 
wilds; and on the third day, a little 
before the shades of evening fell, they 
discovered Don Acasto and Alexena 
ascending the mountains, about a quar- 
ter of a mile before them. Lord Mor- 



262 ALEXEXA ; OR THE 

timer, at the first glimpse, had not a 
doubt of her identity ; and his first im- 
pulse was to attack the vile ruffian, and 
rescue her by force ; but Don Philip had 
more than twice the number of attend- 
Imts, equally well armed, and, therefore, 
such an attempt could not possibly 
be attended with the slightest chance of 
success ; besides, should defeat ensue, 
he was aware Montano would have 
him instantly put to death, and then, 
who would rescue Alexena from their 
accursed power ? To assail them 
openly would be little less than mad- 
ness, and it became necessary to use 
the utmost caution, to keep at a conve- 
nient distance, that he might be able to 
seize the first unguarded moment, if 
one should occur, to carry her off. 

About half an hour after dusk, Don 
Acasto arrived at a convent, where he 
rested for the night, and his lordship 
at a little cottage, where his guide was 
known, and mjde heartily welcome. 
There was some venison boiling on the 



CASTLH OF SANTA MARCO. 2^3 

fire, and every appearance of connfort 
in this sequestered spot, the owner of 
which was a stout athletic man, with 
an open, generous countenance, and 
from his attention to Monfrane, seemed 
to be under some particular obligation. 
When they had been about half an 
hour in the cottage. Lord Mortimer 
took his guide aside, and expressed his 
most anxious wish to obtain some in- 
formation respecting Don Philip's im- 
mediate intentions, and whether there 
would not be a possibility of attacking 
him with success. Before Monfrane had 
time to reply, two of Acasto's domes- 
tics entered, accompanied by a monk 
from the neighbouring monastery, who 
having apologized for the intrusion, 
begged a shelter for his companions^ 
ulleuins: his house was so full, that there 
was not a single spot with which they 
<jould be accommodated. The cotta- 
ger said he could afford them a shelter 
and food, but had not a bed to olTer; 
however, if they would sleep in chairs 
^y his ftre, they were heartily welcome. 



864 ALEXENA; OR THE 

The men gladly assented, and the 
wonk shortly alter returtied to his 
monastery, wlicre one of the guides 
offered to accompany him ; his lord- 
ship's fears led him to believe there 
was some treachery intended, but hovr 
to avoid it he knew not, and contented 
himself by giving his domestics a sign 
to be on the alert, then turning to 
the strangers, endeavoured to enter 
into conversation. 

The elder of the two was deaf, or 
pretended to be so, and spoke not three 
words during the entire evening, but 
his companion seemed resolved to make 
amends for his taciturnity, by giving 
Lord Mortimer a long-winded detail of 
his journey through the mountains, and 
the number of leagues he had yet to 
travel before the termination of it. 
His lordship, marking his inclination 
for talking, prevailed on him to drink 
a considerable quantity of wine, that 
he might obtain all the information in 
Larco's power to give. The stratagem 






CASTLE OP SANTA MAHCO. 265 

had the desired effect, and as soon 
as the latter observed his companion 
had fallen asleep, he drew his chair a 
little nearer to that of his lordship, and 
in a low voice said, "you musf know, 
Siijnior, I have the honor to serve one 
of the most liberal masters in Spain, 
and who would be in every way unex- 
ceptionable, only for his rambling dis- 
position ; he is here to-day, for instance, 
to-morrow, if possible, he might be ia 
Madrid, and absolutely wearies his 
servants to death, trudging after hirn 
through wild desarts, such as these; 
crossing the seas, and for ever pending 
us with despatches from one place to 
the other, as if we were embassadors ; 
but thank my stars, I believe something 
has now fallen in his way, that will keep 
him quiet for a few weeks. Some time, 
ago he changed his chaplain, and I 
believe in my conscience, gained little 
by the bargain ; but be that as it 
may, father Montano became a part of 
our family a few weeks since, and ac- 
companied my lord to Bayonne, where 

VOL. I. M 



266 ALEXENA; OR THE 

he had some particular business, and 
there happened to see a beautiful 
Spanish lady, with whom he tell dee[)ly 
in love; so, as usual, became restless 
and unhappy, till father Montano found 
out the cause, and contrived a plan for 
gettini^ the lady into his power, which, 
though very simple, succeeded to a mira- 
cle, and they are now at the neighbour- 
ing monastery, on their journey to the 
Castle of Santa Marco ; a fine old place, 
I am told, only there is one great ob- 
jection to it; being haunted these ages 
past, by the Spirits of its former owners, 
who were a great family of warriors, 
and it appears, they haTe not forgotten 
their old sports yet, for they often raise 
such an uproar, as it resolved to have 
the whole place to themselves again ; 
yet they never do any harm, nor have I 
ever heard that they so much as knocked 
one person on the head; but the ghosts 
outside are not quite so peaceably dis- 
posed ; — there's Belzo Carracci, who 
sometimes pays a visit to the neigh- 
bourhood, and makes araeuds, with sk

vengeance, as he generally cuts the 
throats of some dozens of travellers 
before he shifts his quarters; and not 
one of the holy brotherhood, have been 
able to get as much as a glimpse of 
him ; but should he attack us, you may 
rely on it, he will be warmly received, 
as we are all extremely well armed, 
and, I trust, would die like men, should 
there be occasion." 

While Larco yet continued to talk, 
Monfrane returned, accompanied by 
the cottager, who had followed him, 
and, in a few minutes, expressed a de- 
sire to speak to his lordship apart ; to 
which the latter assented, and they 
retired to a little room, adjacent to the 
kitchen, where, after a few prefatory 
words, the former said, he was aware 
that his lordship was the lover of the 
lady, the then captive of Don Philip, 
and as it was utterly impossi!)le to res- 
cue her by force, he would recommend 
strataii:em. '' Our best method, I con- 
ceive," he continued, "is to follow them

and carry oft' the lady. I will procure 
the assistants, and you can have little 
compunction in exterminating two vil- 
lains, who are, and always have been 
capable of committing the most atro- 
cious and deadly crimes." 

Here Monfrane paused, and his lord- 
ship beheld him with surprise and 
Avonder, as he appeared perfectly ac- 
quainted with the private character of 
Don Philip and Montano, but feared 
his friendly advice was the foundation 
of some deep plan laid for his destruc- 
tion. Monfrane beheld the varying 
emotions of his lordship, which were 
strongly jnarked on his countenance, 
and on seeing doubt depicted there, 
appeared hurt, nay, grieved, that his 
iionesty was suspected, or his word 
questioned, and impatiently demanded, 
whether his odered services w^ould be 
^accepted. Lord Mortimer at that mo- 



eAS-TLE OF SANTA MAHCO. ^69 

ment caught his eye, which was so ex- 
pressive of sincerity, that he laid his 
hand on that of Monfrane, and said, 
** I trust to your honor and discretion, 
and though a total stranger to your 
motives, feel that you are not the per- 
son you wish the world to think you ; 
my fate heretofore has been rather ex- 
traordinary, and should I now be in- 
debted to you for the escape and safety 
of Lady Alexena de Guzman, believe 
me you will find I have a grateful heart, 
as well as the means to make you 
ample compensation." 

" Well, then, my lord, rest assured 
you have found a trusty friend, and that 
Monfrane will prove himself worthy 
your confidence. In the first place, 
I know who you are, and your recent 
advontures^ and am charmed that you 
have the good fortune to be attended 
by two truly brave and faithful domes- 
tics. As to myself, a superior power 
prevents me giving you any informa- 
tion, and you are merely to look on^

and command me as your g-uide; but 
at the same time, your safety depends 
on }our complying \Yitb my advice in 
every instance. I am acquainted ^Yilh 
Santa ^larco, audits terrors; but fear 
not, Providence has raised a powerful 
friend for your beloved Alexena, and 
1hou:ih she may be doomed to sufier 
many trials, before the liour of her de- 
liverance, yet rest assured, her safety is 
imqueslionable. I shall now wish you 
good nigjjt, as I must give Larco a 
jjlausiiiie story to tell, should he be 
questioned by Don Philip; as meeting 
\\\*\\ stranoers in those uninhabited 
"•.vikls, v.oidd naturally excite alarm and 
suspicions, tliat might, in a great mea- 
sure, defeat our purposes. This Larco 
is a talkative, simple fellow; I will 
fn-st draw lilm into conversation, then, 
as a matter of course, account for 
your appearance in the best manner 
my ingenuity will suggest. 1 believe I 
wi]| say you are a Spanish merchant, 
on your way to France; — yes! yest 
that, with some etceteras, will answer 
charmiui'lv." 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 271 

Monfrane then left his lordship al- 
most bewildered by amazement ; his 
whole conduct had been so extra- 
ordinary, yet so respectfnl, and so 
"apparently sincere, that he felt pcr- 
snaded Providence had raised a new 
frietid in the person of a stranger, to 
assist in rescuing' the lovely Alexena 
from the grasp of the inhuman Acasto, 
and his detestable coadjutor. He re- 
tired to rest, lost in wild conjecture, 
>vho this new friend could be, but of 
thecertainty^ hnd not the sliglit^st idea., 
and shortly aft-er, fell into a sound 
sleep, while Rourke and Albert lay on 
a mattress beside his bed, fully accou- 
tred, with their carbines in their hands, 
ready to defend him at a moment's 
warning; and Lion, the canine compa- 
nion of tlie former, from his attention 
on the sliglitest noise, appeared to be 
consiable of (he watch. 

At sun-rise next morning, Monfrane 
entreated admission, and informed his 
lordvJiij), that Don Acasto was already 



272 alexena; or th£ 

on the road. " You may remain here 
an ho r longer/' he continued, " and 
by that time, they will be far enough in 
advance." Lord Mortimer instantly 
dressed, and a few moments after, par- 
took of an excellent, though homely, 
breakfast, prepared by his kind host, 
whom he offered to reward ^with a con- 
siderable purse, but of which the latter 
would not accept a farthing. '' No, 
uo, my lord," said the cottager, " I 
have received orders for what I have 
done, and could not accept any thing, 
if I was even inclined, which 1 assure 
you is not the case." 

His lordship thought this still more 
strange, but made no comment, and 
shortly after departed, attended by his 
guides and domestics.

rontrarvj he often appeared in open 
da}', perfectly secure in tliose solitary 
Avilds, \\hose simple inhabitants feared 
and respected him. He was the avowed 
friend of the fatherless and widow, and 
was never known to oppress the de- 
solate, the unprotected, or distressed : 
the clergy of every denomination were 
his averpiion, and seldom had rea- 
son to praise liis clemency ; but even 
amon:j; the priesthood there were ex- 
ceptions, and more than once, lie was 
known to have treated with disfino'ujsh-

of persons, and of circumstances, were 
conceived most astonisliMi<2:, and lie 
moved from place to place wilh incredi-

Tiity of his favourite haunts, were large

jyarlakcrs of his boniUyj and (his libe- 
rality, accotnpanied by llie terror which 
his very name inspired, impressed on 
their uninformed minds^, silence relativ^e 
to every action of lus^ wliich fell under 
their observation, and precluded the 
})0ssibility of indncini»" them to betray 
him; he was known by reputation in 
every habitable part of Spain, as a most 
terrible l)andit, from whose power there 
was ahnost an utter impossibility of 
escaping, if he once resolved to punish. 
His retreats were situated in the most 
savage wilds of thePyrennees, whereno 
jiower dare pursue him, and from those 
ahnost impenetrable Iiaunts, he ven- 
tured into eilicSj many leagues from 
his native glens, where he spread (error 
among the worthless, rich, luxurious, 
or mercenary, lie was in person tall, 
iUhletic, and graceful; his hair black as 
the pbimes of the raven; liis eyes full, 
bright, and penetratitig ; his teeth white 
as ivory; his every movement majestic, 
and had he not been a ro'ober, would, 
by the fair^ have been accounted one of 



276 alexena; or the 

Nature's noblest master-pieces. Sucli^ 
however, was Belzo Carracci, the terror 
of the surrojincliii"^ country ; little was 
known of his real disposition, as he 
was obeyed with the most riscid ex- 
actncss by his band ; but when roused 
by those passions which agitate man- 
kind, particularly anger, the boldest 
of his troop trembled beneath his frown, 
and none cou'd bear unabashed, the 
piercin*^ glance of his eye, when level- 
ed with agaze of penetrating inquiry. 
His voice was full, deep, and sonorous, 
and, when pleased, plaintive, sweet, and 
persuasive; but this rarely happened, 
never, except when soothing the dis- 
tressed, and yet, extraordinary as it 
may seem, many felt happy, when as- 
sured of his protection. 

To the character of such a man. 
Lord Mortimer could not be inatten- 
tive, and he listened with wonder to the 
detail of his virtues and vices. ''In the 
power of this singular bandit," said he, 
mentally, '' I may be in a few day&j 



CASTLE OF SANTA MAHCO. 277 

nay, hours, and yet the idea is not attend- 
ed with any sensation of uneasiness." 
Thus he remained some time lost in 
thought, and then resumed the con- 
versation, as it amused him : to Mon- 
frane he was indebted for many curious 
and entertaining anecdotes of this 
wondrous bandit, and listened with 
eager attention, often starting at the 
relation of events that were odd, horri- 
ble, and ambiguous. Conversing on this 
subject, he followed Don Philip towards 
the Castle of Santa Marco, preserving 
a necessary distance, until at length 
they arrived in the bosom of tremen- 
dous mountains, piled on each other 
in rude deformity, where savage chaos 
reigned among deep and shaggy glens, 
whose rocky caverns formed secure 
haunts for Carracci, and his formidable 
banditti. 

The dark sides of these mountains 
were covered with vast forests of pine, 
from whose thick shades, the veils of 
beasts of prey smote the ear of the

piccs, ^vitllOllt balustrade or battlement, 
and so narrow too, that the sickenino; 
fancy shuddered at the idea of stumbling' 
on the sharp and rui^o'ed path, as such 
an event would most likely be attended 
uith destruction; yet the peril of 
wandering over them was often com- 
pensated by the exquisitely romantic 
scenery, that at every tin-ning, burst on 
the astonished sense of (he weary ex- 
plorer of their beauties ; frequently, the 
meandering road led into the bosom 
of an enchanting- valley, while above, 
the huls of {feasants were rudely 
erected on the point of some hanging- 
})recipice, in airy dreariness, threaten* 
ingto tumble, with every blast, into the 
almost fathomless glen, whose frightful 
4ind yawning chasm gaped to receive 
the totterino;' mansions. 



o 



Lord Mortimer beheld such scents 



CASTLE OF SANTA MARCO. 270 

as these \vi(li cnlliusiasin; they suited 
the disturbed state of his reeH!i5z;s_, aud 
streniitheued it to bear succeeding- trials 
with becoming' fortitude; his busy and 
fearful imagination, often presented 
the bold and stern form of Belzo 
Carracci, standing on the brow of a 
commanding clifF, pointing Acasto to 
his bandits. Such thouohts as tliese 
frequently caused him to start, as for 
an instant lie believed the illusion real. 

As the third evenin*? cast her sable 
mantle across the rouoh shoulders of 
the mountains, Monfrane descried the 
distant sea, and pointed out the neces- 
sity of being doubly cautious, as they 
were fast approacliing tiie castle, and 
as the frequent occurrence of liills and 
vallies rendered it unsafe to be Milhin 
a mile of Acasto or his attendants, lest 
they should be recognized, as they de- 
scended into the glen, or on the rising 
brow of the mountain. Lord Morlinier 
assented to tlie truth of the observation, 
and ordered his domestics to proceed 



280 ALEXESA ; OR THE 

slower, as he would stop at the first 
place that offered a slioltcr; shortly 
lifter, they heard the chime of a con- 
vent l)ell, which was a signal that Don 
Philip would proceed no farther that 
night; and the chill air of the moun- 
tains becoming very unpleasant, his 
lordship heartily wished for the cheer- 
ing blaze of a wood fire, to reanimate 
his almost congealed and stififened limbs. 
His guide observed his anxiety, and 
instantly informed him, there was such 
another cottage as that in which he 
passed the former night, a quarter 
of a mile farther, where orders were 
already issued, to have a supper and 
a bed prepared for him. Again, Lord 
Mortimer felt astonished, but finding 
inquiries for his mysterious friend Were 
fruitless, he thanked his guide, without 
making any observation ; and on his 
arrival, found some excellent fish, with 
abundance of choice wine, bread, and 
dried fruits, on which he and his 
attendants supped with vast saiisfac- 
tion, as being unexpected, made i-t 
doubly acceptable. 



CASTLE OF SANTA MATICO. 281 

Next morning, afier breakfast, Moii- 
frane observed, that before the sun 
bathed his fiery coursers in the glossy 
waves of the Atlantic, they should see 
the grey towers of Santa Marco. His 
lordship, who was already much 
fatigued, was not a little rejoiced at 
the prospect of so speedily terminating 
a wearisome journey, and proceeded 
with renovated hopes; as they ad- 
vanced on the castle, the mountains 
became more w ildly terrific ; while, from 
behind each projecting rock, Rourke 
expected to see the grim faces of the 
robbers peep forth, in the act of spring- 
ing on (hem ; indeed, the craggy steeps 
which tJiey were every moment obliged 
to pass, were sufficient to inspire 
Carracci himself with awe. 

At length the hour arrived, which 
was to find Alexena a prisoner within 
the walls of Santa INIarco ; every mo- 
ment Lord Mortimer strained his sia^ht 
to see that dreaded spot, which he now 
wished, yet feared, to behold. " What?"^ 
he mentally exclaimed, '' What shalJ 



28f alexena; on the 

I dOj if til is castle be impregnable to 
outward attack, and proof against stra* 
tao-em? Oh 1 what then will be the 
fate of my beloved Alexena? To what 
perils, to wliat insults, may she not be 
exposed?" As these last thoughts flash- 
ed on his tortured brain, they almost 
caused distraction ; until Hope, that 
gentle soother of all onr griefs, whis- 
pered comfort, and lulled his fears; 
fche promised to restore his Alexena, 
assisted by love and friendship. Oiice 
more the cloud of anxiety was chased 
from his brow; care retreated, and 
liope encouraged, while she pointed 
to the haven of his viishes. They had 
just then descended into a frightful, 
deep, and rugged s^^cn, which grew 
narrower as they advanced, and up 
which the storm whistled, and swept the 
black and horrid rocks that were piled 
to the clouds, foruiitifr a narrow wind- 
ing defile, at the first turn of which, 
the Caslle of Santa Marco was revealed 
to their view, frowiiinir on the "rim and 
frighlfid landsxape by which it was 
surrounded. 



CASTLE OF SANTA MAIICO. 283 

The moment his eye caught its grey 
moss-clad battlements, he involuntary 
started, but endeavoured to suppress 
his emotion ; and as he continued to 
gaze on its antique and gloomy tower?^ 
bis countenance became pale and agi- 
tated ; Monfrane observed his varying 
sensations with evident concern, and 
represented the necessity of turning 
out of the direct path to the cottage, 
Avhich was discernible through the open 
vista ; but Lord Mortimer refused to 
stir until Alexena should cross the draw- 
bridge, which was already lowered to 
receive her; the following moment he 
caught a view of her light drapery as 
she emerged from the wood ; and when 
t^he was received into the court-yard 
by Don Acasto's attendants, his heart 
throbbed with agony, and he passion- 
ately exclaimed, " Oh ! my Alexena, 
I fear 1 have seen you for the last time. 
Alas! beliold what a numerous train 
of soldiers and domestics are already 
on the ramparts; now, how can 1 hoj)e 
for success," Again Monfrane urged 



2M ALEXENA ; OR TIIE 

him to hasten to the cottage, as there 
was a possibiHty he might be discovered 
by the bands on the castle walls, whick 
would insure inevitable destruction, 
and reminded him of the power of his 
unknown friend. " Recollect/' he con- 
tinned, ''that he haspromiscd toprotect 
the object of your affections, and will 
be equally- careful of your safety, unless 
you forfeit his kindness, by wilfully 
disobevinij his wishes." 

The manner of Monfrane was im- 
pressively solemn; his words impressed 
conviction on his lordship's heart, and 
when he arrived at his rustic hotel, felt 
considerably relieved from those chill- 
ing apprehensions, which had so hitelj 
driven him to the brink of despair. 
After supper, he requested to know was 
there a possibility of ascertaining the 
exact situation of the castle, as, notwith- 
standing his fatigue, he felt assured he 
could not be easy in his mind, until its 
strength, and the possibilities of sur- 
prisino: or storminij^ it, were accuratelv 



CATTLE OF SANTA MAIICO. 3^5 

understood by him. His guide promised 
to gratify his wishes the following night, 
and lead him through all the private 
paths, that by inspecting them, he might 
judge of the difficulties which were to be 
encountered ; but absolutely refused to 
go until his lordship's strength and 
spirits were restored by repose; to this 
the latter was obliged to assent, though 
much against his inclination, and waited 
with the utmost impatience, the ap- 
proach of the following evening. 

When the hour arrived, he set out, 
accompanied by Monfrane, Rourke, 
and Albert, well armed. The moon 
shone with peculiar brightness, which 
was very fortunate — the road in many 
places being almost impassable. As 
they proceeded, they heard the waves 
beating against the adjacent rocks, 
^nd the screams of the wild sea birds; 
and after considerable labour, gained 
the summit of one of the frightful pre- 
cipices, from which they had an excel- 
lent view of the castle, and beheld with 



28o ALEXENA; OR THE 

-wonder, its asloiiisliing extent. It stood 
on a vast rock, which rose perpendicu- 
larly out of the bosom of one of the 
most frigbUiil glens the sportive hand 
of nature ever formed, and was uncon- 
nected with the ridgy sides of the adja- 
cent valley, except by the draw-bridge, 
when it chanced to be lowered. The 
rock had few projections, and to fasten 
either rope or ladder, was utterly im- 
possible, even if there had not been 
strong ramparts built on its rude brows, 
whose walls were flanked with small 
round towers, at equal distances, which, 
with a tremendous portcullis, iron- 
barbed barriers, and draw-bridge, effec- 
tually crushed the hopes of intrusion ; 
and should those obstacles be sur- 
mounted, there was a strong guard to 
contend with. Every thing pointed out 
its formidable strengrth — hiii'h black 
walls, small gothic windows, frowning 
towers, and rude battlements — convey- 
ed a deep conviction of its stability, 
which seemed to hold the idea of assault 
in scorn. Lord Mortimer gazed on it 



CASTLE OF SANTA MAnCO. 287 

in hopeless despondency, yet resolved 

to inspect the forrnidabie rock which 

supported it, as the shades of night 

promised to favour and screen him from 

/ " observation. He inquired from IMon- 

rri^r^cL fi'ane, was there a possibility of ^ainin^ 

^'"*' its base, and was answered in the 

affirmative, with an offer to conduct 

him to it, t!ie moment darkness would 

admit of their approach.
