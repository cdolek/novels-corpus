PREFACE 



I 



F purity of motive might be ex- 
pected to atone lor detective 
execution, the Authoress of the fol- 
lowing sheets, would feel no painful 
apprehensions on submitting them to 
the notice of the public. 

Conscious that she had been actu- 
ated by principles, which the bene- 
v^^ volent must applaud, and even the 
^ wise could not disapprove, she should 



[ Iv ] 

dismiss Iier \vork to the ordeal of po- 
pular judgment, if not with confidence, 
at least with none of that distressing 
Hiixicty, whieli she at present expe- 
riences. 

But, alas ! aware as she is, that tlie 
stern impartiality of criticism must 
not be expecled to soften its decisions 
in compliment to the sccrtt motives 
of tliose upon whose productions It 
pronounces its verdift ; she lias no- 
tliing to lessen that alarm, which an 
xmobtrusive character may be supposed 
to feel, on assuming a position so con- 
spicuous, as that in which she has now 
placed herself. 

She knows that the public, to whose 
sentence her volumes are submitted, 



[ V ] 

is not to be influenced in its .decrees 
by the private circumstances of those 
who vuliintarily appear at its tribunal ; 
and, therefore, were she even to urge 
the work ijad been undertaken that 
^he might be tlie better enabled to 
soLncc t!ie latter davs of an ai^cd and 
infirm parent, (ihc dear recollection of 
whom is all tliat / ow remains toiler;) 
that tlie greater part of it iiad been 
written in tlie season of trial and 
afiiietion, or amidst hurry and incon- 
venience; when she was attending the 
bed of a declining mother, or hanging 
in trembling fear (the reasonableness 
of which, a late mournful event has 
too fatally manifested) over the sick 
couch of an only sister; she still would 



[ vi J 

have no riglit to hope that the repre- 
sentation would ward off censure wlicre 
it was deserved, palliate the defects of 
composition, or make amends for the 
absence of novelty and interest. 

With all Its imperfections, therefore, 
on its head, she is compelled to submit 
her JS'^eiV' Forest Story to the world, 
under emotions, which sensibility will 
readily understand, and which gene- 
rosity will instinctively commiserate. 

Amidst, however, the various feelings 
which agitate her mind, at the moment 
when she bids a final farewell to the 
volumes that have so long engaged her 
occasional attention; she thinks it her 
duty to declare, that gratitude to 
the Friends whose names appear in the 



[ vii ] 

respectable list of lier Subscribers, is 
the paramount emotion; and that as 
the prote(?tion which they have afibrded 
her, has been her chief encouragement 
under the task in which she had en- 
gaged, so the recollecFtion of their 
favours will ever remain deeply en- 
graven on her heart. 

Their patronage, she has indeed, 
in some degree, striven to deserve, by 
endeavouring to make her volumes the 
medium of mental improvement, and 
moral and religious instruction ; and 
under all the anxiety that fills her 
bosom, it is some consolation to her to 
refle6l, that, however deficient they 
may be in the graces of didion, and 
the ornaments of genius, she is still 



[ viil 1 

enabled to flatter herself, tliey will be 
found to have a tendency to give 
stedfastness to piety, ardour to virtue, 
and confidence to truth.

HERBERT-LODGE. 



CHAPTER I. 

A yf RS. Herbert had been nearly twelve 
'*^^-*- months separated from her child- 
ren, when the approach of summer 
renewed that hope of clasping them 
again to her bosom, in which, at the 
preceding vacation, she had been dis- 
appointed, by her husband's insisting 
that Edmund and Matilda should pass 
the Christmas recess with their aunt' and 
uncle at Fitzmordaunt-Castle. 

No mtelligence to the contrary having 
yet reached the Lodge, Mrs. Herbert

with anxious solicitude awaited the arri- 
val of these dear ohje6ls of her maternal 
aifedion; nor was the deHght with which 
Mary anticipated the long-wished-for 
return of her play-fellows, less ardent 
than that of their tender and expelling 
mother. 

The cultivation of Edmund's little 
garden, which ever since their separation 
had been the constant care and principal 
amusement of Mary, was now attended 
to with double diligence. Trained by 
her hand, his favourite plants and shrubs, 
already began to bloom ; and rewarded 
her assiduity by their fragrance and 
beauty. ** See, mamma, how these lilacs 
blossom. Smell how sweet these hya- 
cinths are. Will not Edmund be charmed 
with the improvement in his jessamine 
bower ?" were remarks and enquiries 
daily made by this interesting child of 
simplicity and innocence. Juba, the 
petted spaniel of Edmund, was the faithful 



[ 3 ] 

companion of her labours; he attended 
her in all her walks without doors, slept 
on a cushion at her feet when within, 
and shared her kindness equally with a 
canary-bird, which Matildahad entrusted 
to her care. 

These marks of genuine sensibility, 
and strong attachment to her absent 
fnends, rendered the lovely orphan daily 
more dear to Mrs. Herbert; who deem- 
ing no pursuit too trifling to occupy 
Mary's attention, which in the most 
remote degree tended to foster the bene- 
volent aifeftions, readily entered into all 
her little plans; encouraged her in every 
undertaking v/hich had the happiness or 
pleasure of another for its obje(5l; and 
at Mary's request cheerfully assisted in 
arranging the play-room, and ornament- 
ing the apartments of her children. 

Never before had time appeared to 
Mary to move so tardily as during the 
present period of anxious expedation; 
B 2 



[ 4 ] 

even Mrs Herbert, disciplined as lier 
feelings were, and frequently as she had 
experienced the necessity of curbing 
them, could not on this occasion repress, 
though she endeavoured to conceal, her 
impatience. 

The wished-for day at length arrived: 
Edmund was already in his mother's 
arms; and Mary held his hands in hers, 
whilst her eyes were direded to the door 
in anxious search of his sister. Mrs. 
Herbert pressed the blooming boy to her 
throbbing bosom, and breathed over him 
a prayer of thanksgiving for his safe 
return; then loosing him from her em- 
brace, and presenting him to receive 
the ready welcome of his adopted sister, 
*^ and now my love," she cried, '* where 
is your companion ? where is my sweet 
Matilda?" 

Alas ! the fond mother's bitter cup of 
disappointment and sorrow was not yet 
full : instead of being accompanied by 



[ 5 J 

his sister, Ediiuiiul, she found, was 
charged with the following letter from 
Mr. Herbert. 

^' Your brother and Lady Antoinette 
have been hastily summoned to France; 
I have consented to their united request 
that Matilda should accompany them, 
and cannot allow myself to doubt of 
your concurrence in a plan, Avhich a 
moment's consideration will convince 
you must be greatly advantageous to 
the child. Lady Antoinette is, as you 
know, highly accomplished; she pro- 
mises to superintend the education of 
Matilda, who, with such an assistant, 
and in a country, where ease, elegance, 
grace, and fashion, are, as it were, the 
natural produce of the soil, she cannot 
fail to make a rapid progress in every 
desirable ac(|uirement. Matilda's beauty 
improves daily, and when heightened 
by the brilliant polish of a French edu- 
cation, I think we shall have no reasoa 



C ti 3 

to be ashamed of our daughter. This 
scheme has been hastily decided on, and 
time not permitting me to apprise you 
of it, Lady Antoinette obligingly under- 
takes to dire<5l every necessary prepara- 
tion. I shall accompany the party as far 

as , and probably continue on the 

Continent for some months. We quit 
town to-morrow, so that INIatilda can 
only se?id you a parting adieu, I at 
first intended taking Edmund (who will 
deliver this to you) abroad with me, but 
being undecided as to my own move- 
ments, and the length of my stay, I 
thouo;ht I mio'ht find him a troublesome 
incumbrance, and determined on sending 
him to pass the holidays at the Lodge. 
He is a fine boy, but wants spirit; neither 
is his genius so quick as ^latilda's. He 
has not yet entirely rubbed off the New- 
Forest rust; but time and the collision 
of a public school may still do much in 
refining and improving him, and corre(5l 



[ 7 ] 

the mi nous efFe6ls of voiir absurd svsteni 
of domestic petticoat education. 

" Yours, J. Herbert." 

It would be difficult to describe the 
emotions of JNlrs. Herbert's soul on 
perusing the above letter. Her maternal 
feelings had been wrought up to the 
utmost height by the prospect of imme- 
diate gratification ; when in an instant 
hope and expe6lation were annihilated 
by the cruel intelligence that JMatilda 
was irrevocably torn from her protecting 
bosom. That sickness of the heart 
arising from '* hope deferred," which 
she had before experienced, was enjoy- 
ment when compared with the anguish 
that now wrung her soul. In an agony 
bordering on despair, she clasped her 
hands, and lifting her eyes to heaven, 
sank back into -a chair ; a deadly paleness 
overspread her cheek, her pulse ceased 



i 8 ] 

to beat, and for a moment she lost the 
acuteness of her suffering, in the torpor 
of insensibility. It was, however, but 
for a moment. The cries of the children 
awakened her to life and recolle6lion^ 
and when on again opening her eyes, 
she perceived the distress that marked 
their features, when she saw the tears 
trickling down their cheeks, and heard 
their artless expressions of joy at her 
restoration, her bosom heaved with con- 
vulsive throbs, and throwing her arms 
round Mary and her darling Edmund, 
she burst into a passionate but salutary 
flood of tears. 

The door was at this instant opened 
by Dr. Fairford, whose animated coun- 
tenance lost much of its cbaracleristic 
cheerfulness as he advanced towards the 
weeping group, with an intention to 
enquire the cause of so much apparent 
distress. That the children were expe(5led 
at the Lodge on that day he had ah'eady 



r 9 ] 

known, and the purport of his present 
visit was to welcome their arrival; but 
seeing only Mary and Edmund in the 
room with Mrs. Herbert, it immediately 
occurred to him, that some fatal accident 
had happened to Matilda, and interested 
as he felt himself in all the family con- 
cerns, it was not without hesitation that 
he pronounced her name. Edmund, gen- 
tly disengaging himself from his mother's 
embrace, sprang into the arms of the 
excellent Do6lor, who received him with 
the most cordial affection, and listened 
with surprize not unmixed with deep 
concern, whilst he explained the occa- 
sion of his sister's absence. 

Mrs. Herbert, having in some degree 
recovered the first shock of- this most 
distressing disappointment, kissed the 
still Aveeping ^lary, and requesting that 
she would accompany Edmund into the 
dining-parlour, related to her venerable 
friend, with all the warmth natural to the 



[ 10 ] 

irritated state of her feelings, the cruel 
mortification she had just experienced. 

Dr. Fairford, with his usual serenity, 
recommended moderation in grief, and 
patience under suffering. '^ Alas! dear 
sir," interrupted the affli6led mother, 
** you have witnessed, I hope, that where 
my own welfare only was concerned, I 
could be resigned, patient, and even 
cheerful under disappointment: but in 
this case, where the present advantage 
of my child, perhaps even her eternal 
happiness, is at stake, how can I be 
calm? How can I palliate the cruel con- 
du6i of that father, who has thus robbed 
me of my child? When I contemplate 
Matilda under the guardianship and 
dire6lion of the unprincipled Lady An- 
toinette Fitzrnordaunt; as listening to 
her counsels, and imitating her example; 
placed beyond the reach of maternal 
care; in a foreign land, amongst un- 
feeling strangers; no warning voice to 



[ 11 } 

guard her young heart from evil impres- 
sions ; no kind adviser to sliield her 
from the sedudion of false sentiment, 
and the delusion of vanity; no friend 
sufficiently interested to watch over the 
gradual developement of her yet unin- 
formed mind, or attend to the preserva- 
tion of her health; separated, perhaps 
for ever, from me her natural guardian, 
her only proteftor under heaven ; — Oh, 
Doctor! how caa I contemplate this 
picture, and not sink beneath its horrors.'* 
^ My dear Airs. Herbert,' replied the 
Doctor, whilst he tenderly pressed her 
hand, ' let me entreat you to be com- 
posed, and allow your excellent under- 
standing to correal the frightful repre- 
sentation of imaginary evils, which you 
have sketched in the moment of poig- 
nant disappointment. Of these alarming 
consequences of Mr. Herbert's hasty, and 
I must say injudicious plan, which you 
have so feelingly described, I really can 



[ 12 ] 

see neither the certainty, nor indeed 
probability. It is true that neither the 
country to which Matilda is taken, nor 
the prote6lress under whom she is placed, 
are such as we could have chosen for 
the purposes of education or example ; 
but you will recoiled, that, from the 
capriciousness of Mr. Herbert's mind, 
and the unsteadiness of his determina- 
tion, it is very likely the child may 
ere long be again returned to her native 
country and her former instru6lress. In 
the interval she will be acquiring, inthe 
best manner, a language which is now 
considered as essential in the accom- 
plishments of every gentlewoman ; and 
you cannot have so mean an opinion of 
the influence of your own good exam- 
ple,' added he smiling, * as to be appre- 
hensive that in so short a time it should 
lose its effe6l upon your daughter, and 
not keep her steady to those excellent 
principles which you have so carefully 



[ 13 ] 

instilled into her mind, and so uniformly 
displayed in your own condud. Ho^y- 
ever, (he continued in a graver tone,) 
whatever may be the result of this 
unlocked for change in your views re- 
specling Matilda, all that we have to do, 
my dear friend, is to bear it M'ith Christian 
fortitude. Consider it in the worst 
point of view, and what is it but one of 
those trials which are kindly intended 
by the Being who sends them, for our 
eventual benefit. It has pleased Him to 
accumulate upon you many of these 
exercises of patience; and certain I am, 
that under every sorrow Avhich has befal- 
len you, your piety has always extracted 
a blessing from the infliclion, and induced 
you after awhile to exclaim, ' it is good 
for me that I have been in trouble.' 
Let patience then, my excellent friend, 
have its perfed work; bend with humble 
resignation to the decree of Him, who is 
infinitely wise as ^vell as infinitely bene- 



[ H ] 

volent ; and assure yourself, that in this, 
as well as every other case, He will make 
all things work together for good to them 
who trust in Him. Accept with grati- 
tude the blessing He has just bestowed 
upon you in giving to your embrace your 
lovely boy, and forget those painful 
reflexions which past and present dis- 
appointments may excite, in the antici- 
pation of brighter scenes and happier 
days in future.' 

In the hope of witnessing the salutary 
cfFeds of his advice. Dr. Fairford ac- 
cepted an invitation to dine at the Lodge; 
and in the afternoon, with the benevo- 
lent view of still more effe6lnally divert* 
ing Mrs. Herbert's thoughts from the sad 
subje6l with which he perceived they 
were yet too much occupied, he proposed 
that she should accompany the children 
and himself on a visit to Dame Wheatley 
at the Dairy; in which he was eagerly 
seconded by Mary and Edmund, who 



[ 15 ] 

declared they should not enjoy their pro- 
mised syllabub, if deprived of the com- 
pany of their dear mamma. 

]\Irs. Herbert, whose own pleasure was 
always estimated by the proportion of it 
which she conferred upon others, imme- 
diately acceded to their united request, 
and the party were preparing to set out 
in the coach for the old woman's cottage, 
when Dr. Fairford received a summons 
to attend a dying parishioner. This was 
an application to which the conscientious 
re6lor never returned a negative. With 
him the professional duties of a Minister 
of the Gospel were never superseded 
by unnecessary or trivial engagements; 
assuring Mrs. Herbert, therefore, that no 
circumstance of less importance should 
have deprived him of the pleasure of 
accompanying her and the children to 
the Dairy, he took leave of his disap^ 
pointed friend, and hastened to smooth 
the pillow of dissolution. 



[ 15 3 

" Beside the bed, where parting life was laid, 
"And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismay'd, 
** The reverend champion stood ; at his controul, 
" Despair and anguish fled the guilty soul, 
" Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise, 
*' And his last faltering accents whispered praise." 

Meanwliile Mrs. Herbert and her com- 
panions proceeded to Dame Wheat ley's 
residence, where they were received with 
that affectionate hospitality which is the 
genuine offspring* of goodness of heart 
united with simplicity of manners. 

The obligations of Mary to the bene- 
Tolence and care of this worthy old 
woman had been early and deeply im- 
pressed upon her mind; and she always 
anticipated a visit to the Dairy with the 
purest satisfa6lion. The sentiments of 
Edmund accorded in general with those 
of his adopted sister; he loved and re- 
speded Dame Wheatley therefore as 
much for Mary's sake, as for the warmth 
and sincerity of attachment which she 
displayed towards himself; an affedion 



t 17 ] 

inferior only to that which her heart 
acknowledged for IMrs. Herbert, whose 
excellence she almost regarded with 
idolatry. 

Nothing seemed wanting to complete 
the Dame's happiness on the present occa- 
sion, but the addition of I\Iatilda's com- 
pany, whose absence she most feelingly 
regretted, not unmixed with some reflec- 
tions on the squire's cruelty in '' banishing 
such a pretty creature to foreign parts 
abroad, amongst heathens and savages 
for aught she knew; though to be cer- 
tain, she had heard there were some few 
Christian folk even in France, though 
it were so far off; and she hoped with all 
her heart tliat young miss w^ould light 
amongst them." 

Mrs. Herbert, whose heart was still 
agitated by every maternal fear on her 
child's account, faintly smiled at the 
simplicity of the Dame's observations, 
which had been expressed with eyes full 



[ 18 ] 

of tears, and turned the conversation to 
less interesting subjects, enquiring into 
the particulars of her tenant's houshold. 
The improvement of her grand-daughter, 
and dutiful behaviour of her son, were 
themes on Avhich the old woman could 
ever expatiate with fluency and delight; 
and as she had an auditor who listened 
with an attention at once flattering and 
sincere, the hour of departure arrived 
before it was either expe6led or desired 
by the hospitable occupier of the Dairy. 
As Mrs. Herbert however had promised 
the children a walk home through the 
forest, she was under the necessity of 
hastening her return earlier than she 
otherwise would have done; and having 
bade a kind adieu to Dame Wheatley, 
she called Mary and Edmund, who were 
amusing themselves with gathering flow- 
ers in the court, and turned her steps 
towards the Lodge. 



[ 15 ] 

It was one of the finest evenings in the 
delightful month of June: nature had 
assumed the richness of a summer's dress: 
every obje6t seemed to breathe tranquil- 
lity on Mrs. Herbert's wounded spirit, 
and returning strength to her exhausted 
frame. Whilst she rested for a few 
minutes on a fallen 'oak, to inhale the 
bahiiy fragrance that floated on the air, 
the children, having spied some wild 
roses at a little distance, requested they 
might be allowed to ramble about a 
little in search of the flowers w^hich ena- 
melled the ground on every side, promi- 
sing not to go out of hearing, and to 
return by a limited time. As it Avas 
her great^t delight to indulge them in 
every innocent wish, she immediately 
assented to their desire, only begging 
John Wheatley (who was attending the 
party home) to see that they did not get 
into any situation of danger. Away 
they bounded light as roes, whilst Mrs. 



[ 20 ] 

Herbert, who watched their sylph-likc 
forms gradually lessening by distance, 
breathed a prayer tor the safety of her 
beloved Matilda, who was now so far 
removed from the watchful eye of ma- 
ternal tenderness. 

The evening breeze v/as mild and re- 
freshing. The setting sun appeared at 
intervals through the waving branches 
of the tall beech, whose tops were gilded 
by his parting rays. A gentle zephyr 
whispered through the surrounding foli- 
ao'e, and 2:ave additional effe6l to the 
soft notes of a turtle-dove, who cooed 
in mournful cadence from the bosom of 
a neighbouring wood. An holy calm 
reigned on every side, which seemed to 
invite the mind to seriousness and medi- 
tation. It was the scene imagined by 
the poet for the intelledual feast of 
thoughtful wisdom ; who 

" Oft seeks the sweet retired Solitude, 

" Where, with her best nurse ContemplatIon> 



r 21 ] 

** She plumes her feathers and lets grow her wings, 

^' That in the various bustle of resort, 

*' Were all— too ruffled and sometimes impair'd." 

From meditating on the heavenly 
scene around her, Mrs. Herbert was led 
by easy associations to those times of 
peace and happiness which she had en- 
joyed in '^ the days of other years;" in 
the gay season of childhood, when no 
corroding cares disturbed the tranquillity 
of her bosom; no painful retrospections 
of the past, or gloomy anticipations of 
the future, broke in upon her waking 
hours, or dissipated her nightly slum- 
bers; when 

** Gay hope was hers, by fancy fed, 

"■ Less pleasing if possess'd^ 
'* The tear forgot as soon as shed, 

*' The sunshine of the breast." 

She reverted with grateful recolIe6lion 
to that revered and lamented parent, who 
had been the guide and protectress of 
her infant years, and the instru6tress of 



t 22 ] 

her early mind; whose afFe6lion had 
been evinced by countless acts of kind- 
ness, the memory of which was still 
dear to her heart ; to whose invaluable 
lessons of piety and virtue she was in- 
debted for the fortitude that had sup- 
ported her w^er every trial; for the 
resignation that had lightened every 
sorrow. She dwelt also with a melan- 
choly pleasure on the remembrance of 
that beloved brother, who had been her 
earliest companion, and the dearest part- 
ner, of all her innocent pleasures, but 
over whose untimely fate hung an awful 
mystery, which her mind could not 
contemplate without the most painful 
suspense. The image of Fairford too 
would for a moment intrude itself into 
the pi6lure, which her fancy now pour- 
trayed; but she threw on it only an hasty 
and a transient glance: from the instant 
she had become the wife of another, 
Mrs. Herbert had striven, and success- 



[ 23 ] 

fully striven, to banish every too tender 
recoiled ion of the once-loved Frederic 
from her heart; so that his idea, when it 
did occur, became at each successive 
recurrence fainter and more faint, until 
it now appeared like the shade of a deser- 
vedly valued but long-departed friend. 
On Henry's form, however, on Henry's 
Virtues, she might dwell without reproof 
or impropriety. No rigid law of duty 
forbade her to cherish a brother s image 
in her inmost heart; nor could censure 
itself reprehend the tear that fell irj fond 
regret for his irreparable loss! '-Neither 
time, nor distance, nor the indistinft 
communications she had received of his 
fate, could weaken his claim upon her 
affection; and in the present moment of 
abstraction, the idea of this tender rela- 
tive presented itself to her thoughts in 
the most vivid colours. In that sweet de- 
lusion with which fancy delights to cheat 
4he mind, when its attention is deeply 



[ 24 ] 

engrossed by one particular obje6l, Mrs. 
Herbert again seemed to behold his 
graceful figure and animated counte- 
nance; and heard again his last adieu. 
Again, in imagination, she listened to 
his voice, and folded him to an aifedio- 
nate sister's bosom! She did not, how- 
ever, long enjoy this feast of ideal 
happiness, but was quickly awakened to 
real alarm by the loud barking of Juba, 
and a shrill cry from Mary, whom in the 
same instant, she beheld running towards 
her, pale and breathless. 

Starting from her seat, Mrs. Herbert 
hastily advanced to meet the child, and 
in a tone of anxious solicitude, eagerly 
enquired, '^ what had happened?" 

'^ Oh, mamma! he's dead, he's killed," 
cried the little girl, with looks of wild 
affright. '' Dead?" exclaimed Mrs. 
Herbert, whose maternal fears naturally 
referred the words to Edmund; and with- 
out waiting for further information, iuj 



[ 25 ] 

stantly rushed into tlie thicket. She 
had not proceeded many paces, however, 
before her most alarming apprehensions 
were reliev^ed, by the sight of Edmund 
himself, who was hastening towards her 
apparently unhurt. *' Thanks be to 
heaven, my beloved boy, that my fears 
were groundless,"^ she cried, as she clasped 
him to her throbbing bosom; ^' but 
vrhat is the meaning of this alarm and 
distress?" 

Edmund, more composed than his little 
companion, proceeded to inform his 
mother, that as Mary and himself were 
busy in coUeding plants and flowers, 
they had seen a gentleman at some 
distance on horseback; that as he ap- 
proached them, his horse had started at 
a deer which crossed his road, and 
thrown his rider on the stump of a pol- 
lard, where he was lying, motionless, 
and he believed dead. '* John," added 
the little boy, '^ s^id he would stay by 

VOL, I. C 



[ 26 ] 

the gentleman, if we would go and ask 
you what was to be done ; so y^^hilst I 
went to the brook to get some water in 
my hat to wash the poor man's temples, 
i\Iary ran forwards to find you. But 
why, Mary, did you frighten mamma, 
by making her think that I was hurt?" 
* I did not mean to frighten her, indeed,' 
replied i\Iary, ' but I was so frightened 
m3\self, that I did not know what I said. ' 
^^ You are not to blame, my sweet love," 
said Mrs. Herbert, kissing her; '^^ may 
you, my dear children, be never less alive 
to the sweet feelings of compassion and 
humanity, than you have shewn your- 
selves this evening. But let us hasten 
to administer what relief we can to this 
unfortunate person." Thus sa}'ing, she 
struck into the path pointed out by 
the children, and soon saw, a little before 
her, a man of genteel appearance just 
rising from thd ground, and supported 
by the servant's arm. 



[ 27 ] 

His head was inclined towards the 
ground, and his face turned from Mrs. 
Herbert, who approached him quickly, 
and in a voice of compassionate sweet- 
ness and kind solicitude, expressed her 
'^ hope that he had not received any 
material injury from the accident." 

' Merciful Providence!' exclaimed the 
stranger, as he threw his glance towards 
the speaker, ' that well-known voice! I 
cannot be deceived ! No, it is indeed 
my Caroline!' 

^' Henry, my dear, my long-lost 
Henry!" faintly articulated Mrs. Her- 
bert, and in a moment found herself 
encircled by the arms of that affection- 
ate brother, Avhom ,'she had been taught 
to consider as for ever lost. 

To describe the feelings by which her 
Uosom was agitated at this unlooked-for 
meeting, is not within the power of lan- 
guage: they were too tumultuous for 
description, too mixed for definition. — 
c 2 



I 28 ] 

As soon however as they had subsided 
sufficiently to allow her fully to compre- 
hend the extent of her happiness, she 
lifted her heart and eye to heaven in 
grateful praise for the event, and tenderly 
embracing her brother, assured him of the 
inexpressible joy which she experienced 
at this unhoped-for blessing; calling at 
the same time to the children, who stood 
fixed in silent wonder at the scene, to run 
to their vmcle and welcome his return. 

Henry took IMary and Edmund alter- 
nately in his arms, and as he kissed their 
rosy cheeks, while the tears coursed each 
other down his OAvn, Mrs. Herbert had 
leisure to mark the alteration in that 
countenance, which in happier days had 
beamed with the animated glow of youth, 
and health, and ardent hope. His eye 
had lost its lustre, his face was pale and 
emaciated, and wore the marks of sick- 
ness and of sorrow. But the expression 
of eweetncss, which had been refleded 



[ 29 ] 

upon Ills countenance from bis niincf, 
still remained : his impassioned manner, 
his affectionate sensibility, were still the 
same: the well-known tone (A his me- 
lodious voice could not be mistaken, 
it spoke at once to her beart, awakening* 
a thousand painful and dangerous asso- 
ciations; associations which it required 
all the self-command of i\Irs. Herbert to 
endure without ao'onisino^ emotion. 

The evening was now fast closing-, 
and John, whose absence had not before 
been noticed, presently appeared with 
intellio-ence that ^' the carriao-e waited 
at the edge of the wood;" which this 
faithful creature had run to the Lodge 
to order, the moment he discovered who 
the stranger was. Henry gladly availed 
himself of this conveyance, as violent 
pain and loss of blood had rendered him 
incapable of again mounting his horse, 
which was found quietly grazing in the 
neighbourhood of the accident. When 



r so ] 

they arrived at the Lodge, Mrs. Herbert 
immediately dispatched a messenger for 
medical assistance, from the adjacent 
town; and having seen her brother 
laid upon a sopha in a darkened room, 
she left him to repose, retiring into her 
chamber to tranquillize her own bosom 
after the interesting adventure which 
had just befallen her. 

On examining his patient, Mr. — * 
pronounced the contusion on his head to 
be a slight one, but that his pulse indi- 
cated a degree of feverish irritability 
Vv'hich required the utmost quiet; and 
having bled him copiously, and given 
the necessary directions, he quitted the 
Lodge, Vvith a promise of returning early 
on the following day. 

When alone with his sister, Henry 
seemed desirous of entering into some 
explanation of the circumstances which 
had led to his unexpected appearance in 
the forest; but the strong emotions which 



i. 31 ] 

agitated Iiis debilitated frame whilst at- 
tempting the task, excited such alarming 
apprehensions for his safety in Mrs. 
Herbert, as induced her peremptorily to 
to insist on his silence in this respc6i, 
though her bosom throbbed v.ith the 
most anxious curiosity to be made ac • 
quainted v;ith the particulars of his 
history. She entreated, therefore, that 
he would defer ail explanation till he 
should be more equal to tlic Cvcrtion, 
and recommended in the mean time, a 
stri(5l attention to the directions of Mr. 
, from whose medical skill, she flat- 
tered herself with every hope of his 
speedy restoration. 

^' Ah, my dear Caroline," returned 

Henry, *' the skill of Mr. may 

relieve my bodily pain, but who shall 
administer to a miJid diseased?' His 
agonized look, the heart-piercing tone 
of his voice, and the emotion with which 
he uttered these word?, entirely over- 



[ 32 J 

powered the sensibility of Mrs. Herbert, 
who, unable longer to support herself, 
sunk on her knees beside the sofa, whilst 
the long-suppressed tear fell fast upon the 
feverish hand of Henry, which pressed 
his sister's Avith a convulsive force. 

For a moment both were silent; at 
length, *' I see I distress you, my dear 
Caroline," resumed Henry, '^ and I 
acknowledge I am much to blame; yet 
when you know what I have endured — 
But will not J/o^^ also disown the wretched 
Henry ?" * Disown thee ! dearest, ear- 
liest friend of my heart! No, witness for 
me, heaven, that the image of my brother 
has never, from the first moment of our 
separation, been absent from my mind.' 
*' Then," replied Henry, '^ am I not 
entirely bereaved. O, teach me. Father 
of mercy, to be grateful for thy good- 
ness, in thus pouring upon my festered 
spirit the cordial drop of a sister's affec- 
tion to soothe those sorrows which can 



r 33 ] 

never be removed. And you also," he 
added, after a pause, " you also, my 
dearest Caroline, have suffered by the 
same hand which blasted all my peace ! 
Yet you have comforts in your children^ 
which I can never know. Edmund 
indeed is a noble boy — but his unworthy 

father " ' Is my husband, Henry.' 

^' True, true, my sister! But, ah! how 
little does he merit that sacred name. 
Alas! unfortunate, ill-requited Fairford P* 
* Brother!' cried Mrs. Herbert, in an 
impressive tone. ^' Forgive me," re- 
turned Henry, *^ forgive the ravings of 
a wretch, whose feelings have been tor- 
tured even to madness! Great heaven, 
does there exist in nature such another 
villain as him, who with more than 
daemon's rage has thus contrived to ruin 
all our hope of happiness? Oh, Caroline, 
when I contemplate you as the vi(51im of 
his cruelty, and recollect also that by 
his machinations / have been deprived 



[ 34 J 

of all my soul held dear, my love, my 
Tv'ife, my promised offspring !" convul- 
sive sobs prevented further utterance; 
oppressed by the violence of his feel- 
ings, Henry sunk into his sister's arms, 
and wept aloud. 

It was some time before Mrs. Herbert 
succeeded in her efforts to ca.lm the agi- 
tated spirits of her unfortunate brother; 
and when at length, soothed by her 
tender sympathy, he seemed to be in 
some degree composed, in order to pre- 
vent his mind from reverting to the 
agonizing recollection of his own suffer- 
ings, she told him, that, if agreeable to 
him, she would relate the incidents which 
had occurred to herself during the long 
period of their separation from each 
other; exacting in return a recital of 
his own story, as soon as his strength 
was sufficiently restored to enable him 
to communicate it without danger to 
his health. Henry gratefully accepted- 



[ 35 ] 

her offer, and Mrs. Herbert commenced 
her history, but as from fear of Avound- 
ing the irritable feelings of her auditor, 
she suppressed many distressing circum- 
stances, and only slightly sketched 
others, which we consider of sufficient 
interest to lay before our readers, we 
must request their attention to a few 
pages of retrospedion, whilst we trace 
the fortunes of this amiable woman from 
her birth to the present time.

CHAPTER II. 



SIR Gilbert Fitzmordaimt, the father 
of Mrs. Herbert, had, rather at an 
advanced period of life, married a very 
young lady, of exquisite beauty, but 
of birth and fortune far inferior to 
his own. Nor did either the talents or 
acquirements of Miss Morton at all equal 
her personal attractions. Her disposi- 
tion, however, was amiable, her temper 
serene, her manners gentle; and although 
an humble education had denied her 
many of those advantages, which might 



[ 37 ] 

have added lustre to that rank in which 
she was placed by her marriage with Sir 
Gilbert, yet neither malice nor envy 
could discover any blemish in the cha- 
ra6ler or condud of the lovely Lady 
Fitzmordaunt. 

Confident of possessing the undivided 
affe6lion of a husband, whom she sin- 
cerely loved: surrounded by all that 
affluence could bestow; she for a time 
believed her happiness must be as lasting 
as she felt it to be complete ; nor was it 
till after the birth of a little girl, that 
Lady Fitzmordaunt perceived in Sir Gil- 
bert's negle6l of the infant, and coldness 
towards herself, on how capricious and 
unreasonable a being that felicity de- 
pended, of which she had flattered her- 
self she was so secure. 

By this baronet, who traced a long 
line of ancestry back to Norman times, 
a son, a male heir, through whom his 
name, his manors, and hereditary ho- 



[ 38 ] 

Hours should be transmitted to posterity, 
was an acquisition indispensable to his 
happiness; and a disappointment in this 
point was considered by him as a mis- 
fortune of such magnitude as no other 
advantages could compensate. 

Lady Fitzmordaunt was most painfully 
affeded by the undisguised chagrin of 
a husband, to ensure whose felicity she 
would gladly have made any sacrifice. 
To anticipate his wishes had ever been 
her study; to conform to his opinions, 
her invariable rule. It is not surprising, 
therefore, that she should insensibly 
adopt his sentiments on this subject, and 
without losing the feelings of a fond and 
affe6lionate mother, sometimes feel regret 
that her infant had not been of the sex 
most agreeable to the inclinations of Sir 
Gilbert. 

In the course of two years her Lady- 
ship's situation gave rise to the hope that 
the fond wishes of Sir Gilbert might at 



[ 39 ] 

length be gratified. During this period 
of expectation, the small-pox proved 
fatal to the little girl. The mother's 
grief upon the occasion was sincere and 
poignant; but the only observation that 
escaped the lips of Sir Gilbert, was, 
*' Thank heaven, I have not lost a son." 
It will therefore be easily imagined that 
his joy was unbounded, when, on return- 
ing from a successful ele6lion, which had 
detained him several weeks from home, 
he found Lady Fitzmordaunt nearly re- 
covered from her confinement, and folded 
to his bosom the heir he had so anxiously 
desired. 

The birth of this precious gift of hea- 
ven, was celebrated through the manor 
with every mark of rejoicing and festi- 
vity; and a large circle of elegant guests 
within the castle, partook of all the 
luxuries that money could purchase, 
and of every entertainment which taste 
could suggest. 



[ 40 ] 

Lady Fltzmordaunt, indeed, did not 
appear to enter into these amusements 
with a spirit and satisfa6lion equal to 
Sir Gilbert's; but her languor and indif- 
ference were naturally enough attributed 
by those who remarked them, to the 
usual effefts of her present situation; 
and the greater number of the guests 
were far too busily employed in amusing 
themselves, to be very anxious or very 
curious about the feelings of others. 

For more than two years the little 
Charles (for such was his name) re- 
mained the sole darling of the family ; 
idolized by his father, and caressed by 
every dependent who sought to recom- 
mend himself to Sir Gilbert's notice. 
Lest his temper should be hurt by con» 
tradition, every whim was ordered to be 
gratified as soon as expressed. Caprices 
multiplied with encouragement; and 
an ill judged uninterrupted indulgence 
sowed the seeds of every corrupt and 



. [ 41 ] 

fatal passion, in that period of childhood 
when the du6lile mind is most capable 
of receiving indelible impressions. 

Lady Fitzmordaunt saw the danger of 
this condii 6t, but her attempts to clieck 
it were vain. Her own education, in- 
deed, had been plain and simple, but it 
had given her that knowledge which is 
most useful for the condu6l of life. She 
had been early taught, and experience 
also had confirmed the remark, that 
ornamental acquirements are of less 
importance than good dispositions, and 
that the improvement of the mind con- 
sists in the regulation of the passions, 
in the establishment of virtuous habits, 
and in the cultivation of the rational 
powers, rather than in the attainment 
of languages, or the acquisition of polite 
accomplishments. She secretly grieved 
to observe that Charles, unused to con- 
troul, or impatient of any hesitation in 
complying with his wishes, every day 



[ 42 3 

increased in seliishness and ill-huniour; 
v,hilst, on the other hand, his doating 
father regarded him Avith fresh delight, 
considering his bursts of passion as in- 
dications of spirit, and his perverseness 
and obstinacy as certain prognostics of 
manly firmness. 

Shortly after Charles had completed 
his second year, Lady Fitzmordaunt be- 
came the mother of twins; and as little 
Henry and his sister Caroline were pre- 
sented to their father to receive his 
paternal blessing, she smilingly observed, 
that ' although one of them happened 
unfortunately to be a female, she still 
hoped they would be equal sharers in 
Sir Gilbert's affection.' 

The baronet coldly embracing the 
little innocents, replied with indiffer- 
ence, ^' my anxieties in that respe6t, my 
love, were relieved on the birth of our 
elder son. While he is preserved to me, 
I shall feel no solicitude as to the sex of 



r 43 ] 

another child. I ah-eady contemplate 
in him the spirited heir to my title, tlic 
liberal possessor of my estates, and the 
worthy representative of my ancient 
house, and can consequently regard 
any other addition to our family with 
only a secondary aifection." 

' Secondary, Sir Gilbert; these sweet 
babes only secondary;' replied Lady Fitz- 
mordaunt, pressing the infants to her 
bosom. ' Indeed, if you would listen 
to me patiently, I could convince you — I 
could give such reasons why Charles — ' 
'' You never loved him," hastily inter- 
rupted the Baronet; '^ I have frequently 
suspecled it; I have often seen it." 
Lady Fitzmordaunt made an effort to 
speak, but he continued ; '^ If^ however, 
yoii love vie, Harriet, (she tenderly 
pressed his hand,) remember, that the 
child who possesses my affections, should 
be as dear to you as to myself.*' 



[ 44 ] 

As the children advanced in years, 
it became evident that the partialities 
of tlieir parents operated in diferent 
dire6tions. 

Lady Fitzmordannt's preference for 
the twins could not be mistaken; which, 
though it was condemned by many of 
her friends, yet found some excuse in 
the opinion of others, from their superior 
claims to affedion, as well as the injus- 
tice of Sir Gilbert in entirely neglecting 
them, whilst he lavished the most ex- 
travagant marks of fondness on the 
elder boy. 

Thus were the seeds of family discord 
sown, and the foundation laid of all the 
evils which occurred to them in subse- 
quent life. Indulged and encouraged in 
every caprice by his father; flattered by 
the servants, and contradicled only by 
Lady Fitzmordaunt; the young heir early 
lost all filial regard for his mother, and 
affeftion for the twins, whom he consi- 



[ 45 3 

dered as his rivals in her tenderness. 
He soon became the little tyrant of the 
nursery, where his principal pleasure was 
derived from disturbing the peace of the 
younger children by destroying their 
play-things; whilst out of doors he de- 
lighted himself with inflicting tortures 
on insects, or teazing any animals that 
came in his way. It was to this season 
of life that the formation of Charles's 
future chara6ler might be traced. It 
was now that his mind imbibed those 
principles of a disposition imperious, 
selfish, and vindi6live, which afterwards 
became a curse to himself, and the 
source of unhappiness to all connected 
with him. 

Henry and his sister in the mean time, 
under the attentive eye of their mother, 
grew up with every valuable trait of 
chara6ler. Mild and gentle herself, she 
instilled into their bosoms all the softer 
virtues. By a constant endeavour to 



[ 46 3 

prevent all unnecessary occasions of irri- 
tation, she guarded them from peevish- 
ness or passion. By denying them no 
proper indulgence, and uniformly refu^ 
sing to grant any that was otherwise, 
she at once ensured their afFe(5iion, and 
planted the germ of a satisfied and con- 
tented disposition. It required, indeed, 
all her vigilance and discretion to coun- 
teract the dangerous example of their 
violent and self-willed brother, and the 
injudicious conduct of Sir Gilbert, who 
was ever loud in his praises of Charles, 
and frequently drew mortifying compa- 
risons between that spirited lad, and the 
sheepish dulness of his brother and sister. 
But a steady and consistent condu6l in 
herself, added to an unremitting atten- 
tion to the cultivation of all the amiable 
dispositions of the mind, secured the 
children from any dangerous impres- 
sions, and formed in them habits of 
piety and virtue. 



[ 47 J 

As the young people advanced in life, 
the effects of the different systems under 
which they had been early educated, 
were strikingly displayed. Charles and 
Henry were sent to Westminster and 
the University, where the former became 
the terror of those over whom he had any 
power; hated or scorned by his equals; 
prodigal when his own gratification was 
the obje6t, mean where self-indulgence 
was not concerned; insensible to every 
humane feeling or compassionate emo- 
tion, and destitute of every generous 
and truly honourable principle. 

Henry, on the contrary, enjoyed the 
sincerest attachment of his fellow-stu- 
dents. His heart glowed with generosity 
and affection . He freely shared with his 
his school-mates the presents occasion- 
ally received from his mother ; assisted 
them in their exercises; and often took 
upon himself the punishment of another's 
fault. His little purse was open to the 



r 48 ] 

call of distress, and his heart melted at 
the tale of woe. 

AVhen Charles had completed his 
twentieth year, a relation of Sir Gilbert's, 
having occasion to pass some months on 
the Continent, invited the young men 
to accompany him, and the long vaca- 
tion having just commenced, the baronet 
made no objection to the proposal. Du- 
ring their absence. Lady Fitzmordaunt 
was attacked by a slight indisposition, 
for which the Bath waters were pre- 
scribed. To this place of fashionable 
resort, Caroline accompanied hermother, 
where they expe6led to be joined by Sir 
Gilbert, as soon as he had transacted 
some business which detained him in 
town. But the pleasure which Caroline 
bad anticipated from the novelty of the 
scene, and the benefit Lady Fitzmordaunt 
had expected from the salubrious springs, 
v/ere alike disappointed ; for they had 
scarcely recovered from the fatigue of 



[ ^9 ] 

their journey, when an express arrived 
with the alarming intelligence, that Sir 
Gilbert had been seized with a dangerous 
ilhiess, and earnestly desired the imme- 
diate attendance of his wife and dauo'hter. 

The summons was instantly obeyed ; 
but though she travelled with all possible 
diligence, Lady Fitzmordaunt arrived 
only in time to receive the last sigh and 
farewell look of her dying husband. The 
illness of Sir Gilbert had been a para- 
lytic seizure, which from the first excited 
apprehensions of a fatal termination. 
Being conscious of his danger, he made 
several eiforts both to write and didate 
a will, but his characters were unintel- 
ligible, and his words inarticulate ; he 
died therefore intestate, leaving Henry 
and Caroline almost wholly dependent 
on the young heir. 

The death of Sir Gilbert was a circum- 
stance very highly distressing to his 
\ridow. She fondly loved her husband; 

VOL. T. D 



[ 50 ] 

and in one of those delusions of the ima- 
gination which affeclion is so apt to 
create, she persuaded herself that if she 
had not quitted him, her watchful ten- 
derness might have warded off the dread- 
ful stroke; and prolonged a life so 
valuable to herself, and so important to 
her darling children. She saw herself 
reduced in a moment from a state of 
affluence to a very slender jointure, and 
(which was still more affli6Live to her) 
Henry and his sister depriv^ed of all 
expectation of further provision than 
her own trifling fortune of one thousand 
pounds, (settled at her marriage upon 
the younger children;) and thus placed 
in a state of dependence on one who 
had never shared her aifedions, and who 
certainly merited neither her confidence 
nor esteem. 

From this period grief seemed to take 
entire possession of Lady Fitzmordaunt's 
Blind. She gradually sunk into a state 



[ 51 ] 

of the deepest dejeftion, and her health, 
which had previously been delicate, now 
visibly and rapidly declined. 

The sudden and unexpeOled death of 
Sir Gilbert seemed for a time, to have 
made some favourable impressions upon 
the heart of the young baronet, who, 
with his brother, had been recalled from 
the Continent on tliis mournful occasion. 
Towards Henry and Caroline, his con- 
dud and expressions were, if not affec- 
tionate, at least less haughty than before; 
and the external marks of respe6l which 
he seemed disposed to pay to Lady Fitz- 
mordaunt, might have been construed 
into a desire of attempting to conciliate 
her regard, and to atone for past mis- 
condud. She received, however, all his 
advances with coldness, and was evi- 
dently pained even by his society. Her 
languor and melancholy daily increased; 
some secret sorrow seemed to weigh down 
her spirits, which undermined her consti- 
D 2 



[ 52 3 

tution, and at length produced complaints 
that baffled all the efforts of the faculty 
to remove. 

In a few months Clifton was prescribed 
as a last resource for the deep dechne 
which now preyed upon the vitals of Lady 
Fitzmordaunt, Avhither she removed ac- 
companied by Caroline. In a few days 
the symptoms prognosticated a speedy 
termination of her sorrows and sufferings; 
and being made acquainted with her situ- 
ation, she expressed an earnest desire im- 
mediately to see her sons. Henry obeyed 
the summons with mournful eagerness; 
^vhileSir Charles appeared to be perfe(5lly 
indifferent to the event of a journey, 
which, however, he could not with any de- 
gree of decency refuse to undertake. On 
their arrival, which had been impatiently 
expe6l:ed by Caroline, she threw herself 
into Henry's arms, while tears of anguish 
gushed from her eyes, and exclaimed, 
'* Alas! my brothers, I fear it is too late ; 



[ 53 ] 

our beloved mother — " * Is Lady Fitz- 
mordaunt dead?' interrupted Sir Charles: 
whilst Henry in silent grief pressed his 
sister to his bosom. '* She is not dead," 
resumed Caroline, ^' but from her sudden 
starts, and incoherent wanderings, it is 
evident her reason is disturbed. Her 
mind seems to be heavily oppressed by 
some hidden cause of agitation. Your 
name is often repeated by her, Sir 
Charles; but the sentences are so uncon- 
ne6led, that 1 have never been able dis- 
tindly to understand the purport of them. 
Yet I think that you — " * Do you mean 
to insinuate that I am the cause as well 
as the subject of her ravings;' said Sir 
Charles fiercely: * she never loved me 
as a mother; how then could she expert 
from me the respecl and aft'eclion of 
a son r' 

*' For heaven's sake," said Henr}^ 
'* recur not now to what is passed. Let 
us mutually strive to soothe our dying 



[ 54 ] 

parent, instead of embittering her last 
moments by reviving animosities which 
ought to be buried in eternal oblivion." 
At this moment a servant entering to 
inform them that Lady Fitzmordaunt 
requested their immediate attendance, 
the brothers followed Caroline in silence 
to her room. 

Sir Charles and Henry approached the 
death-bed of their mother with very 
painful but very opposite emotions. 
Although pale and emaciated, the coun- 
tenance of Lady Fitzmordaunt still re- 
tained traces of its former beauty; and 
Henr}' discovered in it the most aife6ting 
pi6lure of maternal tenderness ; whilst 
his brother, on the contrary, conscious 
how little he merited her love, fancied 
that he read in the expression of her 
languid yet lovely features, only bitter 
reproaches for his past undutiful conduct. 

As they drew nearer to the bed, Lady 
Fitzmordaunt gazed on each with wild 



[ 55 ] 

affright. A slight hectic for a moment 
tinged her cheeks, and was as suddenly 
succeeded by a pallid hue, which seemed 
to be the pi'elude of death. — Henry 
pressed her hand, and bathed it with 
his tears; when seeming to awaken to 
recolledion, she looked on him with 
transport, attempted to raise herself from 
the pillow, and stretched forth her arms, 
as if to clasp him in her bosom. But 
the effort w^as ineffectual, she sunk back 
exhausted, faintly murmuring — '' My 
son, my darling o?ilj/ son!"' Henry 
gently supported his dying parent, and 
bending forward, tenderly kissed her 
parched lips, -whilst her eyes were still 
fixed wistfully on his face, and his hand 
was locked within her own. 

'' And am I to be a cypher here?" said 
Sir Charles, in a tone of anger and mor- 
tification. At the sound of his voice. 
Lady Fitzmordaunt started; but he con- 
tinued, ^' Has your eldest child no claim 



[ S6 J 

upon your justice or your love? Is 
Charles entirely forgotten ?" ' Away 1 
away !' cried Lady Fitzmordaunt, with 
a look full of horror, and in a tone of 
agony. * My soul is tortured by the re- 
collection; — it cannot be — Charles, you 
are no child of mine!' *' How have 1 
merited this cruel treatment?" returned 
Sir Charles, with indignation. — A violent 
hysterical seizure prevented her reply, 
and obliged the young men to resign 
their parent to the care of the attend- 
ants, whilst they retired to an adjoining 
chamber, where the baronet sat in sullen 
silence, whilst Henry endeavoured to 
soothe the affliclion of his sister, and 
inspire her with fortitude in this hour 
of trial. 

Tliey had remained in this situation a 

considerable time, when a mjcssage came 

to Sir Charles, that Lady Fitzmordaunt, 

finding herself restored to perfe<?l com- 

osure, requested to see him alo?w. He 



[ 57 ] 

seemed surprized at the summons, and 
reluctantly followed the messenger. 

Henry and his sister sat for som.e time 
impatiently waiting either his return, or 
a message for them also to go to their 
mother; but nearly an hour having- 
elapsed, and nothing transpired from the 
sick room, they stole softly to the door 
of the apartment, and quietly opening- 
it, entreated to be admitted. Sir Charles, 
however, made a sign for them not ta 
enter, and stepping forwards, said, in a 
whisper to Henry, '' Let us not be inter- 
rupted; I have a long account to settle,. 
much to ask forgiveness for ; and would 
willingly make my peace with my parent 
before I bid her a last adieu." 

Mournfully retiring from the door,. 
Henry and his sister passed another half 
hour in anxious suspense, but at length 
unable longer to endure this banisliment 
from their expiring parent, they again 
opened the door of her chamber, and 



r 58 ] 

abruptly, but without noise, entered the 
room. Sir Charles, who was pacing it 
in the utmost agitation, turned pale as 
death at their intrusion, and casting a 
fierce and inquisitive glance towards the 
bed, rushed hastily by them, and retired 
without speaking. 

Already the cold damps of death hung 
on the brow of Lady Fitzmordaunt. Her 
glazed eyes sought in vain to distinguish 
the objects near her. Her lips moved, 
but speech was denied. Caroline and 
Henry dropped on their knees beside the 
bed, and grasping the clay-cold hands 
of their beloved parent, hung over her 
in deep but silent sorrow. An attendant 
offered some restoratives, but it was too. 
late. Nature was exhausted. Every 
moment she breathed with greater diffi- 
culty, and before midnight ceased to. 
breathe at all. 

The grief of Henry and his sister was 
truly '' a sorrow of the soul/' They 



[ ■'■>9 1 

loved their mother with the truest fihal 
affection, the grateful return of unin- 
terrupted maternal tenderness. Their 
father's death had afilided them, but the 
grief they then felt was light when com- 
pared with their present anguish. The 
magnitude of their loss seemed wholly 
to occupy their minds, and left no room 
for the subordinate consideration of 
the forlorn and destitute situation to 
which they were now reduced ; till the 
hauglit}^ behaviour of Sir Charles awa- 
kened them to all the horrors of depend-* 
ence, and convinced them, that however 
deeply they had been aitlicted by the 
loss of their lamented parent, that afflic- 
tion was still capable of increase from 
the unnatural conduct of their only sur- 
viving protector. 

Scarcely were the remains of the late 
Lady Fitzmordaunt committed to the 
tomb, when Sir Charles, throwing oif all 
restraint, appeared as the proud tyrant 



[ 60 ] 

of his little lioushold. To Henry his be- 
haviour became daily more cold, distant, 
and imperious. He not unfrequently 
hinted the impropriety of his return to 
Oxford, as a situation of ex pence ill- 
suited to the fortune of a younger bro- 
ther; and at length, though not without 
some expressions of aife6led regret at his 
inability to provide for him more eligibly, 
proposed to procure for him a subordi- 
nate situation in one of the public offices. 
Sir Charles had anticipated the eifeds 
Avhich such an offer as this would pro- 
duce. The spirit of Henry revolted 
from any obligation bestowed by one 
who seemed so little inclined to consult 
his delicacy as a man, or his feelings as 
a brother; and having, through the 
interest of a friend of his mother's, ob- 
tained a pair of colours in the 

regiment, then on foreign service, he 
resolved to find for himself a path to 
independence. Bound to his sister by 



[ 61 ] 

the ties of kindred virtues, as well as of 
natural affedion, he would gladly have 
rescued her also from this cruel bondage; 
but he had his own fortune to seek, and 
could bestow nothing on Caroline, as he 
bade her adieu, but fervent ineiFe6lual 
wishes for some happier lot. 

Miss Fitzmordaunt, though as noble- 
minded, amiable, and ingenuous, as her 
twin-brother, felt however less keenly 
than him the bitterness of dependence; 
which indeed would seldom have occurred 
to her mind, had it not too often been 
pressed upon her recollection by the 
capricious condu6l of the unfeeling ba- 
ronet. Occasionally, perhaps, beseemed 
disposed to behave to her, if not with 
aifeftion, at least with less arrogance 
than had marked his condu6l to Henry; 
but these flashes of softness in his man- 
ner were transient and infrequent, and 
seemed to be wrung from him by the 
unifoi-m sweetness of her disposition, 



t 62 ] 

rather than any kind sensibilities in his 
own heart. 

Still, however, Caroline, artless and 
innocent herself, was, with the natural 
hilarity of youth, disposed to enjoy the 
sweets of a life in which she was just 
entering, instead of seeking its bitters, 
and submitted without repining to her 
fate; endeavouring with grateful solici- 
tude to cultivate the affection of Sir 
Charles, who daily seized some opportu- 
nity of magnifying the obligations with 
which he favoured her. The loss of 
Henry's society was a severe drawback 
upon her little sum of happiness; but she 
strove to conceal the regret she felt at 
his departure, lest it should be under- 
stood as a reproach for that harshness 
-which had driven him an exile from his 
home; and though many wxre the tears 
of sorrow vdiich she shed in silentsolitude 
over his absence, yet she dressed hev 



[ 63 ] 

features in their sweetest smiles, wlieii- 
ever Sir Charles appeared. 

But though she was aware that her 
brother possessed the power and had too 
much the inclination, to render her situ- 
ation uncomfortable, she had as yet no 
idea that he could make her miserable. 
She had j^et to learn how far his cruelty 
extended. 

A splendid entertainment had been 
long planned for the celebration of the 
day on which Sir Charles Fitzmordaunt 
attained his one and twentieth year. 
The guests were numerous, and Caroline 
exerted herself to do honour to the fes- 
tival. Youth and innocence disposed 
her to enjoy the mirthful scene. The 
gaiety of her heart shone in her expres- 
sive features. Never had she appeared 
more enchantingly lovely. Even Sir 
Charles, relaxing from his frigid dignity^ 
condescended to compliment her on her 



[. 64 ] 

appearance, in warmer terms than she 
had before heard escape from his lips. 

Caroline felt gratified by her brother's 
approbation, and received the general 
homage paid to her charms with inge- 
nuous pleasure, but without expressing 
or evincing the most distant degree of 
vanity or afPe6tation ; nor when Sir 
Charles introduced to her particular 
notice, the handsomest and most elegant 
man in the room, did she consider it 
as a circumstance of sufficient import- 
ance, either, to increase her present 
gratification, or to influence in the 
slightest way her future happiness. The 
pointed manner of its introduction lost 
its intended effe^, by escaping her no- 
tice; neither did she remark the signifi- 
cant expression of the baronet's features, 
when, on naming Mr. Herbert as his 
highly-valued friend, he bade her re- 
member that he should estimate her 
desire to please himself, by the compla- 



[ 63 3 

cency with which she received the at- 
tentions of his o'uest. 

This was a sufficient inducement to 
Caroline to endeavour to render herself 
agreeable to Air. Pierbert; an endeavour 
in wliich indeed she was but too suc- 
cessful. He solicited the honour of her 
hand in the dance, an accomplishment 
in which he eminently excelled. Every 
movement of Caroline's was ease and 
grace, and animated by the novelty of 
the occasion, she shone with more than 
common lustre. Herbert, wl^o was form- 
ed for scenes like these, caught addi- 
tional inspiration from the charms of his 
lovely partner. They were of course 
admired by the company, and Sir Charles 
secretly hoped they equally admired 
each other. But the animation of Caro- 
line was the natural effusion of an inno- 
cent and cheerful heart; whilst that of 
her partner arose from a combination of 



r (^G ] 

feelings, of which her pure mind was 
entirely ignorant. 

Herbert's vanity, the prominent fea- 
ture of his character, immediately inter- 
preted Miss Fitzmordaunt's ready com- 
pliance with her brother's directions for 
the regulation of her behaviour towards 
him, into a sudden prepossession in his 
own favour. Presuming on this opinion, 
which he did not hesitate to believe was 
fully justified by his transcendant merit, 
he gradually assumed such an air of 
confidence when addressing her, and 
poured such torrents of compliments 
into her ear, that Caroline, displeased 
and disgusted at a condu6l which she 
considered rather as an affront to her 
understanding than a tribute to her 
charms, secretly but earnestly Avished, 
w^hen they separated at the conclusion 
of the evening, she might never be so 
unfortunate as to meet with him again. 



[ C7 ] 

Sir Charles, on the contrary, who had 
attentively observed both, remarked with 
infinite satisfaction the favourable im- 
pression made by liis sister on the heart 
of his friend; and tliough he did not 
draw exactly the same inference from 
the invariable sweetness of her m.anner 
towards Herbert, as he liimself had done, 
yet not having been able to discover in 
Caroline's behaviour, any symptoms of 
disapprobation, he was very far from 
suspecting her real sentiments on the 
subjed; and congratulated himself on 
the success of a plan, which his earnest 
desire of being freed from the incum- 
brance of Caroline had often suggested 
to his mind. His disappointment and 
chagrin was extreme therefore, when on 
the following morning, whilst talking 
with his sister on the events of the pre- 
ceding day, he enquired her opinion of 
i\Ir. Herbert, and found it to be in dire6l 
opposition to his hopes and expectations. 



[ 68 ] 

She had not intended indeed to have 
hazarded oifending the baronet by na- 
ming his friend at all; but called upon 
as she was for her sentiments of him, 
she could not deny that she had thought 
him vain, presumptuous, and superficial. 
** He is extremely handsome, Caro- 
line." * Perhaps so; but in my opinion, 
not equally agreeable.' 'Mle is univer- 
sally considered as elegant and fashion- 
able; indeed as the perfe6l model of a 
finished gentleman." H^ue, Sir Charles, 
but the line polish of his manners ren- 
ders him too brilliant for my sober taste; 
and I confess, that what greater con- 
noisseurs in the science of good breed- 
ing might perhaps consider as easy 
elegance, appears to me to be downright 
impertinence.' ^^ You are witty at the 
expence of candour;" returned the ba- 
ronet, with a frown which made his 
sister tremble. *' This is the first time 
I have heard Herbert mentioned in any 



[ 69 ] 

other terms than those of the warmest 
approhation. However," added he in a 
more conciliatory tone, " when you have 
seen more of him, I doubt not that you 
will find reason to alter your opinion.'* 

From this penod Mr. Herbert became 
a constant visiter at the Castle, nor could 
Caroline long remain ignorant that she 
was the magnet which drew him thither. 
Time, however, failed to verify Sir 
Charles's predidion. The dislike she 
had conceived at her first meeting with 
him, was rather increased than dimi- 
nished by the opportunities she now had 
of more nearly observing his character 
and disposition; and her behaviour to 
him in consequence of it assumed daily 
more distance and reserve. But no cold- 
ness of manner could check the preten- 
sions of one, who felt persuaded that he 
was irresistible; and who attributed Miss 
Fitzmordaunt's change of behaviour to 
modest diffidence, and the natural cm- 



[ 70 J 

barrassment of a your.g and delicate 
mind under the influence of a first 
passion. 

Distressed by his obstinate attentions, 
and desirous of avoiding such a painfid 
persecution, Caroline had determined to 
request Sir Charles's interference on her 
behalf, "when she was prevented by his 
informing her one morning, that '^ his 
friend Herbert had made her the offer 
of his hand and fortune; an honour of 
v/hich he had pledged himself she would 
accept." 

Astonishment and horror prevented 
Miss Fitzmordaunt from making an im- 
mediate answer ; and the baronet, avail- 
ing himself of her silence, proceeded to 
descant on the merits of the gentleman, 
his taste, accomplishments, and fortune; 
and concluded with congratulating her 
on the peculiar good fortune of having 
attra6led the notice of a man, so much 
the envy of the gay world, and who 



[ 71 ] 

might at any time command tlie hands 
of women of infinitely greater preten- 
sions than a girl in her dependent situ- 
ation. '^ Bat Herbert is a noble fellow. 
He swears that with him money is no 
obje(5l. That you are handsome as an 
Houri; and he would prefer you, though 
pennyless, to an empress that could not 
boast your charms." 

A flood of tears having in some mea- 
sure relieved the painful tumults which 
the first communication of this intelli- 
gence occasioned in the bosom of Caro- 
line, she addressed her brother, and in 
the most gentle accents entreated he 
would convey her thanks to Mr. Herbert, 
but at the same time inform him, she 
must absolutely decline the honour of 
his proposals. 

'^ Decline his proposals !'' repeated the 
baronet, with a contraded brow; ^' im- 
possible ! my word is passed, and by 
heaven, you ?nust marry my friend." — 



[ 72 ] 

^ All! my dear brother,' resumed Caro- 
line, ' revoke, I beseech you, that ter- 
rible sentence: condemn me not to a 
fate so cruel r *' A cruel fate do you 
call it, to be the star of fashion, the 
admiration of the beau monde, the envy 
of your sex? To be sure, child, you who 
have not a thousand pounds in the world, 
have a great right to complain of cruelty 
when offered the command of ten thou- 
sand a year." * The cruelty of my fate, 
dear Sir Charles, would not certainly 
consist,' replied Caroline, endeavouring 
to force a smile through her tears, * in 
the circumstances you mention. I do 
not pretend to a stoicism which despises 
the advantages of fortune ,• I objed; only 
to the terrible incumbrance, which in the 
present case is attached to them.' '* Your 
sprightliness is ill-timed;" said the ba- 
ronet peevishly, *' I am serious." ' Then 
dear brother, allow me seriously to assure 
vou, that I feel I never shall be able to 



r 73 ] 

conquer my aversion to the person m 
question.' *' Young ladies attachments 
and aversions are so very flexible, Caro- 
line, and change so much with changing 
circumstances, that I have no hesitation 
in saying, you will hereafter thank me 
for having insisted at present (and I do 
very peremptorily insist) on your recei- 
ving the addresses of my friend." 

The door at this instant opened, and 
Herbert himself entered the room. 
^' Apropos," said Sir Charles, '' you are 
just arrived in time, Jack, to be your 
own advocate. I have broken the ice 
for you, and have no doubt that Caroline 
(looking strernly at her) will entertain, 
a just sense of the high compliment paid 
to our family by your proffered alliance." 
' Am I then likely to be so happy ? I\Iay 
I hope for the honour of Miss Fitzmor- 
daunt's good opinion?' said Herbert, 
throwing himself on a sopha opposite to 
a large pier-glass, which conveniently re- 

VOL. I, E 



[ 74 ] 

fle6leil his handsome fissure. Sir Charles 
was silent; and Caroline, for a moment, 
incapable of utterance. Having how- 
ever recovered herself, and assumed a 
degree of composure foreign to her 
heart, she thanked him politely for the 
compliment intended her, of which she 
begged him to believe she was fully sen- 
sible, but at the same time hoped he 
would not, on an occasion in which her 
own happiness was so deeply concerned, 
think her too explicit, when she assured 
him, she never could — she never zvould, 
accede to his proposal. ^ Upon my 
honour, this is most incomprehensible.' 
said J\Ir. Herbert, throwing his eye from 
the glass to Sir Charles. '^ By heaven," 
cried the baronet quickly, whilst passion 
flushed his face, ^^ mere coyness and 
caprice; her heart belies her declara- 
tion." ' Is it so, my angel?' returned 
the conceited lover; ^ let me at least 
indulge the dear delusion, that Herbert 



[ 75 ] 

Nvill not find you inexorable to his vows. 
In the mean time, Sir Charles, as a 
pressing engagement tears me from the 
charmer of my soul, let me commit m). 
cause to your diredion. You have a 
vhart-hlajtches bless me with your sisters 
hand. She must, she shall be happy; 
and Herbert and his bride be equally the 
envy and the admiration of every splen- 
did circle.' So savino- he arose from 
the sopha, and in spite of all Caroline's 
efforts to prevent it, imprinted a kiss on 
her hand, smiled, bowed, and quitted 
the apartment. 

** You cannot mean," said the indig- 
nant girl, as Herbert closed the door, 
*^ to unite me to that presuming, vain, 
unfeeling coxcomb ! you will not surely 
condemn your sister to so much Avretch- 
edness ! Ah, why do 3 ou wish to drive 
me from you ? Why force me to become 
the wife of a man I must despise?" 
Fitzmordaunt paused for a moment in 
E 2 



[ 76 ] 

seeming irresolution; and Caroline con- 
sidering his silence as a favourable omen, 
sunk on her knee before him. Seizing 
his hand, she bathed it with her tears, 
and in the most pathetic terms described 
the misery that must inevitably follov/ 
an union so entirely repugnant to her 
hiclinations. '^ Oblige me not to make 
this sacrifice of all my earthly happiness, 
iBy dear brotlier. Suffer me only to 
remain in my present situation, which 
I wish not to change. By the memory 
of our revered paients, I solemnly con- 
jure you — " ' Kame them not,' inter- 
rupted Fitzmordaunt, furiously, whilst 
liis face grew pale, and his lips qui- 
vered, ' Name them not, I charge 
you; with v^e their memory will avail 
nothing. My promise is given, my ho- 
nour is engaged You must become 
the wife of Herbert, or lose my favour 
and proteclioD for ever.' With these 
words he tore himself from Caroline, 



t 77 ■] 

^vlio still grasped his hand in hers, and 
rushed from the room, leaving his un- 
fortunate sister in a state of agitation 
little short of distraction. 



[ 73 ] 



CHAPTER III. 



T^7ITH fine features, a good figure, 
^ ^ a tolerable understanding, and 
polished manners, Mr. Herbert possessed 
also a large estate, and the reputation 
of liberality of sentiment, and generosity 
of principle. He was, liowever, a cox- 
comb in behaviour, and a libertine in 
heart; vain and insensible, though ele- 
gant and accomplished; mean and selfish, 
though profuse and expensive. 

As the most lovely girl he had ever 
seen. Miss Fitzmordaunt attra(?ted his 
attention : but the impression which her 



C 79 I 

charms made on his heart would not 
}ia\'e induced him to offer her his hand, 
had not his vanity been vouzed by the 
admiration which he found she excited 
in others. 

Sir Charles's beautiful sister was the 
subjeft. of every polite circle. The men^ 
swore she was an angel ; and the ladies 
strove in vain to depreciate a loveliness 
that was so universally acknowledged. 
Stimulated by these circumstances, Her- 
bert resolv^ed to possess himself of a prize 
which should at once excite the envy of 
both sexes ; and confident as he felt of 
his own merits, he doubted not that he 
should obtain the hand of Miss Fitz- 
mordaunt with the same ease that he 
might add a new horse to his stud, or a 
fresh varnish to his curricle. On the 
turf, and in the ring, he had already 
been eminently conspicuous. Herbert's 
racers and equipages, the spirit of his 
bets, and the punctuality of his hoiwur- 



[ 80 ] 

able engagements, had long been spoken 
of with eclat. He now panted for fame 
in another character, and with the same 
feelings which would have accompanied 
the pursuit of any other whim, he deter- 
mined on paying his addresses to Caro- 
line Fitzmordaunt. 

It imfortunately happened, hov»^ever, 
that during the period of their very short 
acquaintance, the lady had discovered 
more to dislike than to approve in the 
various qualifications of her lover. Al- 
though no disciple of Lavater, she yet 
possessed a sort of intuitive skill in phy- 
siognomy that compelled lier to shrink 
with disgust from the expression of fea- 
tures, which, though handsome, indica- 
ted a heart degenerate and corrupt. His 
skill in music also was highly extolled; 
but to Caroline's taste, his science was 
"unnatural refmement, and his manner 
insupportable aflfeclation. In her esti- 
mation, his ready smile was artificial 



[ 81 ] 

grimace; his elegant compliments, hy- 
perbolical flights ; and his easy air, dis- 
gusting confidence. She considered him, 
in short, as a character in which nature 
had no share; where every look, word, 
and gesture were studied to produce 
effect, and challenge applause. 

Independently, however, of these 
causes of dislike, Caroline's heart owned 
another motive forrejeding the addresses 
of Mr. Herbert: a tender preference 
ah'cady occupied it, which shut out all 
other claimants on its affeCfions. 

Frederick Fairford, the son of a cler- 
gyman, had been the schoolfellow and 
early friend of Henry Fitzmordaunt, 
Avith whom he usually passed a part of 
each vacation at Fitzmordaunt-Castle. 
This close intimacy between her favourite 
brother and young Fairford had natu- 
rally interested Caroline in his favour, 
thouQ-h the sentiment she vet cherished 
for him was not distinguishable from 



[ 82 ] 

sisterly regard. After the death of her 
parents, she saw less of Frederick, who, 
except on her account, would never have 
endured the chilling reception, which lie 
met with from the haughty baronet. 
But though they met less frequently, 
each succeeding interview became still 
more interesting than the former. Some 
latent excellence, some estimable point 
of character which she had before neg- 
le6led to discern, now presented itself to 
her observation. The sentiments con- 
ne6led with Frederick in her bosom 
assumed each day a tenderer character; 
and childish friendship rapidly matured 
into the most sincere and pure affe6lion, 
Fairford, whose temper was generous, 
whose heartwasun corrupted, had from the 
first moment of reflexion, remarked and 
admiredthe charms of MissFitzmordaunt. 
Thebeauty of her person, however, would 
not alone have captivated him, had they 
been unaccompanied with those graces 



[ 83 ] 

of the mind by which she M-as so emi- 
nently clistingLiihed. The sweetness that 
beamed in her dark hazle eye, the bhish 
that tinoed her cheek with the native 
hue of sensibihty, the inteUigence which 
illuminated every feature of her animated 
countenance, the charms of her conver- 
sation, and the innocent naivete of her 
manners; it was these which converted 
a boyish preference into ardent love, 
and confirmed in the bosom of Fairford 
an enthusiastic passion for Miss Fitz- 
mordaunt, to which he gave the most 
uncontrouled indulgence, without once 
considering the little probability of its 
being crowned with success. 

On the evening of the birth-day fete, 
Frederick w^as awakened from his dreani 
of happiness. He observed Air. Her- 
bert's pointed attentions to Caroline, and 
though jealousy made no part of lus 
character, he could not observe tliem 
with indifference. He saw also the 



r 84 ] 

pleasure with which they were encou- 
raged by Sir Charles ; and the torturing 
fears which this ominous circumstance 
suggested, were in the course of the 
evening confirmed by the baronet, who 
purposely seized an opportunity of hint- 
ing to him the views he had formed; 
artfully adding, that as a sincere friend 
of the family, he felt persuaded of Mr. 
Fairford's gratulation on this prospe6l of 
his sister's eligible establishment in life. 
' Frederick's chagrin could only be 
equalled by his surprize at this intima- 
tion. Caroline the wife of another ! 
was an idea which had never yet pre- 
sented itself to his mind ; nor did he 
immediately feel capable of clearly com- 
prehending the possibility of such an 
event ; but on recalling his scattered 
senses, he was naturally led to a more 
close investigation of his own claims to 
that felicity, to which he had thought- 
lessly, and, as he now believed, pre- 



[ 85 1 

sumptuously aspired. He drew a compa- 
rison between the birth and expedations 
of Caroline and himself, and could not 
but confess that the situation to which 
a marriage with Mr. Herbert would ele- 
vate her, was more suitable to her than 
the humble fate to which she must have 
been consigned, by an union with him- 
self. Honour forbade him to blast the 
fair prospe6ls of the woman he adored, 
by clandestinely sohciting her affedion; 
and Sir Charles had unequivocally, tho' 
indiredly given him to understand, that 
he must not hope for his approbation, or 
sanation to his pretensions. From this 
fatal evening, therefore, he resolved that 
the passion which glowed in liis bosom 
with unabated ardour, should be buried 
in etei'nal silence. But the task of con- 
cealment was, he found, more difficult 
than he had expeded; and when on 
meeting the eyes of Caroline he fancied 
they expressed the tender sentiment 



whicli in reality dwelt in her innocent 
bosom, his heart turned cold at giving 
her reason to believe, he was either in- 
sensible to the power of her charms, or 
ungrateful for the preference which she 
entertained for him; and it required all 
the united power of reason and gene- 
rosity, and every argument of his father, 
whowas the friend of his inmost thoughts, 
to prevent him from disclosing the pas- 
sion which she had excited in his breast. 
Whilst this confli6l was passing in the 
breast of Fairford, Caroline, ignorant 
of the maxims of worldly prudence, and 
unconscious of the sacrifices which are 
daily offered to the shrine of IMammon, 
saw no obstacle to oppose her future 
union with a youth to whom she had 
already given all her heart. In every 
plan which her fancy had sketched of 
domestic felicity, Fairford still was the 
principal figure on the canvass. Her 
attachment was a principle of the soul, 



[ 87 ] 

it had '^ gro^yn ^ith her growth, and 
strens-thened with her streno-th;" it 
therefore is not surprizing that she should 
consider her brother's command to ac- 
cept the proposals of Mr. Herbert, as a 
sentence which at once destroyed every 
prospe6l of worldly felicity. Whatever 
measures the deepest anguish could sug- 
gest to avert the dreaded evil, she tried, 
but tried in vain ; tears and intreaties, 
remonstrances and prayers, were equally 
ineife6lual to soften the inflexible mind 
of Sir Charles. He had resolved on the 
match, and opposition served only to 
confirm his resolution. 

Herbert also, piqued by a reludance 
which he did not expect to find, now 
considered Caroline as a necessary sacri- 
fice to his vanity. The world was not 
to know that he could be refused To 
shield himself therefore from the mor- 
tification of a defeat, he pursued his 
addresses with a persevering ardour, 



[ 88 ] 

til at bore some resemblance to a real 
passion. 

Caroline, shrinking with horror from 
the dreadful fate preparing for her, 
looked round in hopeless sorrow for some 
means of escaping its infliction. There 
were indeed moments in which she me- 
ditated flight ; but alas 1 to whom could 
she dire61; her steps? The fond and ten- 
der mother, who would joyfully have 
clasped the persecuted child to her own 
protecting bosom, was now no more ! 
Her favourite and aife6lionate Henry 
had sailed for India many months before. 
Fairford ! — but on him she durst not 
turn her thoughts. He had never in 
words disclosed the state of his heart, 
and it was possible that his speaking 
looks, his thousand soft attentions, which 
she had considered as the silent expres- 
sions of delicate love, proceeded only 
from a long and faithful friendship. 



[ 89 ] 

Fairford, indeed, had seen her reluc- 
tance to accept ^Ir. Herbert, and feeling 
himself unable longer to endure the tortu- 
ring trials to which he was daily exposed, 
he at length yielded to his father's advice, 
and tore himself from the neio'hbour- 
hood of the Castle; leaving the woman 
for whom he would freely have sacrificed 
his life, in ignorance of the noble mo- 
tives which influenced his condud. This 
desertion at such an eventful period 
confirmed Caroline in her opinion, and 
she blushed with the deepened hue of 
offended delicacy, at the idea of having 
indulged a tender preference for one, 
whose behaviour now proved that he had 
ev^er thought of her with indifference. 

In the mean time Mr. Herbert, re- 
solved not to be foiled in his plan, became 
daily more urgent in his suit. Sir Cl^arles 
also threatened to discard his sister en- 
tirely from his heart and presence, unless 
she yielded to the joint wish of himself 



[ 90 ] 

and friend. The only pittance she could 
call her own was still in his possession; 
which, insufficient as it might be for her 
maintenance, she still would have wanted 
courage to demand. Other friends than 
her brother she now had none. Her 
acguauiia?ice indeed were numerous, but 
from them she could not hope even for 
a sandion of her refusing to become the 
wife of Herbert. 

The younger females considered his 
proposals as a ground of envy • and every 
matron v/ithin the circle of her know- 
ledge, had given her to understand^ 
how highly they thought her honoured 
by his notice; how fortunate she might 
consider herself on the prospe6l of such 
an eligible establishment. 

Thus harassed incessantly by her bro* 
ther and her lover, destitute of resource 
and advice, Miss Fitzmordaunt at length 
felt herself compelled to yield in the un- 
equal struggle; and suffered them to 



[ 'J\ ] 

M'l'lng from her a sorrowful and relufiaiit 
consent. 

Having once determined on becoming 
the wife of Air. Herbert, she called to 
her aid the early lessons of piety and 
resignation which her excellent mother 
had instilled into her mind. She re- 
fle61ed also on the increased means which 
the situation she was entering into vrould 
afford her, of indulging the benevolence 
of her heart. With the natural ardour of 
a youthful imagination, she dwelt on the 
various opportunities she should then 
enjoy, of relieving distress, and dispen- 
sing comfort. She beheld misery and 
^,vant retiring from the lowly cottage 
at her approach ; and v/hilst the aged and 
infirm were cheered by her charitable 
assistance, she imagined herself encoura- 
ging industry, and diffusing knowledge, 
amongst the younger children of poverty. 

Fortified by these considerations, which 
seemed to convert the sacrifice of her 



[ 92 ] 

own inclinations into an a6t of dutj', in 
which the welfare of many others was 
concerned, she acquired firmness suffi- 
cient to accompany Sir Charles and Mi\ 
Herbert to the altar. But here the sup- 
port she expeded from her previous 
resolutions failed. When called upon 
to promise love and obedience to a man 
Avhose manners she disliked, whose cha- 
racter she could not esteem, the colour 
faded from her cheeks; in a voice tre- 
mulous and almost inarticulate, she 
pronounced her vows, and at the con- 
clusion of the ceremony sank fainting 
into her husband's arms. 

The first winter after their marriage 
was passed by Mr. and Mrs. Herbert in 
London amidst all the gaiety of fashion, 
and all the splendour of wealth ; during 
Avhich period the vanity that had influ- 
enced his choice was fully gratified, by 
the admiration which universally followed 



[ 93 ] 

Herbert's beautiful wife, whenever she 
appeared. 

The murmur of applause that buzzed 
ihrouo'h the drawino;»room on her beino- 
presented at Court, the compliments 
of gratulation poured into his ears from 
all quarter?, the ill-disguised en\T of 
the females, and the rapturous enco- 
miums lavishly bestowed on Jiis lovely 
partner by the other sex, were so many 
causes of triumph to the exulting bride- 
groom; who felt inexpressible dehght 
from the general confession of his pos- 
sessing the finest woman in the world 
of fashion. 

In compliance with the inclinations of 
her husband, Mrs. . Herbert mino-led 
indeed in all the various scenes of hio-h- 
life pleasure which he adored, and wliere 
only he was calculated to shine: but she 
** trod the mazes of folly's circle" with 
lieaviness and secret loathino- althouo*h 
no word or look marked her disappro- 



[ 9i ] 

bation. Witli the purest satisfacilon 
therefore, on the approach of the season 
when fashion's arbitrary sceptre points to 
change of situation, she heard lier hus- 
band's determination of passing the 
summer at Herbert-Lodge. It was in 
the quiet seclusion of this retreat, that 
IJrs. Herbert expected to realize those 
pleasures,, the anticipation of which had 
contributed to reconcile her to this ill- 
assorted marriage. Here the various 
plans she had formed for the exercise 
of her benevolence were to be executed. 
Here also, in the unrestrained inter- 
course of domestic privacy she hoped 
the chara6ler of her husband would more 
fully develope itself, and disclose some 
traits of virtue Avhich had been obscured 
by the parade, or silenced by the bustle, 
of a town life. 

But alas ! the wished-for removal to 
the shades of the New-Forest produced 
but little addition to the comfort of Mrs. 



[ 95 ] 

Herbert. No change of situation im- 
proved the chara6ter of Herbert in her 
opinion. Too soon she discovered that 
tlieir sentiments were not more accordant 
amid the rural scene, than in the gay 
circles of the metropohs. The beautiful 
and diversified picture of nature which 
the Lodo'c afforded, and which his ami' 
able wife contemplated with delight, 
were only beheld by Herbert with dis- 
gust and ennui. His heart, if such a 
being may be said to possess a heart, 
vibrated only to the touch of artificial 
pleasure. His taste was vitiated, and his 
mind corrupted by an early formed and 
unrestrained indulgence in habits of dis- 
sipation. The beauty of Mrs. Herbert's 
person, no longer recommended by the 
charm of novelty, ceased to attrad his 
notice; and to the loveliness of her mind 
and the excellencies of her heart he 
was alike insensible and indifferent. 
Even the natural feelings of a parent 



[ 96 J 

could keep alive in his bosom only a 
transient interest for n beautiful boy, of 
which ]\Irs. Herbert became the mother 
during the period of their retirement. 
He languished for the return of winter, 
which would again open to him the 
sources of all the enjoyments he was 
capable of tasting; when he again ex- 
pelled to see his wife take the lead in 
the throng of fashion, and to hear his 
own liappy fate the theme of every party. 

But here disappointment awaited him 
as severe as it was unexpeded. Lady 
Charlotte Brilliant, a new meteor, had 
appeared in the hemisphere of the beau 
monde, to eclipse the charms which had 
before demanded universal admiration ; 
and to snatch the wreath of beauty from 
the brow of Mrs. Herbert. 

Severely did his wounded vanity suffer 
by this mortifying change; nor, though 
he found it impossible to prevent his 
wife from sinking quietly and v/illingly 



[ 97 ] 

into the unobserved crowd of matrons, 
could he reconcile his own feelings to 
the shock of ranking with the dull 
assemblage of old married men ! 

To avert this dreaded evil, and still 
preserve his claim to notoriety, he 
plunged more deeply into fashionable 
excess. Mr. and jNIrs. Herbert were 
seen in every circle of gaiety, and their 
house was converted into the very tem- 
ple of dissipation; his dinners became 
more frequent, his parties more crowded, 
and their balls more splendid. 

It was with the sincerest regret that 
]Mrs. Herbert marked this ruinous pro- 
gress. She had, it is true, estimated, 
in a degree, the chara(5ler of her husband 
from the commencement of their ac- 
quaintance, and was fully aw^are of his 
incapacity to enjoy the gentle felicities 
of domestic life; but she had not be- 
lieved, she could not have imagined, 
that he was so lost to every virtuous 

VOL. T. F 



[ 93 ] 

sentiment, or capable of such gross 
libertinism, as she now perceived him to 
be devoted to. 

His total negle6l of herself she could 
have borne with uncomplaining resig- 
nation ; but she shuddered with horror 
when she reflected that her children 
(for she was now in expectation of a 
second confinement) might suffer both 
in their morals and future fortunes by 
his example and extravagance. Yet no 
hint, either bv word or look that could 
be construed into reproach, was ever 
allowed to escape her. 

With compassion, such as angels feel 
for erring mortals, she strove to win him 
to the love of virtue by example rather 
than reproof. From the moment she 
became a wife, she determiuedto fulfil, 
to the best of her ability, the several 
duties of the charader she then assumed; 
one of the principal of which she be- 
lieved to be an- endeavour to promote 



[ 99 3 

liei* husband's happiness. With this view 
she had sacrificed her own incUnation 
for retirement, to accommodate to his 
habits as far as regarded the mere frivo- 
lity of a fashionable Ufe; and even now 
that he was plunged into scenes of dis- 
sipation, in which she could have no 
share, she studiously adopted every 
means of rendering his home agreeable 
to him, whenever he devoted an hour 
to it. His absence for days and weeks 
never drew from her an expression of 
resentment; and his return was invari- 
ably welcomed Avith a smile. 

But the cold and selfish heart of Her- 
bert was not to be so softened. The 
amiable forbearance of the sufferinp; 
Caroline did not indeed escape his 
observation, but he observed it with 
displeasure. Her virtues were a tacit 
reproach on his own licentiousness, whicli 
both provoked and pained him. Had 
i>ht occasionally upbraided him, he would 
F 2 



[ 100 ] 

liave been better able to excuse to him- 
self the ill-humour with which he fre- 
quently behaved towards her, when losses 
at play, or other disappointments, had 
soured his temper and sent him home 
dissatisfied and unhappy. But he could 
not endure the perpetual sight of a mo- 
nitor, who, though silent, he well knew 
was not insensible, and between whose 
condu6l and his own he was aware the 
better judging world would institute a 
comparison neither to his honour or 
advantage. He now execrated the folly 
that had urged him to shackle himself, 
so early in life, with the galling yoke of 
matrimony, and take for a companion 
one whose sentiments and propensities 
were so opposite to his own. In each 
fair form that met his eye, he discovered 
charms to rival those which he had for- 
merly professed to find in Caroline's 
alone ; and to regain his liberty he 
would gladly have submitted to any 



[ 101 ] 

conclitions, even if they had been im- 
posed by a verdicl of Do6lor's Commons. 

Of this chance of freedom from his 
trammels, however, the unimpeachable^ 
reftitude of Mrs. Herbert's conda6l left 
him not the shadow of a hope. He- 
therefore resolved, as he could not alto- 
gether escape the wretched bondage, he 
would render it as little irksome as pos- 
sible; and for this purpose determined 
on his wife's passing the ensuing winter 
in the Forest, whilst he returned to the 
metropolis, unincumbered by one whom 
he now regarded as an impertinent spy 
upon his condu6l, and a troublesome 
restraint on his amusements. 

Accordingly at the close of the next 
summer, which he had passed at different 
watering-places, whilst the deserted Ca- 
roline had given birth to a little girl at the 
Lodge, Mr. Herbert wrote a laconic letter 
to her, in which, after stating her pre- 
ference for rural scenes and occupations 



[ 102 J 

t)ver the amusements of London, and 
slightly mentioning the present delicate 
state of her health, he proposed her 
continuing the remainder of the year 
in the New-Forest. 

It was with a confused mixture of 
inexpressible satisfaction and deep con- 
cern, that Mrs. Herbert received this 
proposal. The country was her deliglit, 
and a permanent residence in it most 
suitable to her habits and inclinations; 
but when she refle61ed on the pursuits 
in which her husband would be engaged, 
the connexions he had formed, and the 
dangers to which he would be exposed, 
if freed from all restraint; she could not 
without the most gloomy apprehensions 
anticipate the consequences of this extra- 
ordinary step. Her accustomed acqui- 
escence in her husband's desires dictated 
an immediate compliance with his pre- 
sent suggestion; but when in her answer 
to his letter she thanked him for his kind 



[ 103 ] 

consideration, and assured him of her 
readiness to adopt any plan which he 
might san6tion with his wish, she could 
not forbear to hint some afFe6lionate 
warning's with respecl to his own con- 
dud. They were conveyed in terms so 
gentle and yet so solemn, as must have 
affected a heart less impenetrable than 
Herbert's ; but vanity and vice had 
steeled it against any other emotions 
than joy at his emancipation from the 
domestic restraints of the conjugal tie. 
From this period he never expressed a 
wish that Caroline should spend any 
part of the year in London; he saw her 
but seldom, and whilst she passed her 
days in quiet seclusion at the Lodge, he 
continued year after year to whirl in 
the fatal vortex of town dissipation. 



[ 304 ] 



CHAPTER IV* 



^ I "^HE occupations which engaged 
-*- Mrs. Herbert, in her retirement, 
were every way calculated to tranquillize 
her mind, and heal her wounded spirit. 
Neglecled by the man to whom she was 
connected by the most solemn tie; sepa- 
rated from him whom her heart had 
chosen as its dearest friend ; deprived of 
a brother who had rendered every early 
trial tolerable by his sympathy and par- 
ticipation ; and in the bloom of life shut^ 
out, by the peculiarity of her circum- 



[ 105 ] 

stances, from the general intercourse of 
social life; she yet found a solace to her 
sorrows, and a source of soothing com- 
fort, in the conscientious discharge of 
the several duties which fell within her 
limited sphere ; and whilst pressing her 
babes to her beating bosom, and shed- 
ding over them the tear of maternal ten- 
derness, she experienced those sweet 
emotions, which can be known only to 
the mother Avho devotes herself to the 
interest and happiness of her children ; 
emotions which filled her heart with 
so calm, so full, so complete a pleasure, 
as scarcely left room for the belief that 
she had any real cause to think herself, 
unfortunate. 

With mingled gratitude and delight, 
she Avatched the gradual opening of their 
yet unformed minds, and anticipated the 
coming period, when 

" Infant reason grows apace, and calls - 

" For the kind hand of an assiduous care. ^ 



[ 106 ] 

" Delightful task ! to rear the tender thought, 
" To pour the fresh instruction o'er the mind, 
** To teach the young idea how to shoot, 
** To breathe the enlivening spirit, and to fix 
** The generous purpose in the glowing breast." 

Ill the exercise of her benevolence, 
also, she found an inexhaustible fund of 
satisfaction and employ. Poverty and 
wretchedness were unknown around her 
dwelling; every cottage in the neigh- 
bourhood bore testimony to her kind- 
ness and charity; whilst the blessings 
of their grateful inhabitants, many of 
whom from sickness and misery had 
been by her interference restored to 
health and comfort, afforded to her pure 
heart a richer feast than selfishness with 
all its gaudes and luxuries can ever taste. 
In the various plans for the welfare of 
her poorer neighbours, in which this 
systematic beneficence engaged her, she 
was ever assisted by the advice and 
exertions of Dr. Fairford, to whom the 
e6lory of Rosewood (the parish adjoin- 



[ 107 ] 

iiig to the Lodge) had been presented 
some little time before it became the 
settled residence of j\Irs. Herbert. Her 
pleasure, indeed, on first discovering 
that this venerable man was amongst the 
number of her nearest neighbours, had 
been in some measure checked by the 
apprehensions that their vicinity to each 
other might be produftive of occasional 
meetings between herself and one, whom 
it had been her constant endeavour, as 
it washer duty, to forget: but her anx- 
iety on this head was speedily relieved 
by the information that Frederick Fair- 
ford had eno-ao'ed in a mercantile con- 
nection in America, as soon as he 
understood that the future residence of 
his father was to be in the neighbouY- 
liood of that woman whom he felt he 
must ever fondly love. 

For her sake, as well as for the secu- 
rity af his own peace, lie condemned him- 
self to this banishment from his native 



I 108 ] 

land; a measure for which Mrs. Herbert's 
bosom thanked him in a sigh of mingled 
admiration, pleasure, and regret. She was 
not entirely ignorant of the motives of 
his sacrificing his friends and country ; 
and her gratitude for the conduct which 
those motives produced, could not but 
partake of a sorrowful recolledion that 
she was the unfortunate, though inno- 
cent cause of it. She could not, how- 
ever, avoid feeling a sincere gratification, 
that in consequence of this step of Frede- 
rick's she was now left at liberty to enjoy 
the society of his father, and to benefit 
by his conversation and example, without 
apprehension or restraint. 

Dr. Fairford, when he took possession 
of the rectory of Rosewood, was fast 
approaching his grand climaderic, his 
bodily powers but little impaired, and 
the faculties of his mind still in their 
youthful vigour. A life of regularity 
and temperance had secured the conti- 



[ 109 3 

nuance of the one, and a temper natu- 
rally cheerful, a benevolent heart, and 
a tranquillity of mind, the certain off- 
spring of genuine and habitual piety, 
had been the means of preserving him 
the other. The years of his infancy and 
early youth were passed amongst his 
native mountains in the north of Eng- 
land, under the eye and tuition of his 
exemplary father ; where the wild scenes 
of nature had stored his fancy with 
images of grandeur, which both created 
an early taste for the beautiful and sub- 
lime, and infused into his character an 
agreeable tindure of enthusiasm, that 
gave an additional ardour to his feelings, 
a peculiar elevation to his sentiments, 
and threw the most pleasing lustre over 
his whole character. 

With the principles of religion and 
virtue deeply impressed upon his mind, 
both by the example and precepts of his 
venerable parent, he was sent, at the 



[ no ] 

customary age to college, from whence, 
after taking his degrees with distin- 
guished credit, he happily returned to 
the romantic scenes of his childhood 
with the same simplicity of chara6ler 
and purity of heart as he possessed when 
he quitted them for the University. In 
a few years Mr. Fairford married the 
daughter of a neighbouring clergyman, 
a young lady every way worthy of her 
excellent consort; of similar manners, 
temper, and disposition; but whose soci- 
ety he enjoyed only for a short time, 
as she died during her first confinement, 
about ten days after she had presented 
her husband with that Frederick, whose 
name is already familiar to the reader. 
The afflidion was a heavy one ; but tho' 
bereft of his dearest earthly friend, Mr. 
Fairford had consolations, which, if they 
could not obliterate, at least alleviated 
the sense of his loss. The bright pros- 
pac"*! of a future inseparable union. 



[ 111 ] 

aiforded him by his religion, and die 
adive performance of those pious and 
philanthropic duties, which he knew 
could alone realize those pleasing antici- 
pations, preserved him from despond- 
ency, gradually healed his sorrows, and 
at length tranquillized his bosom. His 
attention was again completely occupied 
by the fun61ions of his profession ; and 
in the course of a ftw years, the educa- 
tion of his son presented a fresh obje6l 
of interesting employment to his mind. 
Having taken his dodor's degree, he 
confined himself entirely to his living, 
of which he became the father as well 
as pastor, and was at once esteemed, 
beloved, and venerated by all the parish- 
ioners. Indeed, the principles of Dr. 
Fairford were such as ensured him the 
respe6l of all those with whom goodness 
has the least chance of admiration. As 
a divine, holiness, charity, candour, and 
liberi>li^v were the prominent features 



[ 112 ] 

of his cliara6ler; and kindness and phi- 
lanthropy, which delighted in removing 
the pressure of misery, and increasing^ 
the innocent joys of those around him, 
stamped him with excellence as a man. 
His religion, free alike from priestly pride 
or sectarian asperity, taught him humi- 
lity and forbearance, diffidence in liis 
own speculations, and tenderness for 
those of others; and whilst it led him to 
form his conclusions respe^ling the value 
of opinions rather from anions than 
declarations, it induced him also to be- 
lieve that to be the purest system of. 
faith, which exemplified itself in a life 
of piety to God, and of brotherly love 
towards mankind. He was charitable to^ 
every thing but irreligion, and severe to 
nothing but profligacy; his heart glowed 
with a sympathetic benevolence for all 
his fellow-creatures, nor could any thing 
exclude them from his affe^lion, but an 
-"'^^vpd disrcfrard to religion and virtue. 



[ 113 ] 

Dr. Fairford indeed realized the de- 
scription of the poet, and embodied the 
charader that genius had sketched oil 
the canvass of fancy : 

" Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride, 

" And e'en his failings lean'd to virtue's side. 

'* But in his duty prompt at every call, 

" He watch'd and wept, he pray'd and felt for all j 

" And as a bird each fond endearment tries, 

** To tempt its new-fledg'd offspring to the skies,— 

" He tried each art, reproved each dull delay, 

" Allur'd to brighter worlds, and led the way.** 

With such an occasional companion 
to cheer her solitude, whose example 
would necessarily strengthen and fiK 
every better principle of her heart in 
the constant pradice of philanthropy, the 
daily exercise of the benevolent affec- 
tions, and the conscientious discharge 
of every parental duty, a mind like 
Mrs. Herbert's could not fail to expe- 
rience that tranquil enjoyment, "which 
ambition cannot taste, nor dissipation 
supply. Like the clear brook which 



[ 114 ] 

-winds its humble but fertilizing course 
through the shaded covert, unheeded 
by the passing traveller, but unruffled 
also by the storms and tempests which 
agitate the majestic river and expansive 
lake, the life of this exemplary charac- 
ter glided on in an uninterrupted stream 
of usefulness to others and satisfadion 
to herself. 

It was on her return one evening from 
a round of chaacable visits, when having 
extended her ride some miles beyond its 
custouiary limits, and being still in the 
midst of the New-Forest, at a consider- 
able distance from home, Mrs. Herbert 
perceived from the gathering clouds, the 
sullen roar of distant thunder, and the 
pattering of large drops of rain on the 
trees, that a furious storm was rapidly 
approaching. 

Turning into a glade that led towards 
the Lodge, she pressed her horse into a 
gallop, hoping to escape the worst of the 



E 115 ] 

tempest, but a vivid flash of lightning, 
.succeeded by loud and repeated claps of 
thunder, determined her to be guided 
by the advice of the groom who had 
before proposed that she should take 
shelter in one of the neighbouring cot- 
tages. They quickly approached a clay- 
built hovel, and a decent looking old 
woman who stood at the door, immedi- 
ately requested Mrs. Herbert to alight, 
and enter her humble dwelling, with 
such an air of kind hospitality as would 
not have disgraced a much more splendid 
habitation. *' Lack-a-day, madam," 
says sriC, while drawing a chair for her 
guest, '^ I wish I had a better place to 
ask you into; but mean as it is, 'twill 
shelter you from the storm, and you be 
truly welcome to stay till it is clear 
gone.'' jNIis. Herbert readily seated 
herself on a wooden bottomed chair, 
and being left alone in the homely apart- 
ment, while the old woman went to 



[ 116 3 

point out a place of shelter for the ser- 
vant and horses, she had sufficient leisure 
to examine its furniture ; a glance, in- 
deed, completed the survey ; and while 
the absence of common necessaries be- 
trayed the extreme of indigence, the 
cleanliness and neat appearance of every 
thing she sav/, proved a decency of mind,, 
that very much prepossessed Mrs. Her- 
bert in favour of the owner. 

A comparison, hastily sketched, be- 
tween the poverty of her present hospi- 
table hostess, and the affluence of her 
own circumstances, drew from the bosom 
of this amiable woman a sigh, in which 
gratitude and piety had an equal share. 
A spontaneous wish to add another a6l 
of benevolence to those in which she 
was daily occupied arose in her mind; 
and she was already busied in plans for 
the accomplishment of her charitable 
purpose, when the cry of a child inter- 
rupted her meditations, and awakened 



[ 117 ] 

a new train of ideas. The sound pro- 
ceeded from an inner room, the door of 
which stood half open. 

Mrs. Herbert, with all a mother's ten- 
der sensibility, sprang to the apartment, 
where she discovered two beds of straw 
on the floor, covered with linen, white 
as the blossom of the hawthorn; on one 
of these lay a lovely child, who already 
awakened by the rolling of the thunder, 
screamed aloud at the sightof a stranger, 
and throwing its arms about the neck of 
a pretty little girl, who hung in fond 
solicitude over the bed, hid its face iu 
her bosom. 

At this moment the old woman re- 
turned, and apologising for such a dis- 
turbance, took the child from its young 
nurse, and having hushed its fears, and 
told the girl to follow them into the outer 
room, she entreated that her guest would 
be pleased to resume her seat. '' Alack, 
poor Mary," she cried, while wiping 



[ 118 ] 

away the tears, "vrhich now silently 
coursed each other clown her rosy cheeks, 
'^ thee'st little think how many worse 
storms than this, thou'lt meet with in 
life. Is it not a sweet infant, madam ?" 
' One of the most lovely, I ever beheld,' 
returned Mrs. Herbert. ' Is she related 
to your' '^ Alack-a-day, madam, no; 
she is no relation of ours, " replied the 
poor woman. *^ If the truth were known 
indeed I fancy she's a chance-child; 
but it was a sorry chance for her, poor 
girl, when she lit on such poor folks as 
we be : not that I grudge her any thing 
I can g'e her, but for her own sake, 1 
am sorry she is not likely to be better 
off; for I am now old, and Jenny there, 
whenever it shall please God to take me, 
will be almost as good as friendless. 
What then will become of poor Mary, I 
knoArnot." Mrs. Herbert's eyes during 
this speech had been fixed on the child, 
who, now perfectly awake and recovered 



[ 119 ] 

from her late alarm, smiled in her face, 
while she pressed its dimpled hand within 
lier own, and in that smile discovered a 
resemblance, which, however accidental 
and transient, awakened in her bosom 
ideas and remembrances, that instantly 
secured there the most partial interest 
in favour of the orphan. *' M\ good 
woman," said she, *' after a moment's 
pause, you have greatly raised my curi- 
osity; you appear to be now in a station 
that you have not always been accus- 
tomed to; if it be no secret, tell me your 
story, and inform me how this pretty 
creature came under your protedion ? 
I do not ask from an idle curiosity, but 
M'ith a wish to relieve your necessities." 
' Heaven bless you, my good lady, ' re- 
plied the old woman, ' you are very kind 
to trouble yourself about such poor folk 
as we; poor enough we be in all con- 
science, but, thank God, we be honest; 
and a good name, you know, madam. 



[ 120 ] 

as I often tell my Jenny, the wise man 
says, '' is better than great riches." ' 
^' Right," interrupted Mrs. Herbert, 
^' and I heartily wish that a greater 
number of every class of people thought 
with Solomon in that respe6l; but I am 
most impatient for your story." 

' Lack-a-day, madam, ' she answered, 
' my story may be told in a very f^w 
words; there is little in it to entertain 
yCj I fear. I was born of creditable pa- 
rents, w^ho wxre very well to do in the 
world, and who might ha' gid me a few 
hundred pounds; but I married early in 
life against their consent, thinking I 
knew better than they what w as best for 
me, and I ha' often thought the mis- 
fortunes that folloAved w^ere a kind of 
judgment for my undutifulness; they 
never forgave me, and died without 
g'eing me their blessing, or leaving any 
provision for me or my children. John 
Wheatley, (for that w^as the name of my 



[ 121 ] 

husband) was to be sure only a labour- 
ins; man in the gardens or o'rounds, 
whereever he could get employed. But 
a' Avas sober, honest, and industrious, 
and though a' had been wild in his 
youth, which was the reason, I suppose, 
of my friends' objedion, a' turned very 
steady after he married, and behaved 
kindly and tenderly to me. Whilst he 
worked out of doors, / took in sewing, 
and by good management we always 
contrived to have a little laid up against 
a rainy day, as the saying is: well, in a 
few years we were able to keep a cow, a 
pig, and a few poultry, which helped 
greatly. It pleased God that we had 
only two children, a son and a daughter; 
whom, to the best of our knowledge, we 
endeavoured to bring up in the fear of 
the Lord, and dutv to their neio-hbours. 
For several years we were as happy as 
the day was long. Oh, madam, it is 
but very lately that I have been able to 

VOL. I. G 



[ 122 ] 

look back upon that time without crying 
bitterly, but I a' no tears left now, I 
believe: — Well, no matter; but as I was 
saying, all v/ent smoothly on till my 
daughter was about eighteen years of 
age. At that time, a great squire in our 
neio'hbourhood set about building' a 
fine house. It was to be so grand, that 
the country workmen were not good 
enough to be employed ; so a' sent for a 
great many topping hands from London. 
Amongst the carpenters came a young 
man, who said a' was well known to an 
old friend of my husband's, and indeed 
he brought a letter of recommendation 
to 'en from Mr. Jenkinson, and for his 
sake at first we received him kindly, 
but afterwards, when we saw more of 'en, 
we liked 'en for his own. He used to 
spend all his evenings at our house, go 
to church wi' us constantly every Sunday, 
and seemed so sober, and was withal so 
cheerful and pleasant, that in a little 



[ ]r3 ] 

time we loved 'en as if a' had been one of 
the family. Many a time have my poor 
husband and I said, happy would be the 
woman that Jacob should fix on for a 
wife; and to be sure I can't say how 
happy we were, when we found, of all 
the village girls, our own Betty was his 
favourite. Well did she deserve his 
love, indeed, for never was there a better 
or more dutiful child. To cut short my 
story, however, a' soon won her heart, 
and her father gi'd his consent to the 
match. About a week before the wedding 
day, the squire's house being finished, 
Jacob took leave of us for a few days, 
to go to Lunnon, as a' said, on business. 
We were all very sorry to part wi' him; 
but Betty, methought, seemed more 
afflicted than was reasonable, considerino- 
how very soon they were to meet again : 
Poor thing 1 her sorrow was a warning 
of what was to follow. " The old woman 
here paused, and observing Jenny's tears 
G 2 



f 124 ] 

flowed fast, she bade her g*o and put the 
child to bed again ; an errand the weep- 
ing girl gladly availed herself of, and 
Dame Wheatley then renewed her nar- 
rative. ' ' Betty received one letter from 
him a few days after a' left the country, 
but though we expelled 'en every day, 
yet several weeks passed on without his 
appearance, or so much as a second letter 
to Betty. My husband and I now began 
to be very much frightened ; John our 
son said, for sartain Jacob was dead ; 
nothing else could occasion this silence. 
Poor Betty said nothing; but she looked 
as if her heart would burst, and moped 
about, the very picture of despair, when 
she thought we did not see her; yet 
when wi' us, she always forced a smile ; 
it was however a melancholy one, and 
only served to shew us plainer how much 
she suffered. At last, her father, quite 
tired of waiting, without saying any 
thing to our poor child, wrote to the 



[ 125 ] 

person who had recommended Jacob to 
us, desiring to know what had become 
of him : as bad hack would lia' it, the 
answer came when we were all sitting 
together, my husband broke the seal, 
and when he had read the letter, * I 
feared as much!' he cried; 'Oh, that 
bad man, Jacob! But don't grieve for 
him, my dear love, he does not deserve 
it; base fellow! he is married to ano- 
ther woman.' ** Then, indeed, I am 
undone!" cried the poor girl, as she fell 
without life on the floor. Oh, good 
madam ! how shall I tell you what her 
poor father and myself felt at this speech. 
But why," continued she, observing 
Mrs. Herbert deeply affected, ** why 
should I pain your heart, by relating 
all the particulars of our affliction? 
From this moment, the poor soul 
never held up her head, and lived no 
longer than till she brought into the 
world Jenny, the girl that is just gone. 



[ ne ] 

in t'other room. Poor child 1 she is ten- 
der-hearted, and always cries when she 
hears her mother's sad story, but it is a 
lesson that I hope she will be the better 
for. Once her mother was as innocent 
as herself. Well, madam, the death of 
my poor dear Betty was a heavy stroke 
to us all : my dear husband never reco- 
vered it, and after some months' hard 
struggle between grief and sickness, he 
too was taken from me, 

*' John, my son, had been some time 
married to a very good young woman, 
and rented a pretty little farm at the 
edo-e of the Forest. On his father's 
death, he proposed to take me into part- 
nership; and as it was lonely for me and 
little Jenny to live by ourselves, he took 
us home to his own house, where he and 
his wife did every thing to make us 
comfortable. For a little while we v»'ent 
on very well; till a wicked neighbour, 
tosave himself from punishment, accused 



[ 127 1 

my son of stealing the King's deer. That 
they every year had done 'en a terrible 
deal of mischief, was very well known, 
and a deer was one night found dead in 
an outhouse of his; but God knows, John 
was innocent. All he could say, how- 
ever, went for nothing; the justice who 
examined 'en, was a hard man, and 
besides, might be a little overtaken with 
VinJ at tlie time, for lie often did bu- 
siness after dinner ; and in spight of all 
that could be said in John's favour, he 
sent 'en to prison. To Winchester the 
poor fellow went, with a heart almost 
broke; leaving his family, as you may be 
sure, m,adam, as much affli6led as him- 
self. I had been poorly in health, in- 
deed, a good while, and this disgrace 
and distress of my son made me so much 
worse, that I was unable to assist my 
daughter in the management of the 
farm during the many months that 
passed between John's commitment and 



[ 128 ] 

the 'size-time. By degrees every thing 
went to rack and ruin, and we were 
obliged to sell some part of our little 
stock to pay our rent, the expences of 
TLYf illness, and to support John in jail. 
Two or three weeks however before the 
assizes, the wicked fellow who had 
adually committed the offence for which 
f ohn had been imprisoned, being disco- 
vered in deer-stealing, Avas sent to \ ^% 
Chester, when a' confessed that he nad 
killed the buck which was found in my 
son's outhouse. John was of course 
acquitted on the charge, but he returned 
home only to follow to the grave his 
dear wife Sally, whose heart Avas broke 
by her husband's going to jail, and his 
goods being seized by his landlord under 
a warrant of distress for rent. Poor lad 1 
hov/ much did he take on. I verily 
thought he too would ha' died for grief; 
but it pleased God to strengthen him to 
support his trial, and to be a comfort to 



[ 129 ] 

his mother. Indeed, he never forgot 
me in his afflidion, but declared I should 
share every penny he earned ; and with 
his own hand built me the cottage in 
which I now live. Having no children, 
however, he thought it would be better 
for 'en to go into service, and a' was 
lucky enough at once to get into 
constant work at the Lodge, (Squire 
Herbert's.)" Percei\ing her auditor 
change colour, the old woman hesitated* 
'' Sure, madam,'' said she, " I tire you 
with my long story." * Not at all, not 
at all,' replied Mrs. Herbert ; ' pray go 
on, tell me how you live now, and how 
you came by the interesting child, which 
I have just seen.' '^ As for the matter 
of living, madam," continued the old 
woman, '^ what wi' knitting and spin- 
ning, we do pretty well. Then \ye keep 
a little school at day-time; for Jenny can 
read, write, and sew, ver\' tolerably^ 
though she is only eight year.s old, and 



[ 130 



1 



never had any other larning than what 
I could gi' her: so she teaches the letters 
and needle-work, while I, because my 
eyes be nov/ too bad for any thing else, 
shew the children hov/ to knit and spin; 
and concerning that sweet baby, it is, I 
believe, about two years, come Candle- 
mas, since Jenny and I coming home 
late one night from the next market*- 
town, saw a man just before us, who 
w^as walking very slowly, talking very 
much to himself. There was something 
so particular about 'en, that, being a 
little frightened, I thought I'd watch to 
see wdiich road he went, and get out of 
his way; for I could not help thinking 
lie was beside himself. Sometimes he 
stopped, and fell down on his knees; 
then he got up again, and took some- 
thing out of a basket he carried; then 
he laid it down in the road, went away 
a few steps, and walked slowly back again; 
at last, a' took it up, and said with a 



[ isi I 

shocking oath, *^ I cannot do it; if I am 
murdered myself, I cannot do it." The 
word murder sadly frightened me; how- 
ever I said nothing to Jenny, but pre- 
tending to be tired, sat down, till I 
thought he had got a good way down 
the road, and then hurrying the child 
along, I took the first path that I knew 
led to our cottage. But, lack-a-day I 
madam, we had not gone a hundred 
yards, when what should I see but the 
very same man sitting on the stump of 
a tree almost close to us ; he looked at 
me, and getting up very quickly, and 
placing his basket just in the path before 
us, '* For God's sake, good woman," said 
he, ''have compassion on a poor innocent 
baby ; I have too many crimes to answer 
for already." So saying, a' ran forward 
and was out of sight before I had time 
to make any answer: so much indeed 
was I frighted, that I hardly knew whe- 
ther I was awake or in a dream, espe- 



[ 132 ] 

cially as there was something in his 
voice that made me think I had heard 
it before. Before I had recovered myself, 
Jenny opened the basket, and screamed 
out, ' Oh, granny ! here is a httle baby, 
but I believe it is dead.' God forbid, 
my chikl, says I, as I looked into the 
basket, where indeed I saw an infant 
seemingly about a month old, not dead 
however, as Jenny supposed, but in a 
sound sleep. * Oh, granny ! let us take 
the little thing home,' said she, ' 1 will 
nurse and play with it; you Vv^ill not 
leave it here, granny ?' I was so sur- 
prized, madam, that I could not answer 
the child immediately. However, I 
had no doubts, as she feared, about 
taking care of the poor babe. So wrap- 
ping it in my cloak, I gi'd Jenny the 
basket to carry, and after waiting a 
little while to see if the man would re- 
turn, hurried to our cottage as fast as 
I could. Of the man we saw no more, 



[ 133 ] 

but the story soon spread, and numbers 
of people came out of curiosity to see 
tlie little child that had been found in 
the Forest ; but no one wished to have 
any hands in taking care of it. Some 
advised me at once to carry it to the 
workhouse: others said, the child had 
most likely been stolen, and they should 
be afeard of coming to trouble about it: 
but one, wiser than the rest, persuaded 
me to advertise it : this I listened to, 
not because I Avanted to get quit of the 
poor thing, but because I thought I 
might, by so doing, find out its parents^ 
who perhaps were then grieving for their 
loss ; but the advertisement was never 
answered, nor from that day to this, 
have I been able to guess who it could 
belong to. The parish-officers were in- 
deed very good, and offered to ha' the 
child taken care of, know^ing, as they 
said, my poverty; but they insisted on 
taking it into the house, and indeed, 



[ 134 ] 

madam, I could not bring myself to part 
with it, for it seemed to me that Heaven 
had thrown it in my way for some end 
which I could not then foresee, and I 
believed it my duty to take all the care 
I could of it. I knew that for some 
years it could take but little from oup 
means, and I thought to myself, it was 
but working a little harder when it 
wanted more, and that in time it might 
be able to maintain itself: so, madam, 
I got a poor neighbour, who luckily then 
had been just brought to bed, to nurse 
it for a few weeks; when it was strong- 
enough to be weaned, I then, with 
Jenny's help, took charge of it, and it 
throve and grew apace, and never was 
there a lovelier babe, as you might have 
seen ; for our parts, we love it as well 
as if it was ever so nearly related to us." 
Mrs. Herbert, whose heart was ' ^ open 
as day to melting charity," had been 
extremely aifefted by the whok of this 



[ 155 J 

simple unadorned narrative of fa6ls ; 
but for the little foundling she felt an 
unusual degree of interest; and after a 
few moments' consideration, proposed to 
the old woman to take the entire charge 
of it upon herself. Dame Wheatley's 
looks expressed a mixture of surprize and 
doubt; which ^Irs. Herbert perceiving, 
immediately informed her of her name 
and residence. The old woman no 
longer felt any degree of repugnance to 
resign the little girl to a lady, whose 
chara6ler for beneficence and goodness 
she had frequently heard celebrated by 
her son in language of the warmest 
praise and admiration. With many 
blessings therefore on her humanity, she 
immediately acceded to Mrs. Herbert's 
proposal; but the evening was now far 
advanced, the storm dispersed, and the 
horses at the door; there was not, con- 
sequently, at present, time for farther 
arrangements, and Mrs. Herbert, bidding 



[ ^36 ] 

lier hostess adieu with much kindness, 
promised to see her again very speedily, 
when slipping a crown into the hand of 
Jenny as she again kissed the sleeping 
babe, she mounted her horse, and pur- 
sued her way home. 

The sky was now clear; the moon had 
risen in full splendour, and with her 
silver ray tipped the dark woods which 
fringed the horizon on all sides, M'hile 
the soft light Mas refleded from the 
spreading foliage of the majestic oak on 
which the drops of rain still trembled. 
The yellow blossom of the lowly furze, 
and \et more hum We purple flower of 
the heath, blending their sweets with the 
frao'vance of a thousand other aromatic 
plants and herbs, sown by the liberal 
hand of nature, poured upon the sur- 
rounding air a cloud of rich perfume. 
The feathered tribes had already chaunt- 
ed their evening song, and were now 
still in their sheltered nests; all but the 



[ 137 ] 

niohtino-ale, whose tlirillino; notes swelled 
on the breeze with sweet and soothing 
melody. Again the timid tenants of the 
forest, the graceful deer, so lately driven 
by the tempest to their secret recesses, 
ventured forth, and with frequent starts, 
fearfullv o'lancino- round, as if to assure 
themselves of safety from the murderous 
intruder, man, frisked in playful gambols 
on the velvet turf, or bounded lightly 
through the glade to commit their 
nightly depredations on the ripening 
harvest of the neighbouring farm. Then 
is the time, 

" For those whom wisdom and whom nature charm, 
** To steal themselves from the degenerate world, 
** And soar above the little scene of things, 
" To soothe the throbbing passions into peace, 
" And woo lone quiet in her silent walks." 



[ 138 ] 



CHAPTER V 



MRS. Herbert, to whom the charms 
of nature afforded a source of 
never- failing delight, rode home in silent 
rapture, meditating on the adventures 
of the evening, and forming schemes 
for the future welfare of the little orphan, 
and the m.ore comfortable accommoda- 
tion of its indigent protectress. Her 
husband's absence from the Lodge pre- 
vented her from consulting him on the 
subje6l; nor did she perceive any rea- 
sonable ground of apprehension that he 
could objecl to them. 



[ 139 ] 

The allowance made by her marriage 
settlement had been ample ; and a rational 
oeconomy, which no superfluous expences 
ever broke in upon, enabled her to in- 
dulge every benevolent purpose, without 
appropriating in that manner any part 
of the sum annually allotted by Mr. 
Herbert for the establishment at the 
Lodge. 

The opportunity which now presented 
itself of prote6ling helpless infancy, and 
relieving the indigence of advanced life, 
was to Mrs. Herbert irresistible ; and 
having communicated the particulars of 
her visit to Dame Wheatley's cottage to 
Dr. Fail ford, and received his san6lion 
on her plan, on the following morning 
she sent for the little girl. As soon as 
a more comfortable dwelling could be 
prepared for her reception, the old 
Avoman was removed from the hovel she 
had so long inhabited, and established 
as superintendant of the Dairy; whilst, 



[ HO ] 

as a reward for his dutiful conduct to his 
mother, and some compensation for his 
early misfortune, Mrs. Herbert raised 
her son John from a day-labourer in the 
field to the place of game-keeper, which 
happened to be at that time vacant. She 
wished also to have taken little Jenny 
into her o\vn family, but the old woman 
acknowledged she should feel quite de- 
solate if deprived of both the children 
at once. Jenny, therefore, was per- 
mitted to remain with her grand-mother, 
except at those hours when she attended 
a school, established by the Dodor, and 
patronised by Mrs. Herbert, where the 
children of the neighbouring poor made 
daily progress in the knowledge of their 
moral and religious duties, at the same 
time that they were instruded in the 
means of getting their bread. 

The benevolence which had prompted 
Mrs. Herbert's condu6l in this affair, 
goon found a sweet and ^'ratify in sr reward 



t 1-il ] 

in the uncommonly amiable qualities of 
the orphan, and the grateful attachment 
of its former humble protestors. In a 
short time, indeed, little i\Iary became 
a general favourite in the family. Ed- 
mund and Matilda M^ere delio-hted with 
the acquisition of a new play-fellow, an 
aifeclion which their mother encourao-ed 
with alacrity, as she perceived that it 
was returned by the warm heart of the 
little interesting stranger with a pro- 
portionate ardour. Edmund especially 
became every day more assiduous in 
promoting the pleasure of his adopted 
sister. For her sake, the young hero, 
like the knights of old, would brave the 
most formidable dangers. For her he 
would climb the forest oak, to despoil it 
of its acorns, or the mountain ash of 
its beautiful berries. He would now 
tempt the deceitful marsh to gather the 
penciled Iris; and now with numbed 
fingers pluck the long transparent icicle 



[ 142 ] 

that hung ghttering from the low straw- 
thatched cottage. Matilda also was 
never unwilling to share with her friend 
any of the little treasures she possessed 
from the liheral, but well-regulated in- 
dulgence of her excellent mother; who, 
on her part, found her own satisfadion 
increase, as she observed in her daugh- 
ter the germ of those excellent qualities 
of the mind and heart, which it was 
the chief and sweetest employment of 
life to nourish, expand, and perfe6l. 

Thus year after year glided on with 
little variation in the habits of Mrs. 
Herbert's family, until Mary attained, 
as nearly as Dame Wheatley could ascer- 
tain, her sixth year, when its tranquil- 
lity was suddenly interrupted by an 
unexpe6led visit from Mr. Herbert, 
accompan ied by Sir Charles Fitzmordaun t 
and his wife, a handsome but highly 
fashionable French-woman. 



[ 1*3 ] 

When introduced to ]\Irs. Herbert by 
her husband as Lady Antoinette Fitz- 
mordaunt, the blooming bride, with 
affected rapture, flew forwards to embrace 
her sister-in-law, and in imperfe6l Eng- 
lish expressed the extreme happiness she 
experienced at an interview for which 
she had languished with unspeakable 
impatience. *' Ah, ma chere soeur," 
cried she, ''what joy shall I find in your 
charming society ! How gladl}^ shall I 
receive you for my instrudress in the 
fashions and pleasures of your enchant- 
ing country ! Oh, what an air, what 
loveliness ! Teach me those winnins: 
graces, those bewitching manners !" — 
' Your own manners, my dear Lady 
Antoinette, are already so fascinating,' 
interrupted !Mr. Herbert, ' and the fash- 
ions you have imported so becoming, 
that it is impossible either should be 
improved by such a rustic as Caroline.' 
** Ah! que vous etes un flateur," replied 



[ '44 ] 

the lady, surveying lierself with an air 
of increased complacency in a large pier- 
glass, and adjusting at the same time 
some of the gaudy ornaments with which 
she was decorated. 

]\Irs. Herbert, though disgusted with 
the levity and conceit of her sister, made 
a polite return to her compliments, and 
assured her, she felt herself much ho- 
noured by her expressions of regard. 
At this moment Sir Charles entered the 
room, and his sister, glad of an oppor- 
tunity of breaking from Lady Antoinette, 
immediately stepped forward to welcome 
him to the Lodge. But the words she 
would have pronounced hung upon her 
faltering tongue, as she involuntarily 
started back at the deepened gloom 
which she observed to be settled on his 
features. His brow contraded itself as 
if with anxious thought. His counte- 
nance was wan, and his eye hollow, 



[ 1+-5 ] 

with an expression at once melancholy 
and fierce. 

A few seconds elapsed before she could 
sufficiently recover from her disorder ta 
congratulate him on his marriage; and 
to chide him pleasantly for having so 
long delayed to inform her of it. He 
advanced, and offered her his hand, 
endeavouring to force his features into 
a smile; but it was evidently doing vio- 
lence to them, and his confused answer 
to what his sister had said, proved 
clearly that his countenance was too 
true an index to the gloom and agita- 
tion of his bosom. 

Mrs. Herbert was affe6led by his ap- 
pearance, and strove, by leading the 
conversation to general subjects, to 
divert his thoughts from that secret' 
melancholy which seemed so much to 
depress them. His manner, howev¥r,' 
was embarrassed and absent; and his 
attention seemed to be direded to any*- 

VOL. I. li 



[ 146 ] 

thing rather than to what was said by his 
sister. The entrance of the children at 
length proved a reUef to Mrs. Herbert, 
at whose desire Edmund and Matilda 
ran to their father, and threw their arms 
around his neck with an apparent 
warmth of affe61ion that for a moment 
awakened the parent in his bosom. 
Mary, in the mean time, walked silently 
to Mrs. Herbert's chair, where she stood 
a few moments unnoticed, whilst her 
companions were introduced to their 
uncle and aunt. The appearance of the 
children seemed to add to the agitation 
of Sir Charles, and when he spoke to 
Edmund his emotion would hardly allow 
him to articulate; at length turning 
suddenly round towards Mary, '* and to 
■whom does that little girl belong?" said 
he, ''you have but two children, I think, 
Caroline ?" 

* This is a little orphan,' replied Mrs. 
Herbert, * a child which I found in 



[ 147 ] 

a friendless state, and which Mr. Her- 
bert kindly allows me to take under 
my prote^lion/ ** An orphan!'' said 
Sir Charles, hastily raising the au- 
burn ringlets that overshadowed her 
forehead, and gazing earnestly on her 
face; *' an orphan 1 Do you not kr . v 
her parents ?" Mary coloured and shrunk 
back; but Sir Chailes, grasping her 
hand, reiterated his question, whilst the 
frightened child clung closer to her 
protectress. 

By this time the vehemence of the 
baronet had excited the attention of all 
the party, and Lady Antoinette en- 
quired, ^^ what was the matter?'* 

*^ Didi/ozi observe it?" cried he impe- 
tuously. ' Observe what ?' returned her 
ladyship. ^*An orphan, did you say?" 
repeated he wdth the most violent emo- 
tion, not at all attending to his lady's 
question. But before Mrs. Herbert could 
make any reply, her husband, bursting 
H 25 



t i-ts ] 

into a loud laugh, exclaimed, ' Ton my 
honour, Fitzmordaunt, I helieve you 
mean to claim ]\Iary for your own pro- 
perty. Well, you have my most decided 
consent; and I should think Caroline 
also would by this time have no ob- 
je6lion to be rid of the burthen. You, 
Lady Antoinette, will certainly not refuse 
to receive a protegee of your husbands.' 
This speech excited much merriment 
between Mr. Herbert and the lady to 
whom the latter part of it was addressed; 
which gave Sir Charles an opportunity 
of recoverino- from the disorder into 

o 

which he had been surprized, and of 
learning from ^Irs. Herbert an outline 
of Mary's story. '' And pray, Caroline," 
said he v/ith assumed composure, ^^ what 
do you mean to do with this adopted 
child?" ■ I mean,' she replied, ^ to 
educate her in a manner that may enable 
her to become a virtuous and useful 
member of society; for indeed her 



amiable disposition has so far won iinoii 
iny heart, that I lo\e her ahiiost with a 
mother's fondness. ' * ^And I too, '' cried 
Edmund, running up to I\Iary, and 
kissing her cheek, '' love her dearly." 
Sir Cliarles bit his lip in silence, and 
Mrs. Herbert seeing that the chikl still 
continued to be alarmed by the violence 
and peculiarity of his manner, kindly 
bade her retire with her companions to 
resume tlieir play. 

Ladv Antoinette, elevating: her shoul- 
ders with a shrug, to which no precise 
meaning was annexed, and smiling for 
the sole purpose of displaying her ivory 
teeth, observed it was une avanture biea 
drole; and continued her conversation 
with ]\Ir. Herbert on the same trifling 
topics which had before engaged her 
attention. 

Not so ]\Irs. Herbert. She had been 
somewhat alarmed, as well as exceedingly 
suvpvizedj at the violent confusion Avhich 



[ 150 j 

Sir Cliarles had manifested on seeinir 
Alary. She Avas clear this effed could 
not be accidental; and her imagination 
immediately suggested, that there might 
be some connection (though of what 
nature she could not conceive) between 
the little girl and the melancholy which 
seemed to shade her brothers mind. 
Her speculations, however, were only 
momentary ; for Sir Charles, after a short 
silence, began, with some degree of anx- 
iety in his manner, to reprove her for 
thus receiving into her family a child 
of whom nobody could give any account, 
which might be a beggar's brat, or the 
illegitimate offspring of the lowest pea- 
sant. *' Besides," continued he, '' do 
you not foresee the anxiety which you 
are laying up for yourself hereafter, in 
indulo'ino' this romantic w^iim? l^o vou 
not perceive that the little urchin will 
be a source of unhappiness to the family? 
Edmund is already doatingly fond of the 



[ 151 ] 

ciiild; and depend upon it, his affedioii 
^vill not be lessened by the constant 
familiar intercourse that must subsist 
between them, if you continue her under 
your protedion. Conceive the disgrace 
that would attach to the whole family, 
if my nephew should hereafter think se- 
riously of a base-born foundling." 

* I have always been of opinion,' re- 
plied Mrs. Herbert, * that no opportunity 
of promoting certain good should be 
negle6led, from the indistinct apprehen- 
sion of incurring future evil. On this 
principle I have taken charge of Mary. 
With my husband's approbation, I res- 
cued the dear child from poverty, pos- 
sibly from guilt and wretchedness. The 
good old woman who was the humble 
instrument of heaven to save her, per- 
haps from the knife of the murderer^ 
was my example. She did all in her 
power; but sorely oppressed with want 
and affliction herself, she could only 



[ 15i2 ] 

have transmitted to Mary the inheritance 
of her own misery. Could I then have 
acled otherwise than I have r Surely, 
brother, had you been thus circum- 
stanced, you AV'ould not, you could not, 
have avoided doino- as 1 have done." 

Sir Charles, colouring deeply, rose from 
liis chair, and having measured the room 
with hasty strides, again sat down ; whilst 
Mrs. Herbert continued: " For the res t, 
it shall be my earnest endeavour to give 
Mary just notions of the various duties 
she has to perform, as a religious, a ra- 
tional, and a social being. If she 
answer the expectations which I confess 
I am sanguine enough already to ha^'e 
formed, I shall have no reason to regret 
the pains I may take on her account. 
If not, the consequences must rest with 
herself; whilst my disappointment will 
be lightened by the consciousne^ of 
having discharged my duty," 



[ 153 ] 

'But,' resumed Sir Charles hastily, 
* do you really wish me to understand 
that you are indifferent as to the probable 
efFecis which the constant intercourse 
between Edmund and ]\Iary may pro- 
duce? Are you careless about the fond- 
ness which he already discovers for her? 
And would you consent to so preposte- 
rous a thing- as an union between them^ 
supposing he Averc to grow up with the 
same sentiments of preference which the 
boy at present entertains for this adopted 
orphan r' 

'' I candidly acknowledge," returned 
IVIrs. Herbert with a smile, '' the formi- 
dable dano-er you mention never till 
this moment presented itself to my ima- 
gination ; nor does it even now appear 
to be of sufficient magnitude to excite 
just cause of uneasiness. At any rate, 
several years n"kust elapse before what 
you dread could possibly take place; and 
in the mean time I promise you my 



[ ^^^ 1 

utmost care will be exerted to prevent 
any thing that might refle6l disgrace 
upon our family. I shall endeavour to 
implant in the minds of all my dear 
children a proper self -esteem^ a just 
sense of honour and integrity, and that 
rational and ingenuous pride, which will 
make them despise all that is vicious and 
base ; and with principles like these in 
their minds, we shall, I hope, have little 
reason to apprehend that they will dis- 
grace either their families or themselves." 
Though this speech was not entirely 
suited to the taste of the baronet, yet 
as it would bear an interpretation which 
met in some degree the sentiments he 
had expressed, he did not feel altogether 
dissatisfied with it; taking therefore 
Mrs. Herbert's hand, he begged, in a 
more gentle tone, that she would pardon 
*^ the warmth with which he had ex- 
pressed the interest he must ever feel in 
what related to herself and her children; 



[ 155 ] 

assured her he thought her little pro- 
tegee promised fair to reward her kind- 
ness; but at the same time begged she 
>vould be prepared for a disappointment, 
as he was forced to acknowledge that 
ingratitude in similar instances was by 
no means uncommon." 

Here terminated a conversation which 
was never again resumed. Sir Charles 
affedled indeed to treat Mary with some 
little degree of kindness, but ^Irs. Her- 
bert easily deteded the coldness of dis- 
like under this forced behaviour; and 
the child, who had not forgotten the 
surprize and terror excited by his first 
salutation, received with shyness and 
reserve all his marks of attention. No 
consideration could induce her to coun- 
terfeit a regard which she did not feel; 
and as her example already influenced the 
condu.ct of Edmund, who adopted both 
her attachments and dislikes; iMatilda 
appeared to be the only one of the little 



[ 1^^ ] 

group on A\liom Sir Charles's faint 
caresses were not entirely thrown away. 
As a more intimate acquaintance fur- 
ther developed the character of Lady 
Antoinette to !Mrs. Herbert^ no favour- 
able trait appeared, which in any degree 
lessened the disagreeable impression 
made by her first introduction. She 
discovered her new sister to be vain and 
artificial; bold in lier behaviour, and 
free in her opinions ; the symmetry of 
her form spoiled by the constant dis- 
tortions of afFe6lation, and the delicacy 
of her complexion concealed rather than 
heightened by a mask of paint. Her 
studied graces destroyed the natural 
expression of her beautiful features, 
whilst her confident air of tonish supe- 
riority entirely obliterated every enga- 
ging female charm. Her mind, in tlie 
mean time, was wholly uncultivated; 
her conversation frivolous, and her sen- 
timents mean; yet a fashionable educa- 



tioii had given her many artificial ac- 
quirements; and as she had an easy 
address, talked with vohibihty on all 
subjecis, whether she understood them 
or not; danced well, sang in a superior 
stile, and swept tlie strings of the harp 
with grace and execution; Lady Antoi- 
nette passed in society for an enchanting- 
woman. She possessed also a certain 
playfulness of manner, which won atten- 
tion from the other sex, and often ex- 
cited the angry jealousy of her own. 
In Mrs. Herbert's, eye, however, it wore 
the appearance of disgusting levity, tha' 
she endeavoured to persuade herself that 
it might result from national habits, 
rather than from want of prhiciple or 
depravity of heart. 

From Sir Charles's conduct it was evi- 
dent that whatever might have been his 
attachment to his wife originaUy, it had 
now faded away into indifference if 
not dislike. The striking contrast in 



[ 153 ] 

their dispositions, indeed, led Mrs. Her- 
bert to suspecl, that genuine aifedion 
had not formed the basis of their union; 
and when she discovered that Lady An- 
toinette was the only child of a French 
noble of some wealth, and greater ex- 
pedations, she was convinced, that 
her brother had been actuated by 
mercenary motives rather than by the 
dictates of his heart. But she had no 
means of obtaining information on this 
head. Sir Charles studiously avoided 
every chance of being alone with his 
sister. A settled gloom appeared to have 
taken possession of his mind ; a myste- 
rious subject of sorrow seemed to absorb 
all his thoughts. Nor was her curiosity 
excited on the subje6l of his marriage 
alone; she anxiously wished for an op- 
portunity of gaining from him some 
intelligence respeding the absent Henry, 
but felt herself unequal to particular 
enquiries by the abruptness of his an- 



t 159 ] ^ 

swers to any leading questions, and the 
solicitude with which he immediately 
changed the topic of conversation, 
whenever the name of Henry escaped 
her lips. 

One morning, however, finding her- 
self accidentally alone with Sir Charles, 
Mrs. Herhert determined to wave her 
fears, and asked him, whilst the tear 
started in her eye, whether he had '* any 
knowledge of the situation or fate of 
their brother r" Fitzmordaunt*s features 
instantly betrayed the most evident 
marks of agitation, and casting a fierce 
and penetrating look at his sister, that 
for a moment quite embarassed her, 
* What,' cried he, ' is the meaning of 
this persecution?' ** Excuse me," said 
she, ** I ought not to have introduced 
so painful a subject, but my heart was 
full of it. Oh! he was so kind, so 
affectionate a brother to me ! No length 
of absence can destroy the recolleclion 



[ IGO ] 

of his goodness, or obliterate impres- 
sions which early attachment engraved 
so deeply on my mind Besides, the 
uncertainty of his present situation; the 
imjsteiy that seems to haug about his 
fate." 

^ Mystery r repeated Sir Charles, with 
quivering h'p and face of deadly paleness. 
Alarmed at his emotion, ]\Irs. Herbert 
exclaimed, " wherefore these marks of 
agitation, Sir Cluirles? Is Henry indeed 
lost to us? Are you acquainted with his 
melancholy fate? Reveal it to me, I con- 
jure you 1 I am now prepared ^ovtht worst 
tidings!" ' Of what do you suspect mer' 
returned the baronet, in a voice scarcely 
articulate. '' Suspect you!" returned 
Mrs. Herbert in a tone of astonishment; 
but pausing for a moment, she proceeded 
• — ^' of nothing, — but the wish to spare 
me pain, by concealing from my kno\v> 
ledo-e some dreadful truth." 



[ 161 ] 

This declaration seemed to lessen his 
l^erturbation; a moment's recollection 
restored his composure, and advancing 
towards his sister, Sir Charles taking 
lier hand, entreated she would spare 
him on a subject most distressing to his 
feelings. ' Your zuo7^st fears, however, 
my dear Caroline, are but too well 
founded. Henry T — *' Is our dear bro- 
ther then really deadF' interrupted ]Mrs, 
Herbert. Averting his face from her 
eagerly enquiring eye, Sir Charles in a 
solemn tone replied, * Henry is indeed 
lost to us for ever.' 

]\Irs. Herbert breathing with diffi- 
culty, sank back in her chair. * Henry is 
lost to us for ever,' was the only sound 
that vibrated on her ear, it was the only 
idea that filled her mind, and rendered 
her unconscious of Sir Charles having 
abruptly quitted the room when lie had 
pronounced the awful sentence. 



[ 162 ] 

When the first overflowings of afflic- 
tion were in some measure assuaged, 
recolledion naturally presented to Mrs. 
Herbert's mind the manner of Sir Charles 
during their conversation. The changes 
of his countenance, the incoherence of 
his expressions, his wild look and tre- 
mulous voice, were all unintelligible; and 
only convinced her that something inex- 
plicable veiled the fate of her favourite 
brother, to which Sir Charles was privy, 
b\it did not wish her to enquire about or 
penetrate. She concluded indeed that 
the recolledlion of his own coldness 
and unkind behaviour to a brother who 
had merited only affeclion and esteem, 
might be one source of the distress which 
he had just manifested, and account in 
a great measure for the secret gloom 
which marked the general habit of his 
mind, and which from the time of this 
conversation seemed to be increased. 
Sir Charles was now constantly reserved 



[ 163 ] 

and silent; he joined the circle in the 
drawing-room as rarely as was consistent 
with politeness; and anxiously avoided 
a second tete-a-tete with his sister. 

Lady Antoinette, on the contrary, was 
the admiration of every visiter, and the 
life of every party. Her objed; was to 
attradl attention, and she generally suc- 
ceeded in it. Herbert was her shadow, 
and submitted to her whims and caprices 
with the most ready compliance. If she 
sang, he listened in silent rapture. Did 
she play, his flute accompanied her harp. 
In her walks he was her constant attend- 
ant; and when she mounted her horse, 
he was ever at her side. The lovely 
Antoinette seemed to engross all his 
thoughts; and his neo:le6l of Mrs. Her- 
bert and her children increased with his 
attention to this fascinating French* 
woman. 

At length Sir Charles announced to 
the party hi"* determination to quit tliQ 



[ m ] 

Lodge, in consequence of letters tiiat 
rendered his immediate presence in Lon- 
don necessary ; an intelligence which 
Lady Antoinette received with undis- 
guised pleasure, as she w^as now perfectly 
disgusted with the insipid sameness of 
country society, and the dull routine of 
rural engagements. Nor Avas Mrs, 
Herbert less gratified by the information, 
as it afforded her a prospe6l of being 
freed from visiters whose habits and sen- 
timents were so little congenial with her 
own. Her gratification, however, re- 
ceived a severe check, by M\\ Herbert 
informing her that Edmund and ^la- 
tilda should with himself accompany 
their uncle and aunt to town, where he 
said it w^as his intention to place them 
both at public seminaries for education. 
This information was received by Mrs. 
Herbert as the death-warrant of all her 
fondest hopes. The principles of piety 
and virtue vrhich she had imbibed from 



t 165 ] 

licr mother, happily preserved her own 
mind from contamination in the per- 
nicious atmosphere of a great school; 
but she recollected with horror the sad 
effects she had observed in the minds of 
others, fromtheirpromiscuous intercourse 
with children of different tempers and 
opposite dispositions, all necessarily fol- 
lowing the same round of formal tuition, 
and all equally unattended to, as far as 
regarded the cultivation of the moral 
feelings, and the regulation of the heart. 
From the birth of her own children, 
she had determined to educate them 
under her immediate observation. She 
had thought much on the important 
subjeCl, and aided her reflections by stu- 
dying every popular v/riter on education; 
and thus digested a plan, wliich she 
flattered herself would fully answer the 
great end she had in view, that of giving 
Edmund and Matilda every necessary 
accomplishment, and at the same time 



[ 1^6 ] 

fixing' in their young and ductile minds 
those moral and religious habits, without 
which, she justly conceived, the educa- 
tion of a rational and responsible crea- 
ture could not be complete. Dr. Fairford 
had promised to undertake the entire 
superintendance of her son's classical 
studies, as well as to assist her in any 
other point on which she might be 
doubtful of her own abilities; and the 
extreme indifference of Mr. Herbert, 
who had ever paid less attention, if pos- 
sible, to her children than herself, left 
her no reason to apprehend from him 
any interruption to a plan from which 
every other difficulty seemed to be 
removed. 

Her astonishment therefore was equal 
to her distress, when Herbert communi- 
cated to her his resolution. But he had 
adopted it less upon his own deliberations 
than the suggestions of Lady Antoinette, 
who had repeatedly declared, that the 



C 167 1 

beauty and spirit of Matilda (between 
whom and himself she protested there 
was the most striking likeness) Avould be 
entirely ruined in the stupid repose of 
her present situation, for want of that 
enlivening polisli which a more fashion- 
abl3^-regulated education only could be- 
stow. With respecl to Edmund too, she 
had frequently observed, that if his 
father wished him to become a pedant 
or a clown, he could not decide better 
than to let him remain under the care 
of his mother, and the tuition of a 
country parson ; but if on the contrary 
he really wished to see his son as elegant 
as himself, he would immediately remove 
him from a situation where he would be 
effectually excluded from every advan- 
tage that could polish and refine him. 

It was this artful flattery of I.ady 
Antoinette, that led Mr. Herbert to think 
on a subje6l, which had never before 
occupied a moment's consideration with 



I 168 ] 

him ; and having once decided accord- 
ing to her advice, he became positive 
in carrying his plan into immediate 
execution. 

In vain did his wife urge every argu- 
ment in favour of her own system; 
in vain did she represent those ob- 
J€6i:ions Avhicli had occurred to her own 
observation and refleclion against the 
popular schools he had mentioned. 
Herbert was deaf to argument, and im- 
penetrable by entreaty. *' He had re- 
solved," he said, *' that the spirit of his 
children should not be damped, their 
minds contraded, and their prejudices 
fixed, by the confined notions of such 
preceptors as they would find in the 
Forest. He meant his boy for action, 
and his girl for conquest, and would not 
therefore suffer them to be stupiiied by 
the dull rules of domestic tuition. They 
were not p/e^d'/rtr/zi', nor intended for the 
drowsy scenes of retired life; but born 



t 1S9 ] 

to fill a certain rank in society, and he 
was resolved they should have that sort 
of education which might qualify them 
for condu61:ing themselV'es with proper 
eclat in the sphere they were destined 
for. "^ This is only to be acquired," 
added he, ^' at those public seminaries, 
where they will gain more knowledge of 
the world in six months, than your 
system, Caroline, would furnish them 
with in half a century." 

' Heaven forbid,' replied INIrs. Her- 
bert, * tliat the yet unformed minds of 
my children should be entrusted to the 
care of those instructors, who make ' a 
k?wzvledge of the' zvorld a necessary 
branch, or the glitter of superficial ac- 
complishment the principal obje6l, of 
education ; whilst every valuable qua- 
lity is either wholly neglected, or consi- 
dered only of secondary moment. ]\fy 
favourite writer's description of modern 
education and its effeds has always 

AOL. I. I 



[ 170 ] 

appeared to mc to be a masterly sketch, 
in which the strokes of the pencil of 
truth were full as evident as the tints 
of poetry: 

** AccompHshmetits have taken virtue's place, 
*< Atid wisdom falls before exterior grace ; 
«' We slight the precious kernel of the stone, 
«' And toil to polish its rough coat alone. 
*< A just depoitment, manners grac'd with ease; 
«* Elegant phrase, and figure form'd to please; 
" Are qualities that seem to comprehend 
** Whatever parents, guardians, schools intend ; 
"■ Hence an unfurnished and a listless mind, 
« Though busy, trifling; empty, tho* refin'd. 
*' Hence, all that interferes, and dares to clash 
«* With indolence and luxuiy, is trash.'* 

As reasonable and accountable beings, 
it appears to me, that the moral and 
religious principles of children should 
be the points chiefly attended to in their 
tuition ; and in my humble opinion, 
badly do those persons fulfil this impor- 
tant task, who fail to make the solid 
improvement of the 7nind the grand 



r m ] 

objecl to which all their instrudions may 
ultimately tend.' 

^' Prythee, child, a truce to your 
preaching," interrupted Mr. Herbert, 
M'ith peevishness; ^' it might be in cha- 
racter at the rectory perhaps, but it is 
here quite out of place. I neither mean 
my son for a puritan, nor my girl for a 
devotee. If, indeed,"' added he, with a 
sneer, '^you are desirous to try an expe- 
riment of nursery education^ and wish 
to unite the chara6ters of saint and 
school-mistress, let me recommend your 
adopted child to your attention. I doubt 
not she will do credit to your system, 
and prove as ivise and as accomplished as 
lier instru6iress. Let me, however, hear 
no more objedions to my plan with re- 
sped to Edmund and Matilda — that is 
resolved on, and you have only to pre- 
pare for their journey."' 

Under every occurrence which inter- 
rupted ])cr own happiness only,. Mr** 
I 2 



[ 172 ] 

Herbert had ever evinced an heroical 
firmness and Christian fortitude that 
prevented all complaint; but in the pre- 
sent instance, when the welfare and 
interest of her children were so deeply 
concerned, she felt it her duty still to 
expostulate and intreat. But Herbert's 
lieart was steeled against every solici- 
tation ; opposition seemed rather to 
confirm than alter his opinion, and he 
at length tore himself indignantly from 
her, after expressing in the sharpest 
terms that his determination was now 
not to be recalled. 

It would be difficult to describe the 
state of ^Irs. Herbert's mind in the in- 
terval between this conversation and the 
day of the children's departure. As yet 
she had never been separated from them. 
She had contemplated with rapture the 
gradual expansion of their intelle6l; she 
had marked with all a mother's joy, the 
features of excellence which their dispo- 



[ 173 j 

sitions displayed, and had found her 
highest gratiiication in tlie cultisation 
of their minds, and tlie improvement of 
their hearts. They were now to be 
plaeed in tlie hands of strang-ers, cold 
to their interests, and careless of their 
welfare; where the principles she had so 
carefully implanted in them, would bs 
allowed to wither away; the sentiments 
of piety she had so assiduously infused 
into their minds, be neglected, and no- 
tions of the most pernicious tendency, 
probably, be ingrafted in their place. 

As the moment of separation drew 
near, the acuteness of Mrs. Herbert's 
sufferings increased ; but though almost 
borne down with sorrow, she did not 
neglect the only duty which now re- 
mained, that of guarding her children 
against the dangers to which they were 
to be exposed, by repeating most so- 
lemnly and feelingly the lessons of 
virtue she had before taught them, and 



[ ^74 ] 

encleavouring to strengthen their good 
impressions, with every argument which 
maternal aiFedion, combined with good 
sense and piety, could suggest. 

The distress of the children on this 
separation was little less poignant than 
that of their excellent mother. When 
the dreaded moment of Edmund and 
Matilda's departure arrived, the little 
heart of Mary overflowed with grief, and 
she could scarcely articulate a last adieu, 
and express her hope that her compa- 
nions would not forget her for any new 
friends. Matilda hung upon her mo- 
ther's neck, and bathed it with tears; 
while she pressed Mary's hand, unable to 
return any answer to the sobbing child. 
Edmund strove to conceal his sorrow, 
and hastily brushed the tears from off 
his burning cheek. His little bosom, 
however, swelled v/ith emotion ; he 
gasped for breath as he embraced his 
mother; and when he received a sum- 



[ 175 J 

«ions to follow his fatlier to the carriage, 
lie again clasped his arms round the 
neck of his foster-sister, and burst into 
a passionate flood of tears. 

Never before had Mrs. Herbert sus- 
tained so severe a shock to her feelings 
as on the present occasion ; and she 
would have found more difhculty in sup- 
porting herself under so st:vere a trial, 
and in restoring her mind to any degree 
of tranquillity, had she not been aided 
by the affectionate exertions of IMar}-, 
whose principal study it was to divert 
her thoughts from the subject of tlieir 
mutual grief, and to supply' tlie loss she 
had sustained in the departure of Edmund 
and Matilda, by redoubling her own 
attentions to her revered benefadress. 

Penetrated by the behaviour of the 
little girl, Mrs. Herbert determined to 
improve the hint dropped by her hus- 
band, and pursue the sysiem she had 
formed, in the education of her pro- 



[ 176 3 

teg^e. To tliis purpose she immediately 
devoted a large portion of her time, and 
soon had the pleasure of perceiving, that 
the richest harvest of ripening virtue, 
was likely to crown the success of her 
labours. 

Mary, though yet unable justly to 
appreciate the extent of her obligations 
to Mrs. Herbert, became daily more 
gratefully attached to her preceptress, 
and more solicitous of contributing to 
her pleasure. This was the stimulus to 
all her exertions, the secret spring of 
tliat ardour v/itli wliich she applied to 
e^'ery branch of instvuciion pointed out 
to her, and of that alacrity with which 
she adopted every step suggested by her 
prote^lress. This enabled her quickly 
to surmount every difficulty that occur- 
red in tlie ]Dr(-gress of her education, 
and produced a rapid improvement that 
afforded !\Irs. Herbert the purest delight, 
and which, at the time of Henry's ai'rl- 



[ i7r ] 

val, had rendered little Mary as much 
an obje6l of admiration as of general 
interest. 



[ 178 ] 



CHAPTER VL 



A LTHOUGH Mrs. Herbert had clo- 
-*^ -^ thed her narrative in as few words 
as possible, suppressing as well as she 
was able, some of the most offensive 
particulars of her husband's behaviour, 
yet sufficient had transpired during the 
recital, to convince her brother she had 
been a great and undeserving suiferer. 

It was with difficulty he could suppress 
the different feelings by which he was 
agitated. His cheek now glowed with 
indignation ; he now started with appre- 
hension, and again melted with grief. 



[ 179 ] 

When hl^ sister had concluded her 
recital, '^you have not suffered alone, un- 
happy Caroline," said he, grasping her 
hand. '' Anguish, bitter anguish, has 
been the portion of your brother also ! 7b- 
morrow I will relate my tale of woe. 
Yes, memory shall once more travel over 
the scenes of past afflidion ; she shall 
once more also catch a glimpse of that 
transient joy, which cheated my dark 
fate with a momentary illumination, and 
then left me to eternal darkness. My 
wounds must bleed afresh ; but a sister's 
sympathy will drop a healing balm upon 
them ! Oh, that I too could soothe my 
sorrows with my tears ; but, alas ! their 
burning fountains have long been dry." 

It was not without impatience that 
Mrs. Herbert looked forward to the gra- 
tification of a curiosity, which had long 
been the restless, though secret tenant 
of her bosom ; but it was an impatience 
mingled with apprehension. 



[ 180 ] 

She dreaded the eifecl which the re- 
ciirrence of afflidive images might pro- 
duce on Henry's weakened mind. She 
was fully a^vare of his exquisite sensibi- 
lity, and already had occasion for alarm, 
in the starts of passion and symptoms 
of mental tumult which she observed to 
have been excited in him by any painful 
associations, however accidental. 

They were scarcely seated at breakfast, 
however, on the ensuing morning, when 
Henry began as follows. 

** I need not recal to your remem- 
brance, my dear Caroline, the vexations 
and sufferings we were both doomed to 
experience, even from our earliest years, 
in consequence of the tyrannical dispo- 
sition and malignant heart of that 
detestable monster, Avhom the bonds of 
consanguinity have made our brother. 
Nor need I pain your bosom by remind- 
ing you of the deep sorrow which we 
felt, when death deprived us of our inesti- 



[ isi ] 

mable mother; or of our keen mortifi- 
cation, when we discovered that by this 
event we were rendered dependant on 
the unfeeling and imperious Charles. 

'^ To me, however, this latter circum- 
stance was attended with causes of cha- 
grin, which you most happily did not 
experience; causes that aggravated be- 
yond endurance a situation in itself 
sufficiently irksome, and rendered my 
proud heart still more exquisitely sensible 
of its misery and cruelty. 

*' Vou probably recoiled, that Charles 
and myself were in France, when our 
father's sudden death occasioned our 
recal to England. I confess that I ex- 
perienced more pain and vexation at the 
news, from the loss of what it obliged 
me to quit, than from the event of a 
parent's dissolution, who had never won 
my regard by kindness or parental love, 

*^ The summons to England tore me, 
Caroline, from the object on whom the 



[ 182 ] 

affeflions of my soul were now unalter- 
ably fixed. Charles and myself had been 
introduced to the Marquis de Bourdon, 
a nobleman of hioh descent and consi- 
derable fortune; and possessing a large 
share of that pride of birth, caprice, 
and insolence, with which prosperity too 
often fills the mind. Adelaide was his 
only acknowledged child, (though he 
was said to have a natural daughter con- 
signed to a convent,) a girl of sixteen, 
lovely as an angel, but still more inte- 
resting to the bosom of sentiment, from 
the gentleness of her manners, the 
sweetness of her disposition, the delicacy 
of her feeling, and the purity of her 
taste. Her mother had been an English- 
woman and a Protestant, and devoted 
as much of her time as a declining state 
of health would permit, to the cultiva- 
tion and improvement of her daughter's, 
mind, whose progressive excellence had 
more than satisfied her utmost wish. 



[ 183 ] 

** The Marquis's coniieclion with 
England througli this lady had given 
him a prepossession in favour of our 
nation, and rendered him very accessible 
to the countrymen of his wife. 

** Charles and myself, therefore, were 
much at his chateau; and as his family 
pride was flattered by the intercourse of 
descendants from the l^orman line, fas 
he expressed it,) we received from him 
every marked and polite attention. But 
his hospitality proved fatal to my peace. 
At each successivx visit, I found tiie 
charming Adelaide become more aud 
more interesting, and her image still 
deeper impressed upon my soul. 

*^ Yes, Carol me, I soon discovered 
that I had yielded up my heart to the 
daughter of De Bourdon ; and that on 
her alone my happiness depended ! But 
oh! what terms can convey to you an 
adequate idea of my rapture, when I 
perceived, that 1 too was not indifferent 



[ 184 ] 

to the lovely girl ! In what dreams of 
fchcit}' did my soul indulge, when, from 
the suffused cheek, the trembHng hand, 
and the embarrassed manner of my 
Adelaide, I caught the delightful hope 
that her heart Avas mine ! With what 
unutterable joy did I hear the delicate 
confession of attachment breathed from 
her ruby lips ! What raoments of ecstacy 
did I experience, when my active fancy, 
buoyed up by the ardour of youthful 
inexperience, represented me as pos- 
sessed of independence, and openly so- 
liciting that hand, which cruel circum- 
stances prevented me from demanding 
at present from her haughty parent! 
Oh, wretched Henry ! how have your 
anticipations been realized ! Oh, how 
dark has been the cloud which succeeded 
to this transient halcyon of the soul ! 

*' I continued under these delusive 
impressions for some weeks, till they 
were at length suddenly dissipated in 



[ 185 ] 

a manner equally unexpected and over- 
Afhelming. 

^' I had one day been expressing my- 
self witli some ardour to my bi*other in 
praise of her, ^vhose image Avas ever 
present to my imagination ; when, in 
answer to my question, '* whether he 
did not think her lovely as an angel?" 
* Faith, Henry,' replied he, * if her 
heauti/WQrc unaccompanied by any other 
attra^^ion, it would not, in my opinion, 
be altogether irresistible; but, soleheiress 
as she is to the Marquis de Bourdon, and 
her more aOluent uncle the Count de 
Pence, //f<7/ circumstance I confess lends 
to tlic pretty Adelaide a charm, which 
rendei's her an ol^jecl of some attraction. 
However,' continued he with a signih- 
cant sneer, 'your thoughts need not be 
occupied on the subject; for believe me, 
lienr}', she is not within the reach of 
2i younger brother.' 



[ 185 ] 

" You will readiiy imagine, my dear 
Caroline, that my indignation was roused 
by tiiis mortifying and sarcastic speecli. 
I made, hov/ever, no reply; for alaTm 
predominated overanoer, and I instant! v 
inferred from his words so?nething omi- 
nous to my hopes, though the nature 
and degree of the danger did not imme- 
diately present itself to my mind. Alas ! 
little did I imagine that my worst of 
fears would be more than realized. 

** From the moment of this short con- 
versation, the sorrows of my fate com- 
menced. 1 immediately perceived a 
change in the Marquis's behaviour. He 
who had been hitherto all confidence and 
kindness to me, was now distant and 
formal. Adelaide too was seldom seen 
but at meals; and when my eyes Avere 
blessed with Iier presence, the marked 
attentions v.hicii my brothe; paid to 
her, and the warmth with which those 



[ 187 ] 

attentions were seconded by her father, 
Iiarrowed up my soul. 

** It is true, indeed, I had no reason 
to fear that the ardour of the one, or the 
encouragement of the other, would pro- 
duce any chano-e in the sentiments of 
Adelaide to my disadyantage. Of her 
affedions I was secure ; but at the same 
time I could not but foresee that these 
circumstances would raise such insur- 
mountable bars to the accomplishment 
of that eycnt, which my soul had with 
so much rapture anticipated, an union 
with tlie lovely daughter of De Bourdon, 
as must glye a mortal blow to every 
hope I had hitherto entertained on 
that head. 

** Whilst affairs were thus circumstan- 
ced, our summons for England arrived, 
and such was the vigilance with which 
Adelaide was v/atched by the Marquis, 
that I had only a momentary opportunity 
before we separated, of breathing into 



[ i88 ] 

h^reara vow of eternal constancy and 
undiminisliecl affection. 

'' You are sufficiently acquainted, 
Caroline, with the events of several 
succeeding months; with the imperious 
behaviour of our unnatural brother, on 
his succeeding to the fortune and title. 
of my father; and of the thousand 
methods by which he made us feel the 
dependent situation in v/hich we were 
placed; with the gradual decline and 
melancholy end of our in valuable motlier, 
which robbed us of our only remaining 
friend; and with the sid:)sequcnt intole- 
rable condu6l of Charles; a condu6l 
that drove me at length to seek for that 
independence in a foreign country, which 
his cruelty and parsimony denied me in 
my ow^n. 

*' You may also recolle(5l, Caroline, 
the sorrows of that morning of o-tir sepa- 
ration from each other, when, having 
procured a pair of colours in the 



[ rsg ] 

regiment, I left Fitzmordaunt-castle to 
embark, as 3^011 thought, for India, 
where I had received orders to join 
my corps. 

^'Alasl my sister, why did I then 
conceal from you the secret of my 
bosom ? Why did I withhold from the 
tried friend of my heart the story of 
my love, and the silent intention which 
occupied my thoughts? Ah! how many 
sorrows might such a disclosure have 
prevented ! Comforted by your gentle 
spirit, persuaded by your controuling 
mildness, and checked by your better 
judgment, I might have curbed the 
violence of my own passions, the way- 
ward didates of my own frantic will; 
and instead of plunging into ruin my- 
self, and (oh, horrid thought!) one 
infinitely dearer to me than myself, 
instead of being the wretched vidim of 
of agony and despair, I might now have 
been blessed with hope, and Adelaide, 



[ 190 ] 

mi/ vnirdered tvife I be still alive! Oh, 
my bursting heartand staggering brain." 

The emotions of Henry were for a 
while too violent to allow him to pro- 
ceed. For some minutes he sat in silent 
anguish, but at length recovering him- 
self, he continued — 

*' It had been my determination from 
the moment of getting my appointment, 
not to quit Europe without seeing the 
daughter of De Bourdon ; and I resolved 
to leave Fitzmordaunt-castle (under the 
pretence of the fleet's sailing) some weeks 
before it was absolutely necessary forme 
to be at Plymouth, that I might execute 
a plan, which I fondly supposed would 
effedually prevent a disappointment of 
my wishes in that quarter where 1 could 
least brook their being crossed. 

'^ Having therefore bade you adieu, 
I instantly em])arked for France from 
Southampton, and proceeded without 
delay to the chateau of De Bourdon. 



[ 191 3 

'* With the assistance of an ecclesi- 
astic, the confessor of the Marquis, 
whom I had before bound to my interest 
by an important pecuniary obligation, 
and who felt all the affeclion of a father 
for Adelaide, I speedily obtained one 
short interview with the mistress of my 
alFedions. 

''It was a moment of mino-led torture 
-and ecstacy; and during the tempest of 
passions which raged in my bosom, — 
oh, Caroline, how shall I excuse my 
rashness, or extenuate my folly r-^the 
scruples and objedions of Adelaide to a 
clandestine union were overcome by 
my impetuosity, and before I bade her 
adieu, our hands were joined in wedlock 
by the priest who had enabled us to meet. 

'' Through him too it was agreed that 
we should occasionally correspond; and 
*when I returned from India, which I 
vainly fancied a few years would enable 
xne to do with rank and competence, 



C 192 ] , 

the same good friend was to pave flic 
way with the IVIarquis for our forgiveness 
and reconciliation. 

" But let me hasten to the sequel of 
iny story. 

'^ During the first few months of my 
service in India, I heard with due regu- 
larity from my wife, and your letters, 
my dear Caroline, Avere more than once 
a cordial to my bosom ; but being sent 
far into the interior of the country 
with a detachment, as a check upon a 
rajah of suspicious fidelity, a year elapsed 
before further correspondence reached 
our quarters. 

'^ Letters at length arrived at the 
army; but ah! who can tell the anguish 
of my bosom, when I learned that thea*e 
were 7ione for me? Fancy, always most 
busied when adding to the sorrows of 
the wretched, painted a thousand fears 
and horrors to my mind, and determined 
me to throw up all my prospers where 



[ J93 ] 

I was, and instantly embark for Europe 
in search of my beloved wife. 

'^ With my customary rashness, I im- 
mediately disposed of my captain's com- 
mission, (for disease and warfare had 
already raised me to a company, ) vested 
the money in a house at Calcutta, put 
nivself on board of a returnino; India- 
]nan, and sailed to the Cape; where 
meeting with an American vessel, bound 

for in France, I took a passage 

in her, and in a ftw weeks was landed 
at a fishing-town, not twenty miles dis- 
tant from the castle of De Bourdon. 

*' Caroline, you know your brothers 
wild tumultuous heart, the power of 
his passions, the ardour of his soul ! 
Think then Avhat must have been his 
mixed emotions, his alternate hopes and 
fears, his ecstacy and agitation, when 
he found himself so near his heart's best 
treasure 1

^' By night I had reached the dwelling 
of Father Albert, the friendly priest who 
had united me to Adelaide. He pressed 
nie to his bosom with the tenderest 
aifeclioD, and welcomed me as one alive 
from the dead. 

'' From him I learned, that Adelaide 
"vvas well; though sad and disconsolate 
at the uncertain fate of her husband, 
from whom no tidings had arrived for 
twelve long months. 

*' lie also told me, that her distress 
had been increased, and her feelings 
still more harassed by the importunate 
addresses of my brother^ wlio urged his 
suit with all the overbearing vehemence 
natural to his character, in v/hich he v/as 
seconded by the threats of the ]\Iarquis 
to immure his daughter in a convent, 
unless she complied with the wishes of 
the baronet. 

'' He described to me, with all the 
feeling of tender sympathy, the anguish 



C ^95 ] 

and clistraifiion of my beloved wife, wlio 
v/as alternately agonized b}^ fears for my 
safety, and tortured with the solicitations 
of my brother, and the menaces of her 
father ; and concluded his narrative by 
uvg'ingjight, as the only means of saving 
Iku- from one or other of these horrible 
fates; promising at the same time to 
aid Avith his advice and assistance my 
plans for this purpose. 

'^ You must imagine, my dear sister, 
fori cannot describe them, the joys of 
that meeting, Avhich, through Father 
Albert, now took place between your 
Henry and his Adelaide. They were 
joys too exquisite to be permanent. Ah 1 
>vhy did I survive the happy moment? 

'' Let it suffice to say, that we folded 
to our bosoms all that each best loved 1 
Adelaide forgot her sufferings, and I 
remembered not the dangers to which 
she had been exposed. 
K 2 



[ 196 ] 

Reflection hov/ever at length returned, 
and pointed out the necessity of adopting 
some measures to avert the heavy cloud 
of destruction which still threatened to 
burst upon our future prospects. 

^' Ample time, indeed, was allowed 
for our deliberations, business of an 
important nature having summoned the 
Marquis to Paris, from \vhence he was 
not expeded to return for several weeks. 
Alas! the very circumstance which was 
most propitious to our views, by my 
unpardonable folly and neglect, became 
our ruin ! 

*' Satisfied with the constant society 
of Adelaide, which the friendship of the 
confessor, and the absence of her father, 
enabled me to enjoy, my time passed on 
in dreams of bliss, and I suffered nearly 
three months to elapse without taking- 
measures for an escape. 

^^ At length, however, I was awakened 
from my delirium by the stunning intel- 



[ 197 ] 

ligence, that an avant courier had arri- 
ved at the chateau, announcing the 
return of tlie Marquis on tlie ensuing- 
evening, accompanied by Sir Charles 
Fitzmordaunt. 

'' Though ahnost petrified by the 
news, I took instant means to accelerate 
our iiiglit; and in a few hours every 
thing was arranged for the purpose. 

" An Englishman of the name of 
Vincent, whom I had discovered and 
befriended in great distress, at the village 
where 1 lay concealed, and who seemed 
to p;;ssess every reconmiendation which 
honesty, simplicity, and gratitude could 
oifer in his favour, had appeared to me 
to be a proper person to engage as an 
assistant in my meditated undertaking. 
I had for some weeks therefore taken 
him into my service, and after, as I 
thought, proving his fidelity, had madly^ 
entrusted him with my secret. 



[ 198 j 

*^Yes, Caroline! fool, maniac that I 
was, I put myself, my wife, my all, into 
the power of a villain. 

*' By means of this man I engaged a 
a vessel to sail with us that night, to 
, on the southern coast of Eng- 
land; where I purposed to remain for a 
short time, till our nuptials should again 
be solemnized according to the rites of 
the English Church, and I had found 
a sequestered retreat for my Adelaide, 
^vho now promised to engage me still 
more closely to her love by making me 
2i father, 

*' In this seclusion, I fondly purposed 
to deposit my invaluable treasure, whilst 
I used every means in my power to re- 
concile the haughty Marquis to our 
union; and in case my efforts failed of 
success, to return to my beloved, and 
spend my life with her in humble con- 
tent, on a ^mall farm, which the pur- 



C 199 ] 

chase-monev of mv commission mio-ht 
enable me to settle in. 

** Every previous arrangement, as I 
observed, for our departure being made, 
we now only waited for Vincent, who 
was to take the small trunk which con- 
tained the jewels and wearing-apparel of 
my wife. 

'' A considerable time elapsed before 
his arrival, during A\hich v.e laboured 
under the most painfid suspence; a sus- 
pence but too ominous of the woes that 
were to follow. 

*' He came however, at last, and 
satisfied me for his delay by a plausible 
excuse. Little did I imagine the real 
caue of it. Bloodhound ! he was then 
laying the train for our destruction. 

^' After having taken an affectionate 
farewell of Father Albert, we reached 
the little port where the vessel lay, in 
safety; and though Vincent was urgent 
in his remonstrances against our embark- 



[ 200 ] 

ing iiiinicdiately, under pretence tliiit 
tlie situation ot my m lie rendered a short 
repose alter our rapid journey highly 
nesessary ; yet feeling anxious to quit 
the land of danger, she strongly ohjecled 
to remain longer on the hated siiore; 
we therefore instantly emba' ked, hoisced 
our sails, and before the morrow noon, 
were safely anchored in tlie harbour 
of .^-.^ . 

" Agitation, apprehension, and fa- 
tigue, had so affe^led the constitution of. 
Adelaide, that I deemed it indispensably 
necessary to settle her as speedily as 
possible in some quiet retreat, where her. 
mind and spirits might gradually recover, 
their customary tranquillity; an ef[e6l, 
not likely to be produced by the noise 
and confusion of a large maritime town. 

*^ I therefore dispatched Vincent, in 
-whom I placed unbounded confidence, . 
in search of an asylum of this descrip- 
tion; directing him, (as he was fully 



[ 201 ] 

apprized of our views) to take such lodg- 
ings as might suit us, arrange every 
thing for our reception, and return to 
' condLi6l us to the spot. 

" Ten days had elapsed, before my 
messenger came back; and however extra- 
ord^r.Iiyv such Z Icr,2"thcr.cd absence was 
in reality, yet to me his auk ward reasons 
for it were sufficiently cogent, for I had 
passed the hours in Adelaide's society, 
and was insensible of the number that 
had flown. Ah, days of bliss, how 
dearly were ye purchased! how soon 
did ye expire ! 

'* Vincent's description of the retire- 
ment wliich he had secured for us, a 
neat farm-house in the heart of the New- 
Forest, delighted our imagination, and 
impatient to be settled in it, we deter- 
mined to proceed thither without delay. 

'' But this sudden journey would not 
have tallied with the dire machinations, 
which, 1 have since discovered, the in- 



[ 202 ] 

fcrnal Vincent liaci been ^veaving for oar 
destruction ; he therefore contrived to 
defer our departure till late in the after- 
noon of the following day, 

*' At length we set out, and bade a 
cheerful farewell to the noisy scene of 
maritime bustle in which we had been so 
long confined. 

'^ The evening was clear and tranquil^ 
a sweet serenity and solemn silence were 
diffused over all the face of nature, 
which breathed into our souls a soft and 
pleasing melancholy. 

** The pains of absence which we had 
felt, the alarms we had experienced, and 
the dangers wc had escaped, formed the 
interesting topics of our conversation, 
and awakened in our minds a succession 
of tender emotions. 

**The tear of recollecled suffering- 
rolled softly down the cheek of Adelaide, 
and a deep sigh burst from her heaving 
breast. ' lie calmed, mv love,' said \y 



[ 203 ] 

whilst I gently pressed her to my lieart, 
' nor let a painful thought obtrude upon 
our present bliss. Fortune has done lier 
worst, henceforth our destiny's secure; 
nor will she deign to frown on those, 
whose lot is happily below^ her notice 1' 

*^ ' Stop !' exclaimed a voice in a tre- 
mendous tone: and in the same moment 
our chaise was surrounded by several 
liorsemen, m ith vizors on their faces, who 
rushed from an adjoining wood. 

'^ Adelai<le shrieked, and fell lifeless 
on my bosom; whilst I, concluding that 
we were beset by highwajmen, mecha- 
nically seized a pistol from the case with 
my right hand, (supporting my wife on 
my other arm,) and snapped it at the 
head of one of the ruffians, who had 
now opened the door of the chaise. 

*^ ^ \Vhat, ' exclaimed a voice from 
behind, whose hollow sound I knew to 
be Filzmordaunt's, ' ^\ilr thou, mon.^tcr, 
d.CA murder io thy crimes.^ "\Vilt thou 



[ 204 J 

kill tht father, after having robbed him 
of his datigliterf' 

** To describe my feelings in this 
tlreadfal moment, is beyond the reacli 
of language. In an instant my mind 
comprehended all the horror of my situ- 
ation. I saw that we were betrayed, 
pursued, and on the point of being sepa- 
rated for ever. 

** A storm of pcission raged within my 
breast ; my bosom was on fire, reflection 
fled, and I could only resolve to part 
with life rather than be torn from Ade- 
laide. " Villain, she is my wife," re- 
turned I in accents of distraction, and 
at the same time aimed the butt end of 
the pistol at another assailant, who had 
now opened the opposite door, and seized 
the arm of my senseless angel. The 
blow felled the miscreant at whom it was 
direded, struck his vizor from his face, 
and discovered to my astonished eyes, 
the countenance of Vincent. 



[ 205 ] 

'' Maddened with mingled rage and 
terror, I grasped him by the throat, and 
cried, ^ Hell-hound, thou shalt expiate 
this treachery.' 

*^ At this moment a pistol was dis- 
charged from the opposite door ; I saw 
its flash, and heard its report, but saw 
and heard no more!"
