CHAPTER I.
u Can falsehood lurk beneath so Fair u countenance r"
" Deceit and woman are the same, 'Tis said j but suie they are to blame To speak with such temerity; Ye fairest flowerets of the earth, To modesty the next in worth Is feminine sincerity." ON retiring from lord Arthur, Eleanor found herself so extremely agitated, that, she repaired to her own room, in order to compose herself before she appeared in the presence of lady Glendinning, who, she knew, was expecting her again in the vol. ir. b
drawing-room. As it was her ladyship who had informed her of lord Arthur's wish to see her, she lamented that her ladyship should happen to be at home on this eventful evening—a circumstance which hardly ever occurred. As she was aware she must be surprised at the strange conduct of lord Arthur, she dreaded to meet her penetrating gaze; yet it was unavoidable, and the lateness of the hour reminded her that she must join her. She adjusted her hair in the glass, which had strayed in waving curls down her cheeks in sweet disorder, occasioned by the pearly gems which had diffused their moisture over her face; and pressing her hand to her heart, she forced a smile into her countenance, and then with secret dread she entered the drawing-room, where sat lady Glendinning and her daughter. •" Well, Eleanor," cried the latter, "what lias my father had to say to you so long ? Mamma and I thought you were certainly retired for the night." " I could not have been guilty of such
ELEANOR. 3 rudeness as that," replied Eleanor, " par¬ ticularly as I knew lady Glendinning ex¬ pected my return to this room." " I must confess, Eleanor," said her ladyship, " that I began to think it some¬ what strange, though the conduct of lord Arthur is always mysterious, and nothing from him should excite my surprise; but I should hope, Eleanor, that no particular circumstance has occurred to disturb your peace. Your eyes evidently betray that you have been weeping. Wherefore then is the cause of this grief? Tell me can¬ didly, can I relieve it? Believe me, Eleanor, I feel for the unpleasant situa¬ tion in which you are plunged in this family, which is partly owing to the folly of lord Arthur, who, while he professes himself to be your friend, is the greatest cause of all your uneasiness " " Your ladyship surprises me," replied Eleanor. " To what can you allude in the conduct of lord Arthur, who has ever treated me with the greatest kindness?" R 2
« My meaning is this," replied lady Glendinning. K From the first moment of your unfortunate mother committing yo,u to my care^ I was touched with com¬ passion for your helpless state; and al¬ though I was torn with contending pas¬ sions, ye*t I resolved to protect you, to i:eav you with my own offspring, and to permit you to share in every advantage * with them. How well 1 have fulfilled the trust reposed in me, your own heart will tell you; but when I undertake a charge, I will scrupulously perform it; and had I been permitted to use my own discretion, all might have been well; but here, began tbe folly of lord Arthur, to which, I allude. He stepped in be¬ tween my privileges with you. For you, Eleanor, I have been neglected. You have been the sole object of his delight, while I am scorned and despised," > * Oh, .madam;' replied Eleanor* <c how does your just accusation wound, me! Yet, Heaven k my witness* that I am innocent of the cause of your complaint."
« I do not mean it as complaint," inter¬ rupted her ladyship. " You ought to know me better. I am above complaint; that is a weakness only to be found in those unblessed with fortitude or resigna¬ tion. Let fools weep, sigh, and lament in vain. I know a nobler method than complaint, and which I have adopted. True misery never vents her feelings, but in silence mourns her fate. It was not for the poor gratification of complaint that I made those observations to you; but re¬ verting to my first subject, it was to shew you, that the interest wliich I should take in your welfare is greatly allayed by the interposition of lord Arthur, who, by paying no regard to my feelings, prevents my bestowing on you that notice which I otherwise should. Yet, in the present instance, when I see you so evidently agi¬ tated, and lord Arthur in the same situa¬ tion, I think it but my duty to inquire the cause; and now, Eleanor, 1 leave it to your own heart to judge how far you ought to put confidence in me."
Eleanor was affected. There was a kindness in her ladyship's voice which won upon her. She was evidently agi¬ tated herself, though lady Glendinning always endeavoured to conceal her feelings under the mask of pride. " I will unfold all to your ladyship," cried Eleanor. " Your unexampled kind¬ ness to a poor unknown being like myself, -demands every thing at my hands. But before I proceed, suffer me to repeat my unfeigned gratitude for your unbounded generosity to me. Oh, lady Glendinning, suffer me to love you! The coldness with which you sometimes receive me is but an assumption—your natural feelings are disguised. Oh, you are wronged by many who deem you proud and repelling. Forgive this bold sentence," she added, fearing she had said too much; " but my heart is bursting with affection." " Forbear," cried lady Glendinning, in a voice of agitation; " do not talk in such a strain as this. I own myself possessed of a spirit proud and tenacious of my own
rights, nor do I wish myself to be thought otherwise by the misjudging multitude, who are incapable of rightly appreciating my conduct; and now wave this subject, and give me what information you think proper." Eleanor replied, by informing lady Glen¬ dinning, that lord Arthur had sent for her to converse on the subject of Robert, who, she was sorry to add, had cherished senti¬ ments injurious to his peace, and the dis¬ approbation of lord Arthur, who had drawn from her a promise never to listen to the addresses of Robert. In making this com¬ munication Eleanor thought she was jus¬ tified, as her ladyship must necessarily be much surprised at the behaviour of lord Arthur, and she wished, if possible, to avoid all appearances of secret communica¬ tions with him. X»ady Glendinning seemed pleased with her candid avowal, which she assured her should be sacred to her own bosom.—" I wonder," she cried, " where Robert is all this time. 'Tis a pity he should thus ex-
pose himself to the night air, after his ill¬ ness." " And pray, Eleanor," inquired Geor¬ gina, " where have you been all the evening ? I never knew you stay out so late. Lord Arthur was quite distracted about you." Eleanor again looked confused.—" I wont to the village," she replied, " and staid talking at my school-house with the governess of my little flock." The blushes which arose in her face did not escape the eye of lady Glendinning, though she made no comments on it; and in a short time after, Robert entered the room; his countenance still betrayed in¬ ward agitation; he cast a look of deep regret on Eleanor, who was also struggling with emotion. Neither of them spoke, when lady Glendinning, with much con¬ cern, expressed her fears at his staying oat in the night air. He made her a short reply, and ringing for lights, begged her ladyship to excuse him, and retired for the night.
Eleanor felt her situation peculiarly dis¬ tressing, as she was conscious she was the cause of his sufferings. Lady Glendinning continued to behave to her that night with great kindness, and she was grateful to her for this unlooked- for condescension, and she flattered herself that she might henceforth find a friend in her ladyship. Fate had,, however, ordained that, at the very moment of lady Glendinning having suffered herself to give way to the' natural feelings of her heart,, in compas¬ sionating Eleanor, that a circumstance arose to crush the good opinion she enter¬ tained of her integrity, and placed her conduct in so doubtful a light, as to cre¬ ate the most painful suspicions in her mind. The ladies retired early to rest that night;- and Eleanor, in the privacy of her own chamber, again gave vent -to her grief. Her mind was wholly absorbed ill painful retrospection, and it was in vain. she courted the blessing of repose. b 3
- Nor did this balmy sweetener of life be¬ stow its influence on the frame of Robert. He likewise passed the night in wretched¬ ness. The conversation with his father still vibrated on his ear. What could be the dreadful reasons he had to forbid his uniting himself to Eleanor, he could not define. He only knew that he had so¬ lemnly promised to give up all thoughts of her; and however dear it might cost him, he resolved to make the sacrifice, for tiie sake of his father; and in so doing he doubted not he should obtain the assist¬ ance of Heaven, who would sanction an act of duty, and assist a son in his endea¬ vours to please a parent. After a night of restlessness and un¬ easy sensations, he arose, and determined to convince his father of his wish to obey his commands, by assuming an air of com¬ posure, though very foreign to his heart- As it was late before he entered the breakfast-parlour, he found all the family at the table. Lord Arthur cast a look^of scrutiny on
him, while he endeavoured to pay the compliments of the morning; but when he addressed Eleanor, his voice failed him, and an expression of sorrow passed over his features. Eleanor was also visibly agitated, and lord Arthur beheld the starting tear in her eye. He could scarcely comprehend her conduct. She had unhesitatingly pro- .mised never to become the wife of Ro¬ bert, and yet she appeared embarrassed in his presence, and evidently was cherishing uneasy sensations. Her cheeks were pal¬ lid, her eyes had lost their usual lustre,. and dejection marked her countenance.. Lady Glendinning remarked, it, and in¬ quired if she were not well? She alleged a headache, occasioned by a night of bad repose. • " I fear you fatigued yourself last night," cried her ladyship, « with your walk." . " Were you out last night, Eleanor ?" inquired Robert. She replied in tlie affirmative. " I almost wonder I did not. see. you
then," he returned, " as I rambled to the village; and on my return I acci¬ dentally met with Mrs. M. the school¬ mistress, who inquired much after you, saying she wishes to see you on some of her" school business, and requested you would favour her by going down to the village. She says she has not seen you since the night of the rustic fete." While Robert was uttering this speech, all eyes were turned upon the unfortu¬ nate Eleanor, whose confusion was too pal¬ pable to escape notice. , Her colour came and fled. Her hands trembled with such violence, that she was under the necessity of returning her cup to the table. She' saw,-by the looks of all around, what she had to expect. She was convicted in a falsehood. The idea was agony to hei* soul, yet no way of excuse presented it¬ self. She felt her head swim; a sickness stole over her frame, and she leant back in her chair. Lord Arthur beheld her agitation with grief. That she should have deceived was
a source of great sorrow to him. He was now confirmed in his opinion, that she had been with lord Montalban on the pre¬ ceding evening. The same idea also arose in the mind of lady Glendinning, whose anger in¬ creased to rage, at Eleanor having thus deceived her, at a time too when she had felt inclined to behave friendly towards her. She now viewed her as an enemy to her daughter. In rivalling her with lord Montalban, the honour and dignity of her family were hurt, and on this sub¬ ject her ladyship was vulnerable to a fail¬ ing. She cast a look of scorn on poor Eleanor; while Georgina, catching up her brother's words, cried<—" So, Eleanor, you staid so long at the village last night, did you, and with Mrs. M. though my brother saw her after you were at home, ii seems! Oh, how bad an excuse you have made!" llobert looked at all with astonishment, as he was ignorant of the mischief which" he had made.
" Upon my word, Eleanor," said her ladyship, " you have reduced yourself to a fine situation, by this mean attempt to impose upon us all. Well may you shrink abashed at the voice of truth, which has thus accidentally sounded in your ears' Oh, how contemptible do you now ap¬ pear ! how are you lessened in my opinion, by thus having meanly stooped to assert a falsehood!" " Spare me," cried the affrighted Elea¬ nor. " If your ladyship knew my feel¬ ings, you would pity me while you con¬ demned." " What is the meaning of this ?" in¬ quired Robert. " What has my unfortu¬ nate speech brought upon Eleanor ?" " Lady Glendinning informed him, adding __" Twas a lucky chance which caused your meeting with Mrs, M. as it has taught me what confidence I can put in future in Eleanor, who has thus dared to impose upon me with a falsehood. But know, Miss Glendinning, I observed the blush of confusion which mantled on your
cheek last night, and which was alone sufficient to pronounce you guilty." " Be not too harsh, madam," exclaimed lord Arthur. " Eleanor is already pu¬ nished, I am convinced, by her own feel¬ ings. She will perhaps retrieve our good opinion by explaining her conduct, which at present certainly appears questionable." " I shall be very ready to hear it," re¬ plied her ladyship; " but I fancy it cannot be explained. - However, Eleanor, you heat- lord Arthur's wish, and we wait your reply. 5 " Eleanor appeared overwhelmed with grief and shame.— rt Oh, what will become of me?" she cried. " Could you but know the agony of my heart, it would in some measure allay your just resentment. I own myself guilty of the falsehood. I acknowledge it with pain, with shame. Think what I must suffer at this first de¬ viation from the sacred paths of truth, yet cruel necessity was the fatal cause." " No occasion can warrant a falsehood," interrupted lady Glendinning;. "but if
you value my future favour, reveal the truth. On that condition alone I may be tempted to pardon you." " Never," replied Eleanor, in a voice of firmness; "never; though it should de¬ prive me of all protection, I cannot re¬ veal the truth. I own all my fault in de¬ ceiving you, but I cannot explain the rea¬ sons. I am involved in a gulf of mise¬ ry. I see your resentment. I know you all despise me; yet I am innocent, Hea¬ ven is my witness, of any crime, save that of falsehood. Yet I cannot, will not ex¬ plain; even though you banish mefrom your favour for ever, though you spurn me as I thus kneel at your feet for mercy, yet, if you refuse it, I cannot reveal the truth." " This is downright contumaciousness," replied'her ladyship, with great anger, as she turned away from the prostrate Elea¬ nor. " This behaviour only further ex- Gites my resentment. Henceforth I will not listen to your vindication, even though yOu should wish to make it. I was not born to be trifled with by a base deceitful
girl, who, under the mask of innocence, is secretly undermining the peace of my family, by marring the interest of my daughter." This hint alarmed Georgina. Her bosom throbbed with anger, as she ex¬ claimed—" I think, Eleanor, you cannot expect much mercy; for you certainly do "not deserve it from the handti of mamma." Lord Arthur cast a look of displeasure on her.—" Barest thou decide where mercy shall be shewn ?" he cried. " Its soft re¬ freshing dews, seasoned with justice, should be distilled on every head; for oft beneath a saintly countenance a votary of sin may lay concealed, while he whorrt censure singles to brand with disgrace, or envy loads with blackening colours, may far otherwise appear, nay, turn out adorned with the stamp of good, if rightly scanned. Thus perhaps it is with Eleanor, who, however wrong her conduct is in deviat¬ ing from truth, is sufficiently punished, as her present distress evinces; and as one of your own sex, she claims your compas-
sion. Pity, Georgina, cannot be mis¬ applied ; 'tis so noble a feeling, that the bosom who acknowledges her divine in¬ spiration, never need be ashamed to own her impulse, although it even should be directed to an object deemed by a cold and unfeeling world as unworthy. You see before you a being, humbled by the consciousness of having committed a crime;, her feelings are already acute enough. Yours then should be the glori- . ous task of raising a sinking spirit, and by pouring the balm of kindness into her wounded heart, effect that which severity will never attain. To you, lady .Glendin¬ ning," he added, " this part of my address is applicable, as you also, by this violence, lose all hopes of confidence." '* I own, my lord," replied her ladyship, " your sentiments are just, were they ap¬ plied in a better cause; but, in admonish¬ ing Georgina, you seem to forget the unequalled conduct of Eleanor, to whose guilt it is we owe this dissension. But .encourage her, my lord, as usual—con-
demn my daughter, and excuse all faults in her; nay, even say, she is right in pur¬ suing the paths of falsehood." " No, madam," he returned, " far from it. Truth is a deity I must ever prize; 'tis the sister of wisdom, whose paths lead to everlasting brightness, purity, and joy. So far from encouraging Eleanor, I thus openly avow my displeasure at her con¬ duct ; but I trust she will never again re¬ peat it. Eleanor," he added, addressing her, at the same time raising her prostrate form, " never again quit the divine inspi¬ ration of truth; you see to what a con¬ temptible situation it has reduced you. Oh, never deviate from the voice of that first of virtues on no account whatever; it cannot be countenanced, however it may be excused." "And yet, my lord," she replied, "there are circumstances which sometimes arise to drown her heavenly voice. Perhaps your lordship has never known, by sad experience, the pangs attendant on a de~ cciver, who, violating all laws of truth*
stands forth armed with double power to crush the wretch within his grasp, who, listening to the tongue of falsehood and dissimulation, sinks beneath the blow." Lord Arthur looked on Eleanor with surprise mingled with confusion.—" What do you mean by this strange appeal ?" he cried. " Merely, my lord" she replied, " to coincide with you in the horrors attendant on falsehood. I forcibly feel its pangs, yet I cannot retract. I am its victim at present, and I can only repeat, that though I am banished from the favour of lady Glendinning, yet I can with truth assert, that however appearances may conspire against me, I am innocent of crimes. Yes, here in the face- of Heaven, who looks down indignant on all who depart from right, I solemnly avow, that my conduct and proceedings are such as Heaven would sanction. . A time may come when you shall all acknowledge it. Till that period arrives, I must appear as guilty; but oh, in mercy mitigate my punishment! Oh,
lady Glendinning, I once more sue to you for pardon. Oh, lord Arthur, pity me, plead for me, and likewise bestow on me your forgiveness!" " I know not how to reply to you," he returned. " You claim my compassion, even in the midst of my anger. You have deceived me, Eleanor, but I forgive you. Your own heart can best judge your mo¬ tives for so doing; and to that I leave you." Eleanor caught his hand.—" My lord,'* she cried, " I know not how to thank you. Would I could hut obtain the cle¬ mency of lady Glendinning, I should in¬ deed be most grateful." She timidly approached her ladyship, who, however, turned haughtily from her. -^-"* My forgiveness," she replied, " cannot be of any consequence. Lord Arthur has pronounced his, and that is quite suffi¬ cient, while you are sanctioned by him; but I unfortunately have too much re¬ gard for truths to overlook the* least dere¬ liction. Rut be under no apprehension,
X shall not condescend to question you any farther on the subject; and it is my command also to you, Georgina, that you make no more comments on this very ex¬ traordinary affair." "-Indeed, mamma," she returned, " I shall not^ of course, trouble myself any farther about it." Eleanor curtseyed in silence to lady Glen¬ dinning, and glad was she when her lady¬ ship, rising from the breakfast-table, gave her the liberty of retiring to her own room, where, throwing herself on a chair, she burst into a violent flood of tears.— " Sure fate has shed her worst influence on my devoted head," she cried. "Oh, why was * I born to be thus involved in misery and mystery ? Better had I perished in my infancy, and escaped the many ills to which I see I am exposed. Yet, wretch that I am, to murmur at the wise decrees of Providence, who alone can direct all things ' f for like the rushing deep, adver¬ sity pours all its billows on the defenceless head. Yet, hushed be all complaints;
ELEANOR. 23 , God, even in the storm, presides equally as in the calm; even our present woes may be connected, with bur future bliss. Then dare I, a mere creature of an hour, murmur at the wise purposes of Heaven ? Oh, no, rather let me bless the chastening hand that lends her stroke of adversity for our finite good, and in placing a full reliance on the wisdom of a Supreme Being, bear with fortitude all the ills at¬ tendant on this transitory state, and in the consciousness of virtue and integrity, look with confidence to that Almighty Power who knows, and will, in all due season, set forth my innocence."
CHAPTER IL 4-+rr+r*+ ****** Of all affliction taught a lover yet, 'Tis sure the hardest science to forget. • Unequal task a passion to resign, ■ For hearts so touch'd, so picrc'd, so lost, as mine. Pope. These lines fully convey the feelings of Robert under the present trial, for though he had resolved to banish the idea of Eleanor from his bosom, yet the task was so difficult he could scarcely sustain it.' The incident of the morning had given rise to strange sensations within his mind. He heard lady Glendinning and his sister repeat their suspicions that Eleanor had been with lord Montalban on the preced¬ ing evening; and this assertion he also believed to be true. This idea caused him fresh sorrow; for to think that Eleanor really loved another was distraction, al¬ though he had no hopes himself. This,
he thought, accounted for the coldness of Eleanor towards him, and he looked upon lord Montalban as his rival. These, thoughts he however soon banished from his mind, and gave place to more generous ones. Eleanor could never be his, and lord Montalban was every way deserving of her. Yet he feared she was plunged in a gulf of misery, as he was aware that the friends of both parties would be averse to their union. He trembled for the hap* piness of his still dear Eleanor, and he resolved to watch over her with unremit¬ ting zeal; and he at length almost brought himself to think he could see her united to so worthy an object as lord Montalban. His sister Georgina must be the sacrifice, it was true; yet, as far as he could judge, he did not think it would affect her, save in the instance of wounded pride and dis¬ appointed vanity. In these conjectures he was perfectly right Georgina felt no preference for lord Montalban, but she had willingly re- VOL. II. c
ceived the proposals made for him, under the idea of pomp and ambition, to which principles she was a willing votary, hav¬ ing had it inculcated from her earliest youth by lady Lenox, that she must keep up the ancient dignity of her house. She had therefore already looked upon lord Montalban as her intended husband, and it was with sentiments of disdain and re¬ sentment that she now looked upon Elea¬ nor ; and with her mother she continued to vent the most bitter invectives against the duplicity of Eleanor. Lord Arthur heard them in silence. He felt he could not exculpate her, though he had endeavoured to vindicate her con¬ duct ; and he was himself seriously dis¬ tressed at her having endeavoured to de¬ ceive all parties. Lady Glendinning, at a very early hour, ordered her carriage, and taking Georgina with her, paid a visit to lady Lenox, and in a short time the whole of the preced¬ ing scene was related, and the conduct of poor Eleanor finely imprecated.
Georgina, in the resentment of the moment, was the most violent in her in¬ vectives, adding her firm belief, that she was injuring her with lord JMontalban, ivith whom she, of course, must have been on the evening before. Though lady Lenox was highly en raged at this supposition, yet her malig¬ nant heart rejoiced at this event having happened, as there was now proof suffi¬ cient to work upon in the conviction of the falsehood of Eleanor, upon whom she now vented the most bitter invectives; and by her artful observations succeeded in gaining lady Glendinning over to her opinion, who, already wounded by the conduct of Eleanor, soon yielded to the arguments of lady Lenox, who at length declared, that the girl must be effectually removed from the sight of lord Montal¬ ban, who would otherwise, perhaps, have the folly to disgrace himself, and ruin his family, by marrying her—" And sooner," continued her haughty ladyship, " than c 2
she should have such a triumph as that over my granddaughter, I would assist in any steps to effect her removal." " That is not possible," replied lady Glendinning; " you know lord Arthur will not suffer her to leave the castle without his own or my protection, or she might else have accompanied Mrs. Conway to London." " True,'" returned lady Lenox; " and Mrs. Conway shall still be made the in¬ strument in this business. A journey to London can easily be effected; and under your protection Eleanor must be safe, and lord Arthur to this can make no objec¬ tion. Mrs. Conway will be eager enough to have her on a visit. We can return again to Scotland; and no doubt, when she is there, out of the sight of lord Mont¬ alban, he will soon come to his proper senses; and all will then be well." Georgina, who wished for some re¬ venge on Eleanor, immediately second¬ ed this proposal, to which lady Glendin¬ ning replied—" She had no objection, as
it did not appear in any ways to the in¬ jury of Eleanor, whom," she added, " she did not wish to wrong, although she had deceived her," Lady Lenox chided her daughter mi¬ ner weak clemency against a base designing girl, " who," she added, " would be the means of ruining the whole family, if not removed, as if she failed in her arts with lord Montalban, she would succeed with Robert, who was also mad enough to be in love with her; but I am determined," she added, " to find out whether she was with lord Montalban last night; and if she was, I will expose her finely to lord Arthur, and he dare not vindicate her for telling a falsehood, to the injury of Ms own daughter" Lady Glendinning sighed as she shook her head incredulously, while Georgina related the full particulars of his having reprimanded her for her severity to Elea¬ nor. Lady Lenox sympathized with her on
his sad behaviour, and again declared the London scheme should be effected. Charles Lenox now entered the room, and was made acquainted with the busi¬ ness of Eleanor, which, though it greatly surprised him, he tried to extenuate, by supposing it merely a trifling incident, which his favourite did not wish known. Lady Lenox was highly enraged with him, but consoled herself with the idea of accomplishing the plan which she had in l iU} -idea, and in arranging circumstances to promote it. It was agreed between the ladies to keep their intentions entirely secret,, until they saw an opportunity to effect it; and on lady Glendinning and Georgina quit¬ ting lady Lenox, she ordered her carriage to B------ House. Her bosom friend, lady Cecilia, .was at home, and received her alone in the draw¬ ing-room, where, almost with her first breath, lady Lenox informed her of the shameful conduct of Eleanor; and as no
tale ever lost in the repetition of an artful woman, so was it highly exaggerated in the present case, and Eleanor was laid out as the most worthless of her sex. She concluded her detail by affirming her be¬ lief that she had been with lord Montal¬ ban, at the same time inquiring whether he w T as from home at the time. Lady Cecilia replied that he was, hav¬ ing asserted that he was * engaged with some male companions; " but," she added, " it is now clear that he was with Elea¬ nor." And her rage knew no bounds at this idea; she vowed, that if he did not immediately consent to have affairs put en train for his union with Georgina, she would for ever banish him from her fa¬ vour, and leave his father and him to their fate. This well-disposed lady now rung ! for a servant, and desired the presence of lord Montalban, who was in the library read¬ ing ; and it was agreed that lady Lenox should repeat the story before him, when
they should judge by his countenance how far their suspicions were right, and if they should have been mistaken, it would be an excellent opportunity of displaying the guilt of Eleanor to him. In a short time his ltfrdship entered the room, and bowing gracefully to lady Le¬ nox, paid her the compliments of the morning, and then politely inquired after the health of the ladies at St. Michael's Castle. This was a right subject for lady Le¬ nox to take advantage of, and she replied by saying-*--" that lady Glendinning and Georgina were well in health, but greatly disturbed in mind, by the base conduct of the worthless Eleanor, who had that morn¬ ing been convicted in a falsehood, as gross as it was glaring." At the name of Eleanor lord Montal¬ ban crimsoned, and hearing her spoken of in such a 'manner, his emotion became too visible to escape observation, and confirm¬ ed the pair before him in their suspicions.
He inquired into the nature of the com¬ plaint against Eleanor, which was duly repeated to him, with the addition of hints thrown out respecting her having been with some favoured -lover. This allusion was not understood by his lordship, who, in ignorance of their real meaning, heard this account with agony; and his confusion was so apparent, that lady Cecilia could hardly conceal her rage, as she was convinced that lord Montalban had been with Eleanor; while his lordship was all anxiety to know mere respectmg her. The present scene he would patient¬ ly have borne, ! had he indeed had the hap¬ piness of being with Eleanor the preced¬ ing evening; but this was not the case, and the thought of her having been with another lover was distraction to his soul. Lady Lenox continued in her abuse against Eleanor, till lord Montalban at length exclaimed—" I am perfectly asto¬ nished at all this, and can scarcely believe it, although spoken by your ladyship; for c3
I had considered the lovely Eleanor to he a pattern of virtue and integrity. Nor can 1 think otherwise, though appearances are against her." " Oh, to be sure," cried lady Cecilia, " you doubtless think her conduct very right; but however, my lord, I insist, from this moment, you banish all ideas of her from your mind, or you know my power, which I will immediately exert towards your father and yourself." Lord Montalban inwardly despised the mean allusion of his imperious aunt, but, for the sake of the marquis, he forbore to resent it. He therefore replied—" I know not why, madam, you should direct this discourse to me. I have already promised to comply with your wishes, in respect to visiting at the Castle of St. Michael's; and I trust the time will arrive when all things shall take a happy conclusion." Lord Montalban sighed as he spoke. His aunt was pacified with this an¬ swer, though she had little reason, if she had understood his real meaning.
Lady Lenox now addressed him, by inquiring when he meant to visit the cas¬ tle, saying, she thought him rather remiss in his attendance; for which he excused himself, by alleging, that so many old friends had engaged him since his return to Scotland, that his time had been taken up in returning visits, but promised to make up for the deficiency. He indeed wished to frequent the cas¬ tle, in order that he might behold Elea¬ nor, whose lovely form still reigned in his bosom; but situated as he was, he was under the painful necessity of using dissimulation with his imperious aunt, while he inwardly hoped something might transpire to favour his wishes with Elea¬ nor, if he could succeed in gaining an in¬ terest in her heart; but how was he shock¬ ed at the intelligence communicated by lady Lenox, respecting her having been out the evening previous with some sus* pected lover! He was determined, if pos¬ sible, to ascertain the truth, and if he really found it was so, he would endeavour
to banish her from his heart, and, in com¬ pliance with his friends wishes, v/ed Geor- rgina, as in that case he should be indiffer- sent*as to his future fate. During the stay of lady Lenox he re¬ mained so melancholy and abstracted, that it was imputed by the ladies to a con¬ sciousness of ihis own duplicity with re¬ gard to Eleanor.; and lady Lenox took the opportunity of'communicating to her dear friend, lady Cecilia, the scheme she -had in contemplation to rid them all of Eleanor. Lady Cecilia highly approved of it, and added—" She would do any thing in her power to promote it, if ^occasion required;" and after some further conversation, lady Lenox took her leave. Meantime the innocent victim of their machinations was passing her hours in solitude and grief. Lord Arthur, on the departure of lady Glendinning and Georgina, had sum¬ moned Jthe trembling Eleanor to his pre¬ sence, where, after seriously addressing
her on the subject of the morning, he begged her to .reveal to him the truth, assuring her of his forgiveness. Eleanor, with great agitation, heard him out, and only replied by saying— " That she fully acknowledged her crime.; but however guilty she might appear, she could not reveal the cause; that a most sacred promise had passed her lips for silence, which she was resolved to main¬ tain ;" and lord Arthur, though inwardly displeased, was obliged to give up the point Eleanor's situation in the castle was now very unpleasant. Looked upon by all as a deceiver, and treated with haughti¬ ness by lady Glendinning, as soon as the shades of evening drew in, she left the castle, alleging her delight in a solitary ramble. This did not pass unnoticed by all the family, and likewise by lord JMontalban, who, -pursuant to -his promise, made his visits more frequent, in the hopes of,gain¬ ing an interview with Eleanor in private:
but this he found impossible; and he wit¬ nessed, with silent distraction, the nightly rambles of Eleanor from the castle, while it had a very different effect on the ladies, who beheld that lord Montalban could not be with her, while he was paying his compliments to them within the walls of St. Michael's. This conviction caused them the greatest satisfaction, and accord¬ ingly they looked upon his lordship with more complacency; and lady Cecilia again smiled upon her darling nephew. Georgina tried all her powers to cap¬ tivate him, and began to construe his lord¬ ship's natural politene?s into warmer senti¬ ments; while his whole thoughts were directed to Eleanor. If he found himself in her presence, his eyes were involuntarily fixed upon her, with such a tenderness of expression, that could not fail of being understood by our susceptible heroine, whose blushing cheek indicated a senti¬ ment of feeling equal to his own ; but all explanation was impossible. He never saw her but in the presence of others; and
of an evening she always withdrew for the purpose of walking. Lord Montalban had more than once endeavoured to meet with her, but could never succeed, and he remained in the most tormenting state, between hope and fear, despair and doubt. In a very short time a packet was de¬ livered to lord Arthur from Mr. Conway, which contained a letter from sir Henry, thanking him for his friendly interference towards his nephew—*' To whom," he add¬ ed, " he was with pleasure reconciled, upon his promise of amendment; and that he hoped he would make a proper return for the generosity of Mrs. Conway, whom," he added, " he had received as a part of his family." There was also a letter from Mrs. Con¬ way to Eleanor, in which she informed her, that her father was easily reconciled to her on her return, particularly as he found that such genteel people had inte¬ rested themselves in her welfare, and that she was now happily settled with her dear
Mr. Conway, in her sweet cottage at Camberwell; and concluded by again pressing Eleanor to visit her, if possible. This communication was heard with pleasure by lady Lenox, who resolved that "the invitation should be accepted as soon as possible. Accordingly lady Glendinning began by throwing out vague hints, that she should shortly visit London, and treat her family with a sight of the metropolis; and lady Lenox also declared she would accompany her. Lord Arthur heard it with silence, as he was not as yet aware of their full in¬ tention; and with the actions of lady Glendinning he had long since ceased to concern himself. It was in a few days after this period, that lady Cecilia Gray, with lord Montal¬ ban, called for a morning visit Eleanor was present in the drawing-room, and lord Montalban, after bowing to the other ladies, addressed her in terms of the ut¬ most cordiality. His heart was in his
mouth, but restrained by the presence of others, he could only look unutterable language. Eleanor blushed " celestial rosy red," and heaving an unconscious sigh, with¬ drew her eyes in soft confusion. Lord Montalban beheld with rapture this tender emotion, and flattered himself that he was not viewed by her with indif¬ ference. The idea exhilarated his spirits, and he conversed with the greatest cheer¬ fulness. He was soon however checked in his gaiety by his aunt, who, on taking her leave, gave a pressing invitation for the whole family to dine at B------House in a few days, and invited lord Arthur so very much, that he could not consistently re¬ fuse; and for the first time since his illness he promised to attend a party out. Lord Montalban heard lady Cecilia se¬ parately name every one, except Eleanor, whom she pointedly left out. His feel¬ ings were risen to agony at this fresh in¬ sult, but he dared not interfere; and on
taking his leave, he heard, with mortifica¬ tion, the promise repeated, of the family diring on the appointed day at B------ House.
CHAPTER III. " 'Tis t>he far off, through flames of fire." " Then turn to me, my own love, turn, Or else «kh thee I'll fade and burn. Ah ! she falls! she sinks! as dies the lamp In charnel airs or cavern damp. 1 ' " Had some kind angel op'd the book, And let me read my fate, my heart had bun>f When it beheld the ills, which, one hy one, , I have endured." Eleanor, though inwardly hurt at re¬ ceiving such a slight from lady Cecilia, was glad that she was not to be of the party, as it was a painful task to her to be in the presence of lord Montalban; to as¬ sume an indifference foreign to her heart, to treat him with coldness and reserve,
when every softer feeling of her soul was his, were pangs which she could scarcely sustain, and she could no longer deny to herself the impression he had made on her. She was indeed at this period an object of commiseration; torn by contending pas¬ sions, and exposed to the various machi¬ nations of her enemies, she was no longer the gay, the blooming Eleanor; the rose forsook her cheek; her eyes lost their vi¬ vacity, and gave place to a pensive soft¬ ness which thrilled through the soul. Lord Montalban beheld the change with the quick eyes of love, and sometimes flattered himself that he was the cause of her dejection; yet he would reflect on the adventure of the fatal evening, when the falsehood of Eleanor had been so openly avowed; and he tormented himself with the idea of the favoured lover, with whom she was suspected to have been. He would have given worlds to have obtained a conversation with her, but found it im¬ possible, as she avoided him when he visited the castle, and to see her alone was
impracticable; for if the family were out of an evening, and he inquired for Elea¬ nor, he also learnt from the servants that she was gone out for a walk, and alone. - This confirmed his lordship, that she must have some private engagement or other, which was a bar to his hopes; and one moment he resolved to banish her from his heart, and wed Georgina imme¬ diately, as his aunt and father continually persecuted him on the subject, and his home was rendered a seat of misery to him; and he considered it useless to 'dis¬ oblige his relatives, if he could not gain the regard of Eleanor. Yet still love pre¬ vailed over every other consideration, and he therefore for a while remained passive, neither promoting nor rejecting the ar¬ rangements by his aunt, who was continu¬ ally bestowing on him her advice; and on the day arriving at which the Glendin¬ ning family were to dine with them, she favoured him with a long lecture, as to his behaviour towards Miss Glendinning, whom she kindly insisted he should love.
Lord Montalban inwardly wished the day over, as to him it was only a visit of ceremony; for Eleanor, alas! was not to be present, and, what was still worse, she might possibly take the advantage of their absence to be with his supposed rival. At a late hour the whole party from St. Michael's arrived. With lord and lady Lenox, earl Campbell had also joined the party, in compliment to his son, lord Ar¬ thur, who, with painful compulsion, had once more accompanied his lady out. It was the first time he had left the do¬ mains of the castle since his indisposition, and he received the congratulations of the company ; but it was evident he felt them not; his whole soul was wrapt, as usual, iii melancholy, and his conversation was ab¬ stracted, and his mind evidently ill at ease. Lady Glendinning frequently east a look of scrutiny on him, and a rising 1 sigh stole from her breast, as she gazed on the sad remains of the once lively and elegant lord Arthur. With lord Montalban he appeared the most friendly, and to him
addressed almost the whole of his conver¬ sation, which was not lost upon the other company. Lady Lenox, -with her usual malignity, whispered to the ear of her daughter his visible neglect towards her, and vowed she would revenge her wrongs through Eleanor, who, once removed from his sight, she knew would be a source of un¬ easiness to him. Notwithstanding all disadvantages, the party did not break up until a late hour, when their respective carriages being or¬ dered, they took leave. Earl Campbell begged lady Glendin¬ ning. and Georgina to enter his carriage. Lord and lady Lenox departed -in theirs, and lord Arthur, with his son Robert, were proceeding to enter liis chariot, when their attention was caught by an alarm¬ ing light in the sky, and clouds of smoke were seen to curl in the air. Lord Arthur instantly inquired the cause, and was informed by the servants, that a most dreadful fire was raging in
the village through which they must pass in their way home. The ladies were much alarmed, as the gentlemen declared their intention of aid¬ ing the sufferers, if possible; and, lord Montalban, ever active in the cause of benevolence, stepped into lord Arthur's carriage, alleging his determination to proceed to the place of distress. Earl Campbell, too infirm to assist in such a scene, ordered his coachman to drive on as quick as possible to the castle, whither he would protect the ladies. His command was obeyed, but as they ar¬ rived at the spot of destruction, they found it almost impossible to pass. The flames were dreadful, and cottage after cottage was consumed by the rapidi¬ ty of the fire. Screams and piercing cries broke upon their ear, and lady Glendin¬ ning, almost fainting with terror and con- cern for the unfortunate sufferers, felt some degree of relief when she at length found herself past tho conflagration. Meantime the gentlemen leaving their
carriage, approached close to the scene of fiorror, and offered their assistance. One house which stood rather higher than the rest, was nearly enveloped in flames, the lower part being all on fire. " Lord Arthur inquired if the families were safely out, and was answered, one only female remained in, who had re¬ turned in great anxiety to save her pro¬ perty ; but all the people were now struck with horror at beholding her danger, as the flames had increased with such vio¬ lence that they feared she must perish. This account greatly shocked the gen¬ tlemen.—" Let us try some means for her escape!" cried lord Montalban : " the top apartment is yet accessible, if ladders can be procured." At this instant a female form was seen at the window—her whole appearance evinced symptoms of the greatest distress —her hands were clasped in agony, and her features were cast towards Heaven, as if in devotion—a shriek burst from her lips as the flames began to approach her—she
appeared like an immortal form ascending from a pillar of fire. All evinced their distress at her situation, when lord Ar¬ thur, stedfastly fixing his eyes on her, exclaimed—" Merciful Heaven! what do I behold? that form ! that face! 'tis she! Oh! save her! save her from her dreadful fate! / will save her or perish with her." He rushed towards the door, when Ro¬ bert caught his arm.-*--" Hold, my father! your destruction is certain, if you enter those walls." " Release me!" he cried, furiously. " I will die with her. You know not what I feel. My brain swims. Oh God! I sink —I fall!" He staggered a few paces, and dropped into the arms of his son, whose whole care was now for his father, whom he conveyed to the carriage; and lord Arthur, still continuing in a strong fit, Robert ordered the coachman to drive as fast as possible to St. Michael's. Meantime lord Montalban, on hearing VOL. II. D
the frantic expressions of lord Arthur, re¬ solved to isave the unfortunate female. He saw a ladder advancing. He hastily seized and placing it before the burning ruins, ascended it, and with the utmost intrepidity, and at the hazard of his life, reached the window. He caught the wretched female by the hand, and suc¬ ceeded in bearing her in safety down the ladder. The poor villagers beheld this heroic act with admiration, and received him with shouts of joy. Lord Montalban was, however, wholly intent upon his fair burden, who, in at¬ tempting to express her thanks to her preserver, fell into a state of insensibility. He supported her in his arms with the utmost tenderness, and at length bore her to a cottage at a small distance, which re¬ ceived her fainting form. No one ap¬ peared to know her: some asserted that she was the lady who lived so very re¬ tired in the village, unknown to any one.
Lord Montalban beheld that she had been lovely, even to perfection: ,her fea¬ tures were regularly beautiful, and when at length she opened her soft blue eyes, she appeared irresistibly fascinating. By degrees she recollected her true situation^ and poured out her gratitude to lord Montalban.—" Oh, God!" she cried, "to what farther ills am I to be exposed? Yet thy hand has again been stretched over my head. Merciful Heaven! just are thy ways, and grant that these thy wise dispensations may be impressed on my mind with true piety and resignation. To you, sir," she cried, turning to lord Montalban, " I know not what to say: I cannot express my gratitude; my tears must be my apology, for words are denied me." " Forbear, madam," he replied; " you are not in a state to talk; I have done no more than the duty of every man, who must indeed be base and degenerate, if he «ould behold woman, lovely woman, B2
in danger, without saving her, at ,the ha¬ zard of his heart's dearest blood." " You overwhelm me, sir," she cried; " but though you will not permit me to express my thanks, let me at least have the satisfaction of knovving the name of my brave preserver." " Frederick Montalban," he replied; " and be assured, madam, tliat any assist¬ ance which can be rendered yon will be most cheerfully granted, either by myself or the marquis of B------my father, who will truly feel for the calamity which has this night befallen his tenantry." " Is it possible," exclaimed the un¬ known female, " that I behoki lord Mont¬ alban ? Merciful Heaven ! how wonder¬ ful are thy ways!" His lordship looked on her with some surprise, and inquired if she had known him previous to that night, as he had not the happiness of being acquainted with her. " Only by name, my lord," she replied; " that has already reached my ears; for
what tongue in this village does not re¬ sound in the praise of lord Montalban! and oh! how gratefully shall I now join in blessing the name of my preserver!" Lord Montalban modestly shrunk from her encomiums, and proceeded to inform her, that another had also warmly inte¬ rested himself in her fate, and who had declared his intention of saving her, but, being seized with sudden indisposition, was prevented that happiness; " and " added his lordship, " this was lord Arthur Glendinning." He paused as the suffering female, in a voice of extreme agitation, repeated the name; and catching his arm, she cried— " Oh, tell me truly, did lord Arthur really behold me?" Her whole form was agitated ; her cheek assumed a deadly paleness, while lord Montalban replied in the affirmative; '*' but," he continued, alarmed at her situ¬ ation, " you are ill; you must not con¬ verse any more. Pray retire, and be as - sured, I will see you again in the morn-
ing, when I trust you will be more com posed, aud in the mean, time, say if I can inform any friend of your situation., Is there any one whose presence would be a source of comfort to you ?" " Alas !" she replied—" I have no fnends. I am a wretched outcast, isolat¬ ed from the world; therefore trouble yourself no farther about me. I am in¬ deed ill—I will retire; and rest assured, the remembrance of your lordship's kind¬ ness will ever dwell in my remembrance." She could say no more, her whole frame trembled, and the kind woman belonging to the cottage led her away to seek re¬ pose. Lord Montalban left his purse, in order for every necessary to be procured her, and then left the house. He returned to the fire, which was now abating, and he beheld all the sufferers safe from its de¬ vouring flames. He now thought of lord Arthur, and determined, late as it was, to go to the castle, and inquire concern¬ ing him. On arriving there, he found the
family in confusion. Lord Arthur was still in a state of insensibility, and lady Glendinning attending on him with the greatest anxiety. She was listening Lo the account given her by Robert, of the cause and strange expressions thrown oiat by his lordship for the unknown sufferer. She heard him in silence; a deep sigh only escaped her lips; but on seeing lord Montalban, she inquired if the lady had escaped. His lordship gave her the particulars, and added, he had left her in safety at a cottage. Her ladyship replied by saying she would visit her in the morning, and pro¬ cure her every possible comfort, Finding lord Arthur still continuing in his fit, lady Glendinning sent for medical assistance, and lord Montalban retired, adding, that he would attend early in the morning, to inquire after his lordship's health. Soon after his departure, lord Arthur began to shew symptoms of returning ani¬ mation, but on opening his eyes he fixed
them wildly on lady Glendinning, and then gazing round the room, exclaimed—- "Where have I been? Did I not be¬ hold her, or have my senses been disor¬ dered ? Ah. no! I recollect all now.* He added—" Oh ! tell me where she is? where is Eleanor ?" " Compose yourself, my lord," replied Jady Glendinning; " Eleanor is safely re¬ tired to rest, where she remains uncon¬ scious of your lordship's indisposition, as I thought it useless to alarm her." Lord Arthur put his hand to his head, as if to recollect himself.—" True, true," he cried ; " my head wanders sadly; but I would ask, if the wretched female was saved from the flames; oh, tell me has she perished ?" He evidently struggled to appear com¬ posed, but his agitation did not escape her ladyship.—" Make yourself easy," she replied; " she is safe; lord Montalban he¬ roically finished the work you began, by rescuing her at the hazard of his own life."
" Noble youth!" exclaimed lord Ar¬ thur; ."exalted Montalban! thou shalt find a reward for this generous action." He clasped his hands together—an ani¬ mated expression stole over his pallid face, when, as if suddenly recollecting himself, he turned to lady Glendinning—-" I fear," he added, " I have caused you much alarm and surprise by my conduct; but your ladyship will, I am convinced, enter into my feelings at the sight of a defence¬ less woman in such .an extreme danger, who, though a stranger to me, warmly interested me as a man; and I trust your ladyship will make allowances for the weakness wliich overpowered me, owing, I suppose, to my previous ill state of health." Lady Glendinning looked at him with mild dignity.—" Do not apologize to me. my lord," she replied, " for exerting your¬ self in the cause of humanity. I hope, throughout the ,whole of your lordship's life, you have ever been the staunch pro- d8
tector of a female when in distress, for, to desert a woman basely in the hour of dan¬ ger, suits not with the honour and charac¬ ter of a gentleman." . Lord Arthur dropped his eyes, and shrunk from her gaze. Her ladyship looked at him with such an expression, that it reached his soul. She sighed deep¬ ly, but recovering herself, she begged that he would retire to bed, and endea¬ vour to gain some repose. To this he as¬ sented, and wishing her ladyship ** Good night," he retired to rest. Georgina remarked to her mother that she thought his lordship's conduct very strange, to which lady Glendinning only replied, that it was the effect of alarm, she supposed, occasioned by the dreadful fire. She then took leave for the night, and entering her own room, gave way to her thoughts. That she had her own private reflections, the reader is already aware, as likewise that she never suffered any of those reflections to pass her lips. Meantime Eleanor, unconscious of what
was passing, was enjoying the balmy blessing of repose. She heard a bustle in the castle, but concluded it only to be oc¬ casioned by the return of the party; she therefore lay until her usual hour in the morning, and on entering the breakfast- parlour, awaited, until lady Glendinning and Georgina entered the room, when the latter began by inquiring if she had heard about the fire. Eleanor, ever alive to the woe of others, instantly inquired the particulars; but no sooner did Georgina repeat them, than the colour fled her cheeks; and with a falter¬ ing voice, she demanded the exact situa¬ tion of the fire; but, on hearing the ac¬ count of the unknown female, she clasped her hands in an agony of grief.—" Mer¬ ciful God!" she exclaimed, "and who saved her from her dreadful fate ?" As she spoke the door opened, and to their great surprise, lord Arthur entered: all had thought him too ill to rise, and lady Glendinning expressed her surprise at so unexpected a circumstance. He re-
plied by saying that he had risen early, in order to repair to the village, to see what could be done respecting the poor suffer¬ ers; while Eleanor, who was .evidently near fainting, repeated her question of who saved the lady from her dreadful fate? " Oh, a great favourite of yours," cried Georgina. " Lord Montalban it was who rescued her." " Lord Montalban !" repeated Eleanor; " merciful Heaven, receive my thanks /" She could say no more; her eyes closed, and she sunk senseless on a chair. Her emotion was of course attributed by all parties to her concern on lord Montalban's account, and the ladies were not well pleased at the conviction; particularly Georgina, who viewed the innocent Elea¬ nor as her rival, and in that character she of course h ated her. Restoratives were ap¬ plied to her, and in a short time she reco¬ vered her senses; but on opening her eyes, the first object she beheld was lord Mont¬ alban, who had just made.his appearance. On seeing the situation of his beloved
Eleanor, he hastened to her side, and in¬ quired the cause of her indisposition. Georgina rather spitefujly replied, that her feelings were so extremely fine, that she had fainted at the recital of the Are, occasioned, she supposed, by the danger to which his lordship had been exposed. Pleasure sparkled in lord Montalban's eyes at this assertion.—" Indeed!" he re¬ plied ; " 1 should feel much honoured could I believe that I excited so much in¬ terest in her bosom." He paused, as recollecting himself, he feared he had said too much; and at that instant Eleanor opening her eyes, he took her hand, and tenderly inquired how she found herself. On seeing him, Eleanor involuntarily uttered his name, and casting a look of in¬ effable delight on him, she pressed his hand, with a warmth that gratified the delighted Montalban; but suddenly recol¬ lecting herself, she became embarrassed : the colour revisited her cheeks, and her eyes dropt in soft confusion.
Lord Montalban read the feelings of her soul, and was of course gratified; though he was rather astonished at her behaviour, as she had of late kept up a continual reserve towards him. He knew not the sensations which agitated her bo¬ som at that moment. Pure as the moun¬ tain snow were the feelings of her heart, though enveloped in the cloud of mys¬ tery ; but Eleanor was the child of doubt and suspicion, and lord Montalban, with the warmth of a lover, only delighted in the conviction of her regard for him. Lord Arthur was also in a state of the greatest anxiety; agitation was depicted on his countenance, as turning to lord Montalban he took his hand, and bestow¬ ing on him the warmest applause for his brave exertions, he inquired to what place he had conducted the lady whom he had so fortunately rescued from the fire ? Lord Montalban replied by informing him of the cottage; " but," added he, " I have strange news concerning her, for, on going this morning to inquire as to her
health, to my great astonishment I found she had already quitted it." " Gone!" interrupted lord Arthur, in a tone of disappointment, while Eleanor, with quivering lips, in a faint voice, de¬ manded whither she was flown to ? " Of that 1 am in ignorance," replied lord Montalban, " and I must confess it is that part of her conduct which astonishes me. All I can learn from the people of the cottage is, that after taking about an hour's repose, she arose, though evidently in a weak and languid state, and thank¬ ing them for their kindness to her, said she must instantly depart. " It was in vain," added lord Montalban, " they pressed her stay; and at length ventured to ask her where she was going. She re¬ plied, that particular circumstances oblig¬ ed her to keep her retreat secret; and forcing on them a small reward, she begged, as the only favour they could do her, to tell lord Montalban, should he again visit her, that the remembrance of his bravery and kindness should ever
dwell in her heart—* Tell him,* she cried, ' not to deem me as ungrateful in thus flying from his presence; my sor¬ rows impel me to fly this spot, but in se¬ cret will I bless his name and pray for his happiness. Tell him my heart is burst¬ ing with the sense of obligation I owe him; bnt, alas ! I am not allowed the sa¬ tisfaction of personally thanking him.' This was all they could obtain from her, and before daybreak she quitted the cot¬ tage, and they remain in ignorance of her destination." " Good Heaven!" cried Eleanor, " where can she then have bent her steps ?" Lord Arthur looked on her with some degree of surprise. The power of speech seemed denied him, and he paced the room in silence; while lady Glendinning exclaimed—" You appear very interested, Eleanor, in this unknown person's fate. Rest yourself assured that she has her reasons for this strange conduct, and, per haps, it is better for all parties that she has thus withdrawn herself. Whoever
she is, she appears unfortunate, and Hea¬ ven, I trust, will bestow on her its firm support to guide her on her way." " I own myself greatly interested in her fate," said lord Montalban, " and I am confident she is not what she seems: her person was elegant, and though she was absorbed in terror, yet, in the transient view 1 had of her, 1 saw she was lovely in the extreme; and when the rose of health had adorned her cheek, I am con¬ vinced her countenance was beautiful." " Your lordship seems quite entranced with this unknown lady," interrupted Georgina ; " I suppose wc shall have you turn knight-errant, and wander about till you discover the enchanted castle to which your dulcinea has flown." Lord Montalban looked very displeased. —" No, Miss Glendinning," he replied, " I shall not attempt to intrude myself in her presence, nor endeavour to seek her out: as she has chosen to withdraw herself from our observation, I do not conceive myself authorised to seek her out. The senti-
ments she excited in my bosom were those of humanity, of which I trust I shall never be devoid, and when I see a woman in distress. I own myself susceptible in the extreme. That sex ever claims the warmest attention on our part, on account of the many ills to which, as the most delicate part of the creation, they are ex¬ posed ; and let no man style himself as such who would not risk every hazard to protect a defenceless female in the hour of danger. It was my fate to be the for¬ tunate instrument in saving the life of this lady, and I feel more than I can ex¬ press in the conviction of having at least in one instance done my duty." " And for which," interrupted Eleanor, "your lordship will meet your reward: the heroic action will be recorded in the book of heaven, and that Power who reigns there will smile on the exalted deed, and shed its choicest blessings on your head." Ail fixed their eyes on Eleanor, as in a firm tone she pronounced this speech.
They were astonished at Lei* warmth. She saw their surprise, and the courage which had lent her its support for a few minutes again left her, and she bent her eyes in soft confusion beneath the enrap¬ tured glance of lord Montalban.
CHAPTER IV.,
" What means then shall we try ? where hope to find A friendly harbour foi the restless mind ? Are these our great pursuits ? Is it thus to li\e ? These all the hopes this inuch-lov'd world can give ? How much more worthy envy is their fate Who search for happiness in a future state I" During the above scene, lord Arthur had remained a silent spectator, but it was evident not an unmoved one. He had continued pacing the room, until Eleanor addressed lord Montalban in so animated a tone. He then stopped suddenly, and fixed his eyes upon her. Varying sus¬ picions crossed his mind respecting her conduct, but the one most predominating in his bosom was the conviction of Elea¬ nor's regard for lord Montalban. He saw the impression was mutual, and from that
moment he resolved to befriend them as much as lay in his power. Lady Glendinning perceived the emo¬ tion under which all evidently laboured, and endeavouring to collect herself, she took her seat at the breakfast-table. Lord Arthur was, if possible, more me¬ lancholy and abstracted than ever : deep- dm\n sighs stole from his bosom, and just partaking of a small refreshment, he has¬ tily withdrew. Lord Montalban remained in conversa¬ tion with the ladies, but as soon as possi¬ ble Eleanor left the table, and, to the great disappointment of his lordship, she quickly letired from the room. Ever ac¬ tive iu the cause of disticss, Eleanor has¬ tened to the village, in order to view the scene of destruction; but how was hei gentle heart shocked at the scene which presented itself many a family, who a few houis since had had the fiiendly roof to shelter them, were now wandering about in a state of agony ; many who, through the bounty of Eleanor, had gained
a comfortable subsistence, were now re¬ duced to want, and without the means of procuring the comforts necessary to their existence. The benevolent Eleanor dis- tributed the contents of her purse amongst them, and farther promised to implore the liberality of lady Glendinning for their relief To her great satisfaction* she found her school-house had escaped the fire, and sustained no injury whatever. Eleanor also had another object of solicitude; the unknown female whom lord Montalban had saved caused her much anxiety; from what motive we will not define, but cer¬ tain it was, she inquired at the cottage, and at eveiy other place concerning her, but could gain no farther intelligence than that which lord Montalban had brought; and, with a heavy heaTt -and disappointed hopes, she returned to the castle. Lord Montalban had left it, and in ig¬ norance of her destination, he had re¬ turned to his own residence. Eleanor immediately addressed lady Glendinning in behalf of the poor 'sufferers, and im-
plored her compassion* and likewise that of Georgina. Lady Glendinning, though still keeping up a resentment against her, instantly drew her purse, and presented Eleanor with a small sum for their relief; and Georgina, in a very ungracious manner, gave a trifling donation, while Robert, with native, generosity, added -3. larger sum. Delighted with this success, Eleanor determined to return to the village, which benevolent purpose she accomplished, and soon had the satisfaction of bestowing re¬ lief on the poor unfortunate outcasts, who had thus been deprived of house and home. Still, however, she^found the sum inadequate to supply all their wants, and she promised them to tiy farther for their permanent relief. Whether it was the great anxiety that she took for the -suf¬ ferers, or whether it was owing to. the fa¬ tigue of her exertions, we will not say, but on making her appearance at- the din-
ner-table, she appeared so extremely fa¬ tigued and agitated, that it was observable to every one;, ?nd it seemed as if her emotion' was caught from lord-Arthur, who was in a state bordering, on distrac¬ tion. On the servanu being withdrawn, Eleanor again ventured to prefer her pe¬ tition for more assistance. Gedrgina rather sneeringly remarked, that she was indeed very indefatigable in her exertions, but that she thought enough had already been done. Eleanor forbore to reply, but turned to lady Glendinning, and cast a supplicating look on her. " I do not wish to prevent or discou¬ rage your charitable intentions," replied her ladyship, ■* but you may save your¬ self the trouble of applying to me any farther, as I have cdrcady bestowed all I think proper, and desire pot to be impor¬ tuned'any farther on the subject." Eleanor, though greatly disappointed, curtsied in silence, while lord Arthur,
starting from his chair, gazed sternly at his lady, and in an angry tone exclaimed —",1s your heart callous to the calls of charity? can you withstand the pleadings of this lovely snpplicator, who, though your inferior in years, sets you a pattern worthy the imitation of a prince? But, madam, withhold your paltry dross; ex¬ pend thousands in vain amusements; lavish extravagant sums for your own gratification, feast the rich, and withhold the saving hand from the poor and wretch¬ ed ; and amidst the gaieties into which you will no doubt soon plunge, lay your hand to your heart, and search for the self-ap¬ plauding conviction of having rescued a fellow-creature from misery. In vain will you seek for such an exquisite sensation as this; in vain will you find that unex¬ ampled, that sweet delight of charity." Lady Glendinning patiently bore his invective.—" It is well, my lord," she re¬ plied ; " since you so well know how to describe the self-approving dictates of con- VOL. II. E
scious rectitude, I hope you will endeavour to act so as to deserve them; while I only affirm, that my heart is at this moment perfectly calm, and yet I positively de¬ c-hire, I shall contribute no farther than I have already done." " It is well," returned lord Arthur. " Your ladyship shall no longer be impor¬ tuned on the subject of charity, which so ill accords with your disposition." " Have a care, my lord," interrupted lady Glendinning; " the time may come, when you will own you have wronged me by this severity; but I am content," she added, " Your lordship certainly must judge me in what light you think proper.". A tear dimmed the lustre of her eye, which she instantly endeavoured to con¬ ceal, by passing her hand across lier face; while lord Arthur, highly displeased with her, took the hand of Eleanor, and ex¬ claimed—" Come, my Eleanor, we will together repair to the village, and I will
see that every thing that is necessary shall be clone for the sufferers." Though greatly vexed, Eleanor was obliged to comply; yet she feared the in¬ dignation of lady Glendinning, as she had been, though innocently, the cause of this dissension. It was likewise so unusual a thing for lord Arthur to leave the castle, that she feared the remarks that would be made on it. Lord Arthur appeared buried in thought, and passing the arm of Eleanor within his own, they proceeded to the village, with¬ out scarcely speaking; but on arriving at the eventful spot, both involuntarily stop¬ ped before the remains of the house from which the unknown female had been res¬ cued. The window at which she had been seen yet remained standing, and lord Arthur cast a look of agony to¬ wards it. He felt the arm of Eleanor tremble. He cast a glance of inquiry on her, and beheld a deathly paleness on her countenance. E 2
The tears stole from her eyes as she ex¬ claimed—" What a dreadful scene!" " It is indeed, my Eleanor," he replied; " yet had you seen it when I did, sur¬ rounded by all its horrors, you would have been affected. Had you witnessed the distress of that lovely female, as she stood at yon burning window, your gentle heart would have shrunk with horror; for oh, it even shook my fortitude!" His voice faltered as^ he spoke. He paused, and looked mournfully on Elea¬ nor. Both were agitated to the highest de¬ gree, and they each appeared desirous of concealing their feelings.—" I do not won¬ der, my lord," replied Eleanor, " at the effect it took on you. Her appearance in such a way must have been agonizing to the extreme. Alas! what a fate is hers! Ah, where can she have withdrawn her¬ self? Would I could see her!" " Oh, would you could!" returned lord Arthur; " would we could both at this
instant behold her! At such a moment as this, I would------" He made a deep pause, as if wishing to leave the sentence unfinished; while Eleanor, with a voice of strong emotion, exclaimed—" You would what, my lord ?" " Stretch out a hand to protect her," he replied. " She is evidently drooping be¬ neath the weight of affliction; and I would of course glory in rescuing her, if possible, from further misery. Yes," he added, with much warmth, and sudden anima¬ tion, " if she can be found, I will protect her. We will together, Eleanor, search every cottage to find her; and, if possible, you shall behold her." With trembling steps Eleanor proceeded along. Hope danced in her eyes as they made fresh inquiries; but all were fruit¬ less ; nor could any intelligence be gained concerning the unknown stranger, no far¬ ther than had been repeated by lord Mont¬ alban. The spirits of lord Arthur evidently sunk at this fresh disappointment, and he
expressed his wish to return home.— " Yet," he cried, " let us not be unmind¬ ful of the other sufferers, for whose sake we have interested ourselves. Here is a purse," he added. " Do you, Eleanor, dispose of its contents, as best suits your own ideas of benevolence." Eleanor took his liberal donation.— " Will not your lordship bestow it your¬ self," she cried, " and receive the grati¬ tude of these poor creatures, whose hearts will beat with joy at the sight of their noble benefactor ?" " No, Eleanor," he replied, " my mind is not at present attuned to their honest effusions; nor do I merit their praise; it is what I would wish to avoid. I will therefore walk slowly on towards the castle, when, after bestowing your bounty, you can overtake me." Eleanor curtsied, and left him, in order to obey his wishes. She knew it was in vain to draw him into society, particularly in the present instance, where his presence would have excited general acclamations
of applause, in the event of his bounty. From this she knew his noble soul would shrink, and as she left him, she cast a sigh of regret on his care-worn countenance. She viewed him as a true picture of hu¬ man mortality, formed by nature, noble, generous, and sincere; but having, by one fatal act, departed from the steps of the last quality, he had degenerated into the gloomy and restless misanthrope, discon¬ tented with himself, and all the world; a stranger to repose or peace, and in tor¬ menting himself with painful retrospec¬ tion, was foregoing all the present bless¬ ings which surrounded him. —" Alasl" sighed Eleanor, " unfortunate, yet culp¬ able as thou art, who shall speak peace to thy troubled mind ? what event can restore thy lost happiness ? Ah! would I dare whisper comfort to thy ear! but that sweet delight is forbidden me, else thou shouldst know there is one who pities thy mental sufferings; and though I abhor thy errors, yet should a whole world combine against thee, Eleanor must not.
She would supplicate the Almighty Dis¬ poser of all events to pardon thy crime, and pour the balm of peace into thy sor¬ rowing heart." Eleanor wiped away the tears which flowed down her cheeks at this mental ejaculation/and entered a cottage where most of the sufferers were assembled, and anxious to dispense her assistance, she hastily presented them with the purse of lord Arthur, desiring them to share its contents according to their wants. It was received by all with the utmost demonstrations of joy, and professions of gratitude. " Sure," cried a venerable old man, who had been a sufferer in the highest degree, " the hand of Heaven has been stretched for our relief. Let no one say Charity no longer exists, for she has dispensed her blessings on our heads with the utmost liberality. Noble lord Arthur," he con¬ tinued, " we have the pleasure of being able to bless thy name, whilp our other benefactress we can only thank in idea,
and invoke blessings on our unknown preserver." -. "To whom do you allude?" inquired Eleanor. The old man replied—" That since she had last visited them, a lady, closely at¬ tired, and deeply veiled, had entered their dwelling; that she inquirecl much respect¬ ing the strange lady whom lord Montal¬ ban rescued, and appeared very anxious concerning her; but no one being able to answer her inquiries, she questioned the rest as to their losses, and with the great¬ est benevolence she distributed the sum of one hundred pounds for their relief. It was in vain," he continued, " that we becked to know to whom we were so highly indebted. She insisted upon our remaining in ignorance; and on our ex¬ pressing our thanks for her unbounded' generosity, she withdrew, and shrunk from our praises with such expressions of humbleness, that it appeared as if she were the person obliged, instead of ,the exalted benefactor."' e 3
" And have you no idea who she is?" cried Eleanor, much surprised at this ac¬ count. " No, madam," replied the sire; " my daughter here says she caught a glance of her features once, by her veil blowing aside, and thinks she should know her again, as she was a lady of great beauty and affability of manners; but whoever she is, she possesses a heart formed of the noblest materials, and Heaven will reward her for her generous actions." The old man now besought Eleanor to express their gratitude to lord Arthur for his kindness, and likewise poured forth their thanks to her for her own benevo¬ lence. She also heard them speak with admi¬ ration on another name, in which her heart took the greatest interest — they were loud in their applause of lord Mont¬ alban. Eleanor heard them in silence. She could not speak. What passion actuated her hosom t that while all. tongues were
loud in his applause, she remained alone silent; whilst others described his heroic bravery, she was mute, not because she felt it not; on the contrary, she found the praises sink deep into her heart. She could not express her approbation in mere words. It was true her lips remained unclosed, but had an observer read the language of her eyes, they would have beheld the rapture which beamed in them. So true it is,, that the passion of love is more eloquent in silence than in all the* mere flimsy expressions of speech. Eleanor had paused to hear his praises, but recollecting lord Arthur was waiting for her, she hastily left the cottage, and soon joined him, as he was impatiently expecting her. Eleanor began by informing him of the benevolent stranger, who had so liber¬ ally assisted the cottagers. Lord Arthur listened attentively to her- narrative.—" Such a woman as that," he exclaimed,, " is worthy the admiration of all. Oh, how different to lady Gtendin-
ning I Why was it my lot to marry an object so the reverse ? I ever knew her to be proud, and of an aspiring spirit; but till this day I had flattered myself she possessed humanity of heart; but her cold "and decided refusal to you convinced me she is not blest with one softer feeling of charity and compassion." . Eleanor endeavoured to excuse her lady¬ ship, by alledging that, on her first ap¬ plication, she had immediately bestowed a donation, antl probably did not choose to give more; and then trying to turn the subject, she continued—" I wish, my lord, I could have prevailed on you to have personally received their honest effusions. Your heart would have experienced the greatest satisfaction in witnessing tlieir joy, occasioned by your own hand; but through my humble tongue your lordship must receive their thanks." " None arc due to me, Eleanor," inter¬ rupted lord Arthur. " I have only given them a little paltry dross, of which I was not in want myself. What merit lies in
that? and why should I listen to praises which I deserve not ? You well know I hate the flimsy effusions of the babbling multitude, which comprise the world, from which I have withdrawn myself, nor ever wish again to enter it. And would you have me now force myself into the pre¬ sence of these poor people, merely to com¬ pel them to annoy me with thanks, wliich are neither my due, nor do I wish to hear them? 'No, Eleanor, I deserve not the applause of man, for I have lost my own approbation; and what avails the mere flattery directed to me by a misjudging race, who, because they benefit by that which I want not, would convert me into a god, and offend my ear by their ill-timed expressions ? No, Eleanor, never will I listen to sounds like these. Tell me of that being who will stand forth, and open¬ ly upbraid me with my many crimes, and I will listen with an attentive ear; and in weeping over my guilt, wash away the remembrance of my past life." " Forbear, my lord," cried. Eleanor,
greatly shocked at his evident agitation, " forbear such a strain as this, which suit's not with the mind and disposition of lord Arthur, who, resigning himself to the gloomy ideas of a tortured fancy, throws away the blessings by which he is sur¬ rounded. Forgive me, my lord," she con¬ tinued, " speaking in such a strain as this; but when I see you resigning yourself to an unavailing grief, it is but my duty to rouse you from it, and at least endeavour to point out tho roses as well as thorns that attend your steps." " That is a task beyond thy powers," he replied. " No, Eleanor, not one rose is strewed in my path. My fate is dark; and weary am I of this pilgrimage, this earthly career." " Talk not so/ cried Eleanor; " you have many happier years in store, I trust, yet. Believe me, I am not insensible to your sorrows. Would they could be ame¬ liorated ! but, my lord, that Power who can wound will also heal, when He sees fit. It is not for me to point out the,*
blessings of religion, which alone can sup¬ port us in the hour of trial. Look with hope to those realms above; repose in safety on the mercy of him who receives the penitence of his creatures; and be as¬ sured, my lord, you will experience the blessing of a self-approving conscience." " Alas, Eleanor!" he replied, " could I but once regain that, all might be well. There was a time, when posssessed of a heart light and at ease, I was the gayest of human beings; but my hopes were early blighted. To please a father, I sacri¬ ficed my happiness. I married a woman opposite to my taste; and our union, as you well know, Eleanor, has proved a source of misery." \" And yet, my lord," replied Eleanor, " lady Glendinning- possesses many noble*, nay, amiable qualities; and ungrateful 1 must I be, the child of her bounty, if X- did not acknowledge her kindness and benevolence, in sheltering a poor orphan like myself, when forced upon her bounty by my unfortunate mother."
"Unfortunate mother!" re-echoed lord Arthur. " Oh, well may you say so! she is indeed most unfortunate." " I sincerely believe so, my lord," re¬ plied Eleanor, fixing her eyes on him; " and it has often excited my wonder, that my father should have never stepped forth and acknowledged his child. My heart pants to receive a father's blessing, and to be clasped in a paternal embrace." Lord Arthur caught her hand.—" Hold," he cried, "or you will unman-me! In me, Eleanor, behold one who will prove a father to you; and be assured I feel as such for you; and I am convinced the time will, nay, it must arrive, when* your father will proudly acknowledge his child. Oh, Eleanor," he added, " forbear a reply. You know not the emotions you excite in this harassed bosom—the agony I en¬ dure is torture to. the extreme. I know you think my conduct strange and incom¬ prehensible, but my tongue must not ex¬ plain. It is, alas! the poor prerogative of greatness to sigh in silence, and unpitied."
He pressed her hand fervently, as they had now reached the castle, and entering in, he hastily rushed towards his own room, while Eleanor mentally uttered a prayer to that Power who alone could calm his distracted mind.
CHAPTER V.
" Her beauteous formj that first to love his heart iiiclin'd, Still wanders in his warm, his ardent mind; He saw her as the new-blown blossoms fair, Sprightly ns light, more soft than summer's air. Bright as their beams, her eyes a mind disclose, Whilst on her lips gay blush'd the fragrant rose; Wit, youth, and love, in each dear feature shone: - Prest on by fate, he gaz'd, and was undone." On entering the drawing-room, Eleanor beheld lord Montalban, who immediately arose to meet her, and taking her hand, inquired, with the greatest solicitude, if she had recovered from the effects of her indisposition ? A pensive smile stole over her lovely features, as she assured him of her conva¬ lescence. Her pallid cheek and agitated counten¬ ance contradicted her assertion. Pier voice trembled with emotion as she ad-
dressed him, whilst his lordship continued to gaze on her with looks of rapture. From her behaviour to him in the morn¬ ing he augured the most pleasing auspices, and he resolved, in spite of every difficul¬ ty, to gain her for his own; and for this purpose he determined to seek some op¬ portunity of revealing his sentiments to lier in private, when, if he could gain an acknowledgment in his favour from her own lips, he would further implore her to wait until some more favourable oppor¬ tunity should offer of openly avowing his love for her to his family. Lady Glendinning and her daughter both remained at home that evening. Lady Lenox also added her company, and with her usual malignity watched the actions of lord JMontalban. She saw his whole attention was directed towards Eleanor, and she whispered to lady Glen¬ dinning, that the London scheme must instantly be put into execution, or serious consequences would arise. Lady Glendinning, who wished much
to visit London once more, independent of Eleanor, assented; and lady Lenox re¬ solved that their journey should take place as quick as possible. Eleanor observed the scrutiny of lady Lenox, and taking the first moment in her power, she again withdrew. Lord Montalban involuntarily arose on her departure, and stationed himself at the window, and in a few minutes he be¬ held the object of his solicitude crossing the lawn. A sigh escaped his lips as she disappeared from his sight. He would have given worlds, had he possessed them, to have been able to follow her steps, antl to breathe in her ear the soft wishes of his soul, but he dared not quit the com¬ pany of the ladies in which he now was; and with a heavy heart he endeavoured to enter into conversation. Georgina seated herself at the piano, and lord Montalban, ever a lover of mu¬ sic, joined in a soft strain, in order to be¬ guile the passing hour, until tho return of Eleanor,
Lord Aithur had shut himself in his own room, and had given orders not. to be disturbed, as he was indisposed; and all knew his habitual gloom too well to dis¬ obey his commands. Lady Lenox threw out some bitter al¬ lusions respecting him, which lady Glen¬ dinning heard in silence. As the time began to draw on with leaden wings, at least to lord Montalban, he drew out his watch, and impatiently named the hour, till at length Eleanor made her appearance; but how much was he distressed at the symptoms of grief and sorrow visible in her countenance ! De¬ jection sat upon her face; and with a fal¬ tering voice she begged permission to re¬ tire for the night, as she found herself very indisposed. Lady Glendinning bowed her assent; and Eleanor curtseying to all, left the room for the night. " Miss Glendinning appears very ill," exclaimed lord Montalban, in a voice of
the utmost solicitude. " Had she not better have advice?" " Oh, to be sure," replied lady Lenox, in a spiteful tone. " The whole college of physicians had better be summoned to her aid. But I am fearful all their skill combined will not cure her of her ridicu¬ lous whims and airs, which she is for ever giving herself" " Eleanor certainly looks very ill." said lady Glendinning, without noticing her mother's illiberal speech; " and her coun- tenance betrays a mind ill at ease, or I am much mistaken; but whatever may be the cause, as she does not choose to reveal, I shall not seek to know. Her conduct has certainly of late appeared very mys¬ terious." " Say, rather, very reprehensible," in¬ terrupted lady Lenox; " and any one* but you would insist on an explanation from herself." " No," replied lady Glendinning, " I will not be the cause of her again telling
a falsehood; and it is evident she does not wish I should know the truth." During this short conversation lord Montalban was distracted; to hear her thus spoken of, without being allowed the poor privilege of defending her, was agony to the extreme; and it was also an additional torture to his soul, in the conviction that the conduct of Eleanor was mysterious, and until he could in some measure have it explained, he remained miserable. As early as possible he withdrew from the castle, leaving lady Lenox to make her comments on his conduct, which she did in so violent a strain, that lady Glen¬ dinning almost became a convert to her opinion, and agreed as to the propriety of removing Eleanor from the presence of lord Montalban. Lady Lenox soon after ordered her carriage and returned home, and on her pillow she reflected on the most advisable plan to adopt, in order to remove Eleanor to London, without its seeming a preme¬ ditated plot to lord Arthur, who, she was
well aware, would use his authority to -\prevent it. To lady Cecilia Gray she was resolved to apply for assistance, as she well knew she was a woman who, to promote her own designs, would make use of any steps which her vindictive imagination couid invent. Early the next morning, therefore, she repaired to B------ House, and quickly communicated the cause of her visit to lady Cecilia, who, with a smile of appro¬ bation, replied—" That fortune favoured their designs, as she had received letters from her agent in London, requesting her immediate presence, to settle her affairs; and it would appeavbut as a natural event to make a party to accompany her to that place of gaiety." And she proposed to pay a vkit to lady Glendinning, on pur¬ pose to invite her openly to accompany her, with her family. " It was true," she added, " that lord Montalban must also be of the party; but that they must put up with his being in the society of Elea¬ nor during their journey, as, on their ar-
riving jn London, it was determined <she should be fixed with Mrs. Conway." Lady Lenox was quite overjoyed at this plan, and in a short time accompani¬ ed lady, Cecilia to St. f Michael's,, and, made .known her intentions to lady Glen¬ dinning, who immediately expressed, her determination to accompany her,-with her family, to London; and it was agreed that, in a week from that day, they should commence their journey. • Lady Lenox was now quite elated with the idea of removing the innocent object of her hatred from the sight of lord Mont¬ alban, and her grandson Robert, of whom she likewise entertained the greatest fears, respecting his partiality for her. She knew not the heroic resolutions he had formed, and to which lie was strictly ad¬ hering ; and though it had cost him a severe struggle, he had partly conquered his un¬ fortunate attachment for Eleanor, whom he now regarded as a dear sister; and it was with much concern he beheld her VOL. II. l«*
visible dejection, which he placed to the account of her love for lord Montalban. Lord Arthur had kept a close prisoner to his own room, during the time since his visit to the village with Eleanor; nor did he quit it until the hour of dinner. When he made his appearance at the table, lady Glendinning immediately in¬ quired as to his health, as his look indicat¬ ed extreme debility. He replied, that he was very ill, and scarcely able to do the honours of his table, btit that he had exerted himself for that "purpose. Her ladyship replied, she was particu¬ larly obliged, as she much wished to see Mm, to acquaint him with her intention Of accompanying lady Cecilia Gray to London. Lord Arthur replied, that she was cer¬ tainly at liberty to make what arrange¬ ments she thought proper, and inquired wheti she meant to commence her jour- *iey? She informed him of their hasty de-
parture, adding-r^ I know, my lord, it would be a mere compliment to invite you to accompany us, as X suppose your health would not permit it." " Neither my health nor spirits would allow of it," replied lord Arthur. " I liave no inclination to quit the solitude of $t- Michael's; but as I cannot expect ypu tp confine yourself, I shall make no .opposjr tion to your leaving it." " Your lordship is very obliging," cried lady Glendinning, " and I certainly shall avail myself of your kindness." She then turned to Eleanor, and desired that she would prepare herself for the journey. Eleanor turned pale at this command, as in a tremulous voice she inquired, if she was to accompany her ladyship ? " Certainly," replied lady .Glen&nniag. " I have always as yet given you the same advantages as my own children; and in this instance I shall not deprive you of the benefit of a trip to London, where you E-2
will witness the ease and elegance of tha scene of fashion and splendour." " But perhaps Eleanor may have nc inclination to visit that gay resort," criec 1 lord Arthur; " and I should think it mosl advisable for lier to remain on her native shore; and indeed it is my wish that sht should stay with me, if it would not prove irksome to her." " Oh no, my lord," quickly returned Eleanor. " On the contrary, I should prefer it, if lady Glendinning would ex¬ cuse my attendance. I ha ye indeed no inclination for scenes of gaiety." ^ The colour of lady Glendinning mount¬ ed in her face, as lord Arthur expressed his wishes respecting Eleanor. He had readi¬ ly agreed for her to quit Scotland, but Eleanor he was anxious should remain with him. Her-- proud spirit again arose at this pointed preference, and in a haugh¬ ty tone she replied — " However your lordship - may influence the actions' oi Eleanor, I shall, in this instance, remain decided. If I am capable of protecting
my own daughter, whom your lord¬ ship makes no objection to my taking, I can also receive the charge of Eleanor; and I positively assert, I shall not quit the castle without her. It is therefore my command, Eleanor, that you prepare to attend me, as I shall admit of no ex¬ cuse whatever." Eleanor replied, that she would certain¬ ly obey her; but it was evident that the command gave her the most serious con¬ cern. Lord Arthur remained silent on the subject. He had his own private reasons for wishing the departure of lady Glen¬ dinning for a time, and that of the prying lady Lenox, whom he had ever cordially disliked, and he therefore did not wish to oppose lady Glendinning in her plan; but on her first mentioning it, he had no idea that she would have taken Eleanor with her, and he had anticipated the de¬ light he should feel in her society; and he still resolved, if possible, to keep her with
him, though lie thought it most prudent not to pursue the subject farther at pre- teftt Lady Glendinning, highly offended with him, left the table as early as pos¬ sible ; and lord Arthur, after taking a few glasses of wine with his son, retired to his own room. Earl Campbell had of late been nearly confined to his chamber; old age and in¬ firmities were fast wearing him away, added to which his mind was ill at ease. Conscience, that never-failing torment to a tortured breast, whispered in his ear, that he had heen the instrumental cause of both his children's misery. Lady Fran-' ces, by his severity, was lost to her family, and Heaven only knew 1 her fate; while in his son, lord Arthur, he daily beheld the visible effects of his having sacrificed his happiness to his commands, in uniting himself to lady Glendinning; and he shud¬ dered as he recollected the words of lord Arthur, previous to his union, wherein he
asserted, " that of whatever misery his union was productive, the earl alone was the cause." t This reflection haunted his imagination, and he would have given all liis wealth to have recalled the hour when he sacrificed both his children to ambition; and in solir tude he passed the hours in agonizing re¬ flections. Lady Glendinning still fte^y to, scenes of gaiety, leaving the two noble masters of St. Michael's buried in their pwn gloo¬ my, ideas; and while her own, heart car¬ ried a rankling thorn^, she forced the smile of gaiety into her countenance, and under the mask of pride, she concealed her real feelings from the misjudging muj> titude. - ,- iu. . , On retiring on this day from the dinnerr table, she ordered her, carriage, and, with Georgina,' repaired to fulfil, an engager ment, and leaving word they should mt be home until a. late-hour, left the..castle. < Some time after their departure, ISJeanpr,
who had been sitting alone, descended to the drawing-room, and' pensively seating herself at the window, reflected *on the commands of lady Glendinning to attend her" to London. Never had any com¬ mands proved so unwelcome as 1 these; for there ivere reasons which at this present time rendered ! the ! task agonizing to Elea¬ nor ; yet she saw no way to avoid it; and the tears flowed fast froni her eyes at 'the idea. ( v She had sat some little time, when she beheld lord Montalban coming towards the castle. Her heart beat, and she scarce¬ ly knew how to receive him, as she had endeavoured to avoid being alone' with him; yet it would now appear so pointed to leave the room, that she thought it best to stay. k ! f On arriving at the castle.' lord Montal¬ ban was informed both lady Glendinning and her daughter were absent; but who can conceive his joy, on -inquiring * for Eleanor, to find she was at hoin6 and
alone! ^Vyith the wings of love he al¬ most flew to the drawing-room, where she sat, and taking her hand, he inquired, with a voice of ineffable tenderness, if she had recovered her late indisposition ? She trembled as she replied in the affir¬ mative; but her pallid cheek caught the attention of lord Montalban; he saw the tears which, like the dewy star of even¬ ing, still shone in her eye. This was an opportunity not to be lost —a moment for which he had so long sighed; and he resolved to know his fate — -<? You assert, your recovery," he cried, " and-yet your countenance indicates far otherwise. Oh, why are those precious tears still trembling in your eyes? and why does that lovely face carry such evi¬ dent marks of dejection, so different to when I iu;st beheld you, on that never to- be-forgotten ; night? Oh, Eleanor, reveal the cruel cause to him who would sacri¬ fice all to procure you happiness!" . "My lord," cried Eleanor, "you mis- V B
take. The effects of tny late indisposition have not worn off. No 'Other cause exists that I aan reveal." " %>h, Eleanor," replied his lordship, " would I could induce you to place full confidence in me! Your happiness *s in¬ deed dear to tny hea-rt; it is connected with m) own; nor can I ever know peace until I obtain ah acknowledgment from you that I am not indifferent to you. Oh, my Eleanor, (permit me to cah* you so) you cannot be in ignorance of my sentiments towards yourself, and must pity the unfortunate situation into wliich, by'the folly of my relations, I am plunged; but though 'circumstances impel me 1 to carry on a trifling deception, 1 positively declare I never will sacrifice myself to their wishes. My heart, {Eleanor, is yours. Then give tne some hopes that *my F, pttS- skrfi is reciprocal, and I will 'yet hrave-alt to gain my EleanOr." Is ( " Hold, my lord," -she t-eplied. " This is a language to which ^1 'must -not listen. Your engagement to Georgina ought to
be a sufficient reason to impose a silence on ^our lips, however your inclinations may turn to the contrary; nor can I hold myself as just in listening a momenjb to such U strain. You are j-ecejved Jn this house as the acknowledged lover of }i& heiress, and such I must consider you." ( "Cruel girl!" cried lord Montalban, "can you talk fcjms coldly ? Alas! J had flattered .myself that my idea was not in¬ different to you. The interest which I .imagined you jtook in my late yesterday .morning, gave me the liveliest pleasure; but your present behaviour { plunges ,me into misery, as I fear I love without frppe. Oh, Eleanor! you cannot be inse^s^le to the sentiments which I have -enter,t#in- edfcr you since our first meejbing; #nd, forgive my presumption .when J say, I cherished them under the ide# ,pjf tlieir being congepial to your own; nor would I relinquish tl?em for worlds, as they,alone support me under,my present misfortune,. Oh, Eleanor! beloved Eleanor!;ca^i you h$ar ,tp see me the victim to a .hopeless
passion, when, by one sweet' smile, you could make me happy." j ' He paused, and gazed earnestly in her face.' 'What a moment was this for Eleanor! She feltunable to assume coldness foreign to her'heart; yet, under all circumstances, she could not encourage his addresses— *' c "My ford," she replied, in a voice of ex¬ treme agitation,'" I am not insensible to your Writs,' nor ungrateful for your good opinion; aiid were I situated otherwise, I will be 1 candid in saying, I would, with pleasure, 1 'constitute your'lordship's happi¬ ness . but 1 as it is, you will see the pro¬ priety bf waving this subject, which can only tetid to make us both unhappy; and 1 sinceiely hope your lordship will find every felicity in the marriage state"- '• "* "'Never,'' interrupted lord Montalban; "never, my Eleanor, unless you-are-the lovely being who will constitute it. ( You have'revived all my hopes, and hear my firm declaration^ that I never will' unite mysfelf to Georgina. Only give me one
sweet acknowledgment, and; I 'will wait patiently for that time when I can openly avow my love for my Eleanor^ who .will hot then refuse my vows." :/; r ;; He pressed her hand fervently. Adeep blush suffused itself over her face. ? ■ ^The truth /spread itself in sweet confusion in her lovely countenance; and lord Mont¬ alban passionately pressed his cause, with such irresistible ardour, that Eleanor could scarcely? assume a reserve. A reciprocal acknowledgment trembled on Her lips; but; virgin modesty forbad the sentence, andf it died away in soft confusion. LordHMontalban 'was enraptured;^ he read the language of her heart in her eyes, and he proceeded to; say, that ^ he. would, with her permission,: speak to lord Arthur on the subject, who, he flattered himself, would* not withhold his* consent, and 'that, if only assured of her love, he would rest eonterited ; until some favourable ^oppor¬ tunity' should; occur to make his swishes known to his family." ;.-fnm^w.\ ^ f That you hvould have lord Arthur's
..ELEANOR. sanction," replied Eleanor, " I am certain. He appreciates your many noble qualities; hut, my lord, though you have partly drawn from me a confession which I .would for ever conceal, I cannot consent to such steps being taken. There are many reasons to forbid it, and I tmuet de¬ cline all such proceedings; and if you re¬ gard both my happiness and yoiu' own, bury this unhappy passion for sever in oblivion. There are many reasons why I can oiever become yours." " You distress me beyond measure," cried lord Montalban, " by this avowal. What -are Iho'.e cruel reasons ? Surely, if I remove theobstacle on my part, no other cause «an exist. Oh, say 1 have not a il •val an your affections '" Lord 'MontaUlban looked anxiously in her face. iHe remembered ithe accusation wMch had been made against her, respect ing her meeting with some favoured.-loMer, and he waited between -hope and fear for her answer. i > ■ Before she could make him a reply, the
door opened, and a servant entered the room, and bowing to Eleanor, presented her with a letter, which he said had just been brought, and no answer required. Eleanor seized the ietter with avidity, and casting her eyes on the superscription, involuntarily pressed it to her lips, while lord Montalban stood motionless ' with surprise—jealousy seized his soul, as,«re¬ gardless of his presence, she broke 1 the seal, and perused its contents. Joy -evidently danced in her eyes, as, raising her clasped hands to heaven, she appeared ito, utter a mental ejaculation; and then hastily closing her letter, she placed it in her bosom, and casting a look of confusion on lord Mont¬ alban, appeared, for the first time, to be sensible of his presence. i '' " f

ing anxiously at her, exclaimed—" Were I not to notice the visible agitation excited in you by the receipt of this letter, it would appear as if the professions I have just been making were * insincere. You must be aware, Eleanor, of the tender interest I take in your welfare, and what my feelings must at this moment be, lest that epistle, so wekomely received, should have been written by a rival. You will therefore, I am sure, both excuse and re¬ lieve my fears, by informing me what correspondent it is, whose writing is so evidently dear to your heart. Oh, Elea¬ nor ! instantly remove my torturing sus¬ picions, and say from whom that letter comes." " Impossible, my lord," replied Eleanor, in a faltering tone; " I cannot comply with your lordship's request," " Cannot I" he re-echoed. " Cannot, Eleanor! / Rather say you will not! Cruel fate is mine, thus to have the cup of hap¬ piness ' for ever dashed from my lips; a few minutes since, and I flattered myself
that I' had gained an interest in your bo¬ som, and that you would have sweetly confirmed my happiness, by consenting to have become mine; but now those pleasing prospects vanish. I see the rea¬ sons which you asserted prevented your uniting yourself to me. My worst fears are confirmed-1 see I have a favoured rival." " My lord," interrupted Eleanor, " you wrong me. However appearances are against me, I am innocent of your charge." •" Then reveal this mystery," cried lord Montalban. " Can you say that your feelings are not warmly excited for this secret correspondent ? Your conduct be¬ trayed not only solicitude, but the ten- derest affection. Can you say otherwise ?" " No, my lord," replied Eleanor, " I will not deny that sacred truth; and how¬ ever I may be the sufferer in your lord¬ ship's good opinion, I own there is not that being in existence for whose welfare I am so tenderly anxious, but whose name
cannot escape these lips. I know, my lord, your feelings, and am sorry for them; believe me, I would not willingly be guilty of cruelty to your lordship, and though I value your friendship, your es¬ teem, yet 1 feel I must lose them for ever. You will deem m? mysterious, and perhaps criminal; but it ij my fate, and I must obey its imperious commands, which now oblige me instantly to leave you." " To leave me!" he cried. " Oh, Elea¬ nor, what has this avowal not cost me! And would you then leave me in a state like this ? For pity's sake stay, and give me some explanation!" " My lord, I cannot. Particular reasons call me this instant from the castle." " 'Tis well," exclaimed lord Montalb?.^, turning angrily from her. " Go then, and meet this happy favoured rival, and for¬ get in his embraces the wretched Mont¬ alban, whom your cruelty has rendered for ever miserable. Yes," he continued, in a hasty tone, " my hopes are for ever
blighted. My friends may now dispose of me as they please^ for to every thing I am now indifferent—fbfby Eleanor I am rejected." - i - The agitation of Eleano. was so exces¬ sive, that she leaned for a moment against the door for support.—" My lord," she cried, " you wrong me. Heaven knows Lwould willingly relieve you, but------" She paused. He approached her, and took her trembling hand—" Oh, what a task is mine!" she continued. " The strug¬ gle is great, but duty gains the victory. Faiewell, my lord!" saying which she hastily broke from him, and rushed from the room. Lord Montalban sunk on a chair, in a state of absolute dejection, and remained for some time without the power of mov¬ ing, when suddenly recollecting himself, he started up, in order to return home, as if any of the family entered the room, he should not be in spirits to converse. On going towards the door, he beheld
lying on the carpet the very letter which had thus distressed him, evidently dropped by Eleanor in her agitation and haste to leave him. With an involuntary eager¬ ness he picked up the fatal paper, and half unclosed it. He paused. Reflection represented to him, was he at liberty to do so, would it be right to possess himself of the know¬ ledge of that which Eleanor had so scrupu¬ lously concealed from him ? Yet he con¬ sidered it was not an idle curiosity promp¬ ted him to read it—it was a motive found¬ ed upon his future happiness or misery, and he resolved, let what would be the consequences, to peruse it; he therefore hastily opened it, and with indescribable emotion read as follows:—
" Oh, my Eleanor! my beloved girl! what have 1 not suffered since our last meeting! I know your affectionate heart will ache at the fatal cause of my affliction. Ah! little did I suppose, wheu
we parted, such a dreadful occurrence would intervene to prevent our usual in¬ terview. Think, my dearest Eleanor, what must have been my sufferings, at being deprived also of my only earthly happiness, that of seeing you and folding you to my tortured heart; but I could not find means to convey any intelligence to you until the present moment, in con¬ sequence of the secrecy which must be observed in our communications. I fear lest the late occurrence should have proved too much for your tender bosom; but hear up, my beloved girl, for my sake, and be cautious you do not betray me to lord Arthur. I have much to unfold to you; but my senses are quite disoraored __I cannot write. Meet me then at the usual spot this evening, and at the usual hour, and I will then pour out all my sorrows to the bosom of her who is my only comforter, and whom I know takes the tenderest interest in my fate. Oh, my Eleanor, let. me <onee more dasp you in my ardent embrace, and 1 shall ibe are*
compensed for all my sufferings. Do not fail to meet me. Farewel'! " Your affectionate, " E." The feelings of lord Montalban can be better imagined than described during the perusal of the above letter. He eager¬ ly examined the writing. It was a bold and masterly hand, and his tortured fancy instantly pronounced it to be written by one of his own sex; the language also convinced him it must be so, and tlie con¬ viction drove him almost to agony. Elea¬ nor was then lost to him for ever; for was not this fatal scrawl proof sufficient," strong as holy writ," of the reciprocity of affection which subsisted between her and *this fa¬ voured rival ? She was likewise, beyond doubt, gone to meet him, according to his request; and lord Montalban tortured himself with the idea of her being with another, in whose society she would of course forget him. He had flattered him-
self that he had excited some interest in her heart; but he pictured to himself that she wa^ previously engaged in some secret amour, which prevented her receiving his addresses, which she might otherwise have accepted. Yet the idea of her carrying on such a clandestine correspondence low¬ ered her in his opinion, and he resolved to mike the effort of banishing her from his heart. So absorbed was he in his own reflec¬ tions, that he noticed not the opening of the door, until he beheld the form of Eleanor before him. He started on her unexpected appearance, and gazing on her, he saw her countenance was pale, and exhibited signs of affright. She glanced her eyes on the carpet, and then.on lord Montalban.—"I beg your lordship's pardon," she cried, " but I have lost. ------" She paused, as he cast on her so pene¬ trating a glance that she appeared unable to proceed. " What,can Miss Glendinning have
lost," he replied, " to cause her this emotion? Had you sustained the loss I have, you might have cause for regret; for, alas! my peace of mind is gone for ever." " Pray, my lord, add not to my present distress," she cried. " I have lost a paper which is of the greatest consequence to me, aiid which causes me the utmost con¬ cern." ** Be under no apprehension, madam," returned lord Montalban, " your letter is safe," at the same time presenting it to her, " and happy am I," he continued, " to have it in my power thus to ease your fears; for though my happiness is for ever gone by this dreaded conviction to my doubts, yet your welfare must ever be dear to my heart; and oh, may you be happy with lum who is in possession of your affections!" Eleanor averted her eyes as she took the letter.—" Alas, my lord I" she cried, " that wish, I fear, is vain. I am not VOL. II. &
destined to taste the cup of happiness; but," she continued, endeavouring to as¬ sume a tone of fortitude, " there is an¬ other favour I would ask at your lordship's hands, and which will add to the large debt I already owe you" " What is there I would not do to pro¬ mote the peace of Eleanor?" interrupted lord Montalban, again thrown off his u-uard by her looks of tenderness; "and to what debt can you allude ? I have not as yet had the happiness of serving you." " Oh, yes, you have," quickly returned Eleanor. " You know not how much so; yet, though my heart is bursting with gratitude, still must I be silent." " You surprise me," interrupted lord Montalban. " What means this mysteri¬ ous language? Reveal your conduct, I implore you." " I cannot, my lord; I am a child of mystery. The time may come when you will perhaps think less severely of me than you do at present; and believe me,
you would pity me if you knew my pre¬ sent feelings." " Let me share them then," cried lord Montalban; " only explain the meaning of this fatal letter, and you will relieve me of a weight of woe." " Impossible, my lord," replied Eleanor. " I am convinced your'lordship is master of its contents, and the favour I have to ask at your hands is, that you will never reveal it to any mortal in existence. The result would be dreadful if known; I there¬ fore implore your pity and your secrecy." Lord Montalban was affected at her visible agitation. She looked more irre¬ sistibly beautiful than ever; and his lord¬ ship would have given the wealth of worlds to have pressed her to his heart, and called her his own for ever.—" Grant me then your confidence," he cried; " teach me all I have to know, and I will forego my own hopes to ensure your peace." " Generous Montalban!" involuntarily ejaculated Eleanor, " were I alone con- 62
cerncd, every secret of my soul should be laid open to you; but I dare not—an¬ other's happiness rests on my secrecy—a beloved being, for whose sake I must and will be silent." This avowal again inflamed the jealousy of lord Montalban. His supposed rival again crossed his imagination, as turning from her, he cried—" Make yourself easy, Miss Glendinning; I promise you eternal silence on the transactions of this night." " I thank you, my lord," replied Elea¬ nor, " and now once more take my leave." " Stay," cried lord Montalban; " do not again leave me in this uncertainty; I cannot endure it. Only grant me some explanation of your present conduct, re¬ pose confidence in me, and rest assured I will never betray it." " My lord," she replied, " it grieves me to be thus compelled to refuse a request of yours, but I cannot reveal the cause of my silence. That there is a cause,' it would be useless in me to' attempt to deny. There is, I own, a fatal secret ex-
isting in my bosom, and were I only con¬ cerned in it, I would divulge it ,to you ; but as it is, should I unfortunately appear as criminal in your eyes, yet I positively assert, I cannot, will not reveal it" " Only say then," cried lord JMontalban, again taking her hand, " that you are not going to meet my rival; assure me of this, and I will be satisfied. Convince me you are not now hastening to the writer of this letter, and I will endeavour to bear the rest of my torture till you shall please to repose a willing confidence in mc." He looked anxiously in her face; he beheld the deepest blushes diffuse them¬ selves over her checks, as he pronounced the latter part of his speech. " My lord," she cried, " forbear that question; my soul revolts at falsehood, and the truth I dare not say." " 'Tis well," replied lord Montalban, in a tone of anger. " 'Tis well. Fool that I am, thus to importune you, and to de¬ tain you from your appointment with your lover. Farewell, Miss Glendinning!
may every happiness be yours! I wish you so, though I am for ever wretched; but believe me, I will never more disturb your peace with my complaints; for con- . viction stares me in the face, and I must be mad indeed to persecute you when I so plainly see the state of your affections" He relinquished her hand, and turned from her, while Eleanor, greatly agitated, exclaimed—" My affections are, I fear, indeed unfortunately fixed----- -" She stopped, unable to proceed, and casting on him a look of varying emotion, she curtseyed, and once more left the room. On her departure, lord Montalban walk¬ ed, with agitated steps, to the windovy, and soon beheld hei- going across the lawn. He looked at her with sensations bordering on agony; he felt how much lie loved her, but he resolved to tear her image from his heart. She was unworthy of his regard, for she was engaged in clan¬ destine correspondence with some favoured lover, who was doubtless endeavouring to steal her from her family, and what'was
still worse, sanctioned by herself, as her conduct and the contents of the letter plainly shewed.—" How fortunate," eja¬ culated lord Montalban, "that I should have gained sight of this fatal scrawl, which has at once convinced me of the fallacy of encouraging sentiments of love for this too-fascinating girl! Oh, Eleanor," he continued, " how shall I banish thy lovely image from my bosom ! Yet it must be done. She loves another; and could I wish to obtain a divided heart ? Ah ! no, the object of Montalban's choice must be she whose whole affections are free, until they fix upon him unrestrained, and become wholly his—such must be the woman of my choice. Yet why do I talk thus ? I rave—I have no choice —I act in compuhion —I shall be forced into a marriage at which my soul revolts—I shall wed Georgina, and dote still on Eleanor, whom I feel I cannot hate, though she is cold to me. What then remains but a compliance, on my part, Vrith the wishes of my cruel aunt? by
that means I shall save a father from mill. That thought shall support me in my trying task. Once wedded to Georgina, it will become a duty to forget Eleanor; and in the conviction of fulfilling the path? of rectitude, I shall feel the self-approving dictates of conscience, which will enable me to sustain the cruel task. Yes," he cried, " lady Cecilia shall triumph; her heart shall rejoice; my father shall be saved; and the wretched Frederick shall be the sacrifice, for Eleanor never can be mine. Oh, love, how hard is thy conflict! Assist me, all ye powers of Heaven, and grant me fortitude to support the resolu¬ tion I have made!" Lord Montalban turned from the win¬ dow, and leaving the castle, returned as quickly os possible to his own home. If his lordship possessed a fault, which could be denominated as such, it was that of too' great an impetuosity of temper. He was now convinced, as he imagined, of the falsehood of Eleanor; he had re¬ solved to wed Georgina, and in the warmth
of his feelings he was hurried on to reveal his present determination to lady Cecilia Gray, who, on his arriving at home, im¬ mediately inquired why he was not with Georgina, in not the most gentle tone imaginable. lie replied, that she was out, and in consequence he could not see her. Lady Cecilia now prepared to open a long harangue, as to his neglectful con¬ duct of her, alledging that, on the terms on which he stood in the family, he ought to be continually at her side, and that all parties at which she visited, should like¬ wise extend their invitations to him,— " But," she continued, in a spiteful tone, " I see plain enough how it is. Miss Glendinning is suffered by you to go about unattended, and almost unheeded, while that little artful girl, that Eleanor, engrosses the whole of your thoughts; but he aware how you encourage a hope¬ less passion for her; for hero 1 solemnly declare, in the presence of your father, she- G 3
never shall be yours while I live. You know my will is law, and that my dispo¬ sition is as great as my means, which will accomplish any thing I choose to prevent the disappointment of my hopes " Her eyes flashed with fury as she spoke*. Lord Montalban looked with horror on his vindictive aunt, as he replied—" Your ladyship need not remind me of the prac¬ ticability of all your intentions. Already have we had one mysterious and fatal in¬ stance of the accomplishment of your designs." " Have a care, sir," replied lady Cecilia, " how you revert to past affairs. If you believe in the instance to which you al¬ lude, tremble then at my power, which shall be extended in its fullest force to¬ wards Eleanor, should you dare to think of uniting yourself to her." Though lord Montalban trembled at the principles of his imperious aunt, yet, situated as he now was, he thought it best to reconcile himself to her. He there¬ fore replied, that so far from wishing now
to unite himself to Eleanor, he had the strongest objections to such an union, and that, to convince her of the truth of his assertion, be was ready to wed Georgina as soon as affairs could be ready. On hearing this declaration, the coun¬ tenance of lady Cecilia became composed. The marquis of B------was delighted. He bestowed the warmest praises on his son's obedience; and lady Cecilia now be¬ came all complaisance to her darling ne¬ phew, as, when in good humour, she styled lord Montalban.
CHAPTER VII.
Oil, beware, my Iortl r of jealousy J It is a grecn-cy'd monster, vvliich duth mock The meat it feed* on. Tor, oh I v*.lint dmnii'd miutites tctls lie o'er, Who dotes, yet donl-tsj susjiccu, yet strongly lores I SllAKtSlT.AUE. Upon cool reflection, in the privacy of his pillow, lord Montalban condemned himself for having acted so precipitately, in promising lady Cecilia that he would marry Georgina so soon; for though he consid--rrd Eleanor as lost to him, yet his soul revolted at the idea of marrying a woman for whom he felt not the slight¬ est affection, so necessary to render the married state happy; and he now blamed his hasty temper, which had thus prompt¬ ed him to act. Lady Cecilia quickly communicated the news of her nephew's sudden obedi-
ence to lady Lenox, who accordingly conveyed it to her daughter. Lady Glendinning was somewhat sur¬ prised. She was herself a close observer of human nature, and had beSield the visi¬ ble attention of lord Montalban to Elea¬ nor, which made her put no faith in this hasty determination of his; and she far¬ ther considered, that if he actually became the husband of Georgina, it was absolutely necessary that Eleanor should be removed from his sight, as she was convinced, that lord Montalban would continue to encou¬ rage sentiments injurious to the peace of her own child: nor can we blame her la¬ dyship for these considerations; as a mo- ther, she naturally felt for the welfare of her daughter. These ideas were strength¬ ened by the observations which she drew on the succeeding conduct of lord Mont¬ alban, who, on paying his next, visit to St. Michael's, exhibited a countenance of such uneasiness as could not/ail of attract¬ ing the notice of all. Eleanor was present on his lordship's
entrance: her feelings were acute as slie met his glance: it was the first inter¬ view since the fatal circumstance of the letter, and she felt humiliated as the idea of having been obliged to beg his secrecy crossed her imagination r * a blush over¬ spread her face, which lord Montalban be 1 * held with varying ideas. The first mo¬ ment he was enraptured with her modest and bewitching demeanour, but he re^ collected the scene of the preceding even¬ ing, and the modest blush of virtue- and innocence was converted by him as a feeling arising from conscious guilt. He bowed politely to her, and addressed him¬ self to lady Glendinning .and Georgina, who, delighted with her supposed' tri¬ umph, laughed and talked with great vi¬ vacity. ' Poor Eleanor felt the cause too. Surely she knew the real meaning of lord Mont¬ alban's behaviour, and, as soon as possible; she withdrew from a scene so painful to her feelings. During her absence, lord Montalban.
was a prey to all the pangs of jealousy r one moment he believed Eleanor to be alt baseness and falsehood, and the next he endeavoured to persuade ■ himself, that, though appearances' were against her, she might be innocent. In this state, bet veen doubt and hope, he continued during the few days of the family remaining at the castle. Lady Glendinning continued positive in her orders for Eleanor to attend her to London. Lord Arthur had kept himself close con¬ fined to his own room. A prey to de* spair and melancholy, the evening pre-* vious to the day on which the journey was to commence, he requested to speak to lady Glendinning,. and again informed her, that it was his wish for Eleanor to remain in Scotland during her absence^ and therefore begged she would dispense with her attendance; Lady Glendinning,, seriously hurt at his,again importuning her. on the subject so gainful.to her feelings> replied, in tones
of anger; .positively ideclaring, that she should insist on using her own prerogative in this instance; arid that, if Eleanor,did not; .accompany ■ her, she would break her engagement with. lady Cecilia, ; and in¬ form all' parties of her reason for so doing; and expose his treatment .of her, ,and his preference to Eleanor, to the world.. This threat was not very agreeable to lord;Arthur, who knew he should meet the censure of all around.' We have also hinted that he privately wished for the departure of lady Glendinning, and he feared lest he should prevent it, by persist¬ ing in his, request for Eleanor; and though it was a source of real grief to sec her quit the castle, yet,, in the present instance, he could not contend with propriety. This ,contcst however proved a serious one, and eventually attended with great danger'to-lord Arthur and'his lady,.,who, highly displeased with him, threw» out many.bitterinvectives against his conduct towardslSlcanor; and at length,' after vio¬ lent altercation' on both sides, Jady Glen-
diniiing left his ^presence, more seriously offended than ever she had yet been with him. The seeds of discord seemed effec¬ tually sown in her bosom, and to take a deep and lasting root. She hastened to her own room. She flung herself on a chair: a few drops of burning anguish ran down her cheek, which, wiping away as wounded pride arose to her assistance, she mentally exclaimed—" 'Tis over I the struggle is great, but henceforth this wronged—this wounded bosom shall seek its own revenge-! Down, rebel Love! thy reign is .over, antl in thy place Resentment shall take her station." She continued weeping for a consider¬ able time, and in the privacy of her own room gave way to those softer feelings of her soul, of which she in reality possessed a considerable share, though generally concealed beneath the mask of pride. This evening proved an eventful v one to most of the .parties, at St. Michael's. AH were labouring under the most acute sensations, arising ,from the real and ima-
ginary'evils which they were suffering; All countenances exhibited a melancholy aspect, save those of Georgina, lady Le¬ nox, and lady Cecilia, who, delighted with the near completion of their project, were quite in spirits. Eleanor was pensive, sad, and abstract¬ ed ; and it was evident, that, as their de¬ parture drew near, h?r dejection increased. This was observed by the two elder ladies, who were somewhat surprised, as they had imagined she would have been de¬ lighted with the journey, knowing lord Montalban was to be of the party. They did not however trouble themselves long in conjecturing the cause of her sadness; they only exulted in the prospect of soon eventually separating her from him for ever. . Lord Montalban was at this time per¬ haps the greatest object of pity: a prey to contending passions, one moment re¬ solving to forget Eleanor, and the next doting more on her than ever, he con¬ tinued a prey to that dreadful torment
jealousy. It was with the most distract¬ ing doubt that he passed night after night, a constant witness to the evening rambles of Eleanor, the mystery of which no one could fathom. On this eventful night, lord Montalban strolled to the castle, in order to ascertain if the ladies would be in readiness to attend lady Cecilia on the following day. He was informed lady Glendinning was in her own room, and Georgina was the only one visible. In vain he looked for Eleanor; she was, as usual, absent; and after staying a very short time with Georgina, he made an ex¬ cuse for retiring early. Deeply fixed in thought, he pursued his way, and took the turning from the castle which led' to the sea. Eleanor alone occupied his thoughts, and the idea of the journey to London gave him a ray of pleasure. In the thought of her being also to accompany them, he should still have the happiness of being with her, and of witnessing her conduct; and what was
a still greater source of delight, she would be removed from the sight of her secret correspondent, who was doubtless a for¬ midable rival. He pleased himself with the idea of still gaining her affections, and in the anticipation of the future, began to forget the past; and from kophig that Eleanor would be able to clear herself from all suspicion, he at last persuaded himself that it actually was so. , In deep reflections of this nature, he continued walking until he found himself by thp side of those stupendous rocks by the sea. He paused. The scene was congenial to his feelings: a calmness al¬ most bordering on solemnity reigned around—the waves were peculiarly still, «nd the foaming billows hushed to si¬ lence. Wilih an instinctive melancholy, he climbed a craggy point of the rock, and seated himself, and fixing his eyes on the heavens, gave way to his thoughts. A deep sigh at length aroused him from his.reveije. He started and gazed around.
The shades of night were fast encircling the earth, and rendered objects but par¬ tially discernible. Lord Montalban, in some surprise, lis¬ tened attentively, and distinctly heard the low murmuring of voices. He looked around, and at length caught a sentence which engrossed his whole attention,— " Oh! my Eleanor!" exclaimed a voice, in the tenderest accents, " must we theii part? Alas! what will support nie dur¬ ing the cruel time of our separation. Oh! would you could have prevented this fatal journey!" " Alas!" replied a voice which lord Montalban too well knew to be that of Eleanor, " I dare not disobey the com¬ mands of lady Glendinning, although they are to me distressing. Oh! think what I must suffer in thus leaving you ! Believe me, your Eleanor's grief is equal to your own. Oh! my beloved—■—" A sudden gust of wind, which arose upon the waves, prevented lord'Montal¬ ban hearing the conclusion of the •speech.
His disappointment was excessive, as he had expected to have heard the name of his rival, which Eleanor was doubtless about to pronounce. His feelings were aroused almost to agony—he gazed wildly around, but could not discern any object. Determined, if possible, to gain a sight of his rival, he turned to where he still thought he heard the voices. He stood on a craggy part of the rock which jutted out so as to prevent his seeing the next chasm, where he fancied he heard the voices. Almost at the hazard of his life, he climbed to the top of the projection c-n which he stood, and looking over, be¬ held, to his great surprise, a large opening in this work of nature, which formed a rude apartment; but who shall describe his distraction, his horror, and his jealou¬ sy, on beholding Eleanor seated by the side of a figure, who was fervently clasp¬ ing her in his embrace! He was clad in the costume of their country, with a plaid gracefully thrown over his shoulders. His appearance was
evidently prepossessing, but lord Montal¬ ban could not gain a sight of his face, as he threw himself on the shoulder of Elea¬ nor, who, with the utmost affection, was returning his caresses.—" Oh! be comfort¬ ed," she criec, " we shall meet again in happiness and love." Lord Montalban, in a state of distrac¬ tion, was just on the point of leaping down, and sacrificing his rival to his fury, but a moment's consideration pointed out to him the fallacy of such a proceeding. His own life might fall the sacrifice to such an attempt, as the height was great; besides, his pride whispered him Eleanor was unworthy his concern; her falsehood was apparent, and he would not give her the triumph of seeing how much she had distressed him. He was now in posses¬ sion of the knowledge of her having a se¬ cret favoured lover, and with the incon¬ sistency of thought which pervades us in the moment of painful conviction, he fan¬ cied he should now be easy. He there¬ fore softly crept down the rock, and re-
treated unobserved. With a sort of apa¬ thy he left the place, and walked quickly along, hardly conscious of what he was doing; nor was he scarcely aware of his arrival at his own home, until he heard the voice of lady Cecilia sounding in his ears, and he then found that he was actually in his own drawing-room. He seated himself on a chair without replying to his aunt, who now looking on him, exclaimed __« Why, Frederick, what is the matter with you ? are you not well ?" " Well, madam!" he repeated, staling wildly ; " yes, I am quite well. I thank you, I never felt better in all my life." " Has any thing occurred to vex you ?" inquired lady Cecilia: " you look the pic¬ ture of misery personified." " You are under a mistake, madam," replied lord Montalban, forcing a smile into his face, and walking gaily about the room. " I am particidarly happy. I was never more fully satisfied than I am at this moment." " You have an odd way of shewing
your happiness then," returned lady Ce¬ cilia. " I was just then lost in my own ab¬ struse reflections." " Abstruse indeed," re-echoed her lady¬ ship, " for you appeared absolutely ab¬ sorbed in your own thoughts. May I ask of what nature they were ?" " I was just then considering, madam," cried lord Montalban, " what circum¬ stance could possibly afford me the great¬ est pleasure upon earth." " A very pleasant consideration in¬ deed," replied lady Cecilia ; " and pray, my lord, have you decided this very diffi¬ cult point ?" " I have," returned his lordship: " I think the greatest pleasure I can now know will be that of wedding Georgina immediately. Yes," continued he, " that, will be a glorious revenge indeed." He pausetl, and unheedful of the pre¬ sence of his aunt, fell again into deep thought vol. ii. H
" Really, Frederick," cried lady Cecilia, in an angry tone, " I do not know how to comprehend you. Is revenge the only motive you have to induce you to unite yourself to Miss Glendinning?" " Prpy pardon my inconsistency," in¬ terrupted his lordship, " and impute not my present behaviour to a want of respect towards yourself; on the contrary, I once more repeat my wishes of being enabled to please yon, and be assured I am now willing to unite myself to Georgina as soon as possible; in doing which I shall have the heartfelt satisfaction of saving a father from ruin. Yes," he added, with increased energy, " that thought will sup¬ port me through all." " Be satisfied as to that," dear Frede¬ rick," cried the delighted lady Cecilia; " your obedience to my wishes shall not go unrewarded: you know my vast wealth will in that case devolve upon your father and yourself, and the heiress of St. Michael and my nephew shall be the wealthiest pair in Scotland."
She then entered into a long detail of their mutual high descent, a subject very unsuitable to the present disposition of lord Montalban, who was in a state of mind to hate himself and ail the world; yet, inconsistent as his conduct may ap¬ pear to the reader, he spoke his real senti¬ ments at the moment, in declaring his wish to unite himself to Georgina; for so convinced was he now of the baseness of Eleanor, that he felt ashamed and morti¬ fied at the idea of having so openly de¬ clared his love to her, as no doubt she was .exulting in the idea of leading him in her chains. His hasty and impetuous temper caught the alarm, and like all who are acting under the unworthy passion of re¬ venge, he forgot, in fulfilling its dictates, that he should be the greater sufferer than her on whom he meant to inflict the punishment: he thought only on reveng¬ ing himself on Eleanor, without reflecting that, in uniting himself to Georgina, he should most probably seal his own misery h2 -
for ever, as she was the last woman upon eavth who would have constituted his hap- ness. Thus, while he was arranging the most serious and important affair of his life, he was dictated in its formation by his disappointed hopes with Eleanor-, and so very importunate was he with his aunt, respecting a speedy alliance with Miss Glendinning, that lady Cecilia was convinced some particular motive induced him to this unexpected obedience. She was a woman who well knew by her own experience, that the passions are incapable of control or reason, when un¬ der the influence of disappointed love; yet she cared not under what principles lord Montalban united himself to Georgi¬ na as long as her wish was fulfilled; and finding her nephew in such a complying mood, she now arranged all affairs relative to the intended union. At length, lord Montalban, wearied of a subject which he soon found gave him pain, notwithstanding his boasted resolu¬ tion, retired abruptly from her presence,
and repairing to his own room, reflected on the cruel disappointment given to his hopes by the falsehood and baseness of Eleanor.
CHAPTER VIII.
IlaJsi thou been true, Thrre's not a charm, a power, which earth doth own, Should have estrang'd my love. I would have scrv'd th<:«> Iu bonrls or death, with absolute devotion. Friends, kindred, father, brother,, native place,. Had been-as nothing: thou fo me hadst been Father, and brother, and'dear relative, And friend, and native place. I had trusted thee, With an unbounded sway o'ar my warm heart. RlClIAKDS. Though lord Montalban had exerted his; powers of resolution in the presence of his aunt, yet, on finding himself alone, the natural feelings of his heart gave way, and though " unused to the melting mood," he actually shed the tears of bitter disap¬ pointment. From the commencement of his acquaintance with Eleanor, he had fondly fancied her an object worthy of his utmost regard and admiration: he had
yielded his heart to her without restraint, and to withdraw it was a greater difficulty than he could combat; yet the only way that presented itself to his distracted fancy was that of uniting himself to Georgina: he felt his own hopes of happiness were for ever blighted, and he was indifferent to the future. In deep melancholy he remained in his chamber, while lady Ce¬ cilia sought her friend, lady Lenox, and acquainted her with her nephew's willing¬ ness to obey their wishes. This news was quickly communicated at St. Michael's Castle, and Eleanor heard with anguish at heart the arrangements made for the intended union, which lady Lenox declared should take place on their return to Scotland. If Eleanor was really hurt at these ex¬ pressions, purposely thrown out before lier, what were her feelings, when on the following morning, lord Montalban paid a visit, to see if the ladies were ready for their journey, and to take his farewell of lord Arthur ? On entering the drawing-
.room, and seeing Eleanor, he bowed to her slightly, and advanced towards Geor¬ gina, and taking her hand, inquired as to her health, and if she was ready, with the rest of the ladies, to honour him with their company to London. Georgina, delighted with this unex¬ pected preference, answered him in the utmost good humour, and continued talk¬ ing with him in a strain far from inele¬ gant, which she could command, if she chose, that lie began to think he should not be so very unhappy in being united to her, while the idea of his attention so pleased the giddy Georgina that she be¬ came all sweetness and complaisance. Poor Eleanor was a silent spectator of this scene, and attributed his lordship's behaviour as arising from the circumstance of the unfortunate letter which he had perused.—" He is lost then to me for ever," she mentally exelaimed, " and he thinks me guilty and culpable. Oh, cruel fate! what more canst thou have in store for me ? I could have borne all this, but
to be thus lessened in the eyes of him who of all beings on earth I most value, is painful in the extreme. Oh, how shall I support this trying conflict!" Thus sighed Eleanor, but had she been aware of the scene to which lord Montal¬ ban had been witness, she would not have wondered at his present conduct. He was indeed as unhappy as herself, but she knew not the workings of \m soul; she saw plainly that he was purposely wound¬ ing her feelings, and supposing it to be entirely through the mysterious letter, she considered that he was acting too se¬ vere. He was of course now lost to her, as she dared not reveal the error under which he lay. Pensive and silent she re¬ mained in her chair, when casting her eyes upwards, she beheld those of lord Montalban fixed on her, with an expres¬ sion of soilness mixed with resentment His features gradually relaxed into a ten¬ der smile as he gazed on her, but it was.
but a momentary emotion; he recollected her duplicity, and turned from her. This action, though trifling, was too much for Eleanor to bear; tlie tears trem¬ bled in her eyes, and fearful lest she should betray her weakness, she immediately arose and left the room. Lord Montalban marked her hasty de¬ parture, and construed it into a conscious¬ ness of her own guilt, which could not bear his scrutiny. He sighed at the con¬ viction, and feeling himself unable to command his spirits sufficiently to con¬ verse with Georgina, he also arose, and reminding them the time was drawing near for their departure, he expressed his wish to take his leave of Iced Arthur, if he would admit him to his presence. " His lordship is closely confined to his own chamber," cried lady Glendinning. " I have not seen him since yesterday, but I dare say he will be very glad of a visit from your lordship. I will send to inform him," she continued, at the same time
ringing the bell. She desired the servant to say°to his master, that lord Montalban wished for an interview. The man left the room, and returned' immediately with lord Arthur's compli¬ ments, and that he should be glad to see lord Montalban in the library directly. " I thought you would be a welcome visitor, my lord," said lady Glendinning; " I know you have ever been a great fa¬ vourite with his lordship. If you please," she added, " you will say to him that the time of our departure is near, if he wishes to take leave of his family." Lord Montalban bowed and withdrew to the library, where, dejected and ill at ease, sat lord Arthur. He arose on the entrance of lord Montalban, and taking him by the hand, exclaimed—" I am par¬ ticularly obliged to you, my lord, for this visit. I had flattered myself that you would not quit Scotland witl.cut bidding me farewell, and you have not disappoint¬ ed my wishes; for though circum&t tnces have occurred to consign me to the sibom
and solitude of my own chamber, yet, be¬ lieve me,' my heart is still open to the feelings of friendship, and I know no one on whom I would so soon bestow it as yourself." ** Your lordship does me much honour," returned lord Montalban, " and I trust I shall ever continue deserving of your good opinion. The friendship of lord Arthur must be of value, as he is not apt to be¬ stow it indiscriminately on any one; and it affords me the highest satisfaction also in the pleasing hope, that wh.cn allied by the closest tics to his family, he will still honour me with his esteem and approba¬ tion." " Of that be assured," replied lord Ar¬ thur; " few events can afford me so oreat a pleasure as that of seeing you allied to me, and by the way most congenial to your feelings. Believe me, I would wish to promote your real happiness, and rest assured of my full approbation and con¬ sent to your utmost wishes." Lord Arthur paused, and looked on
lord Montalban. He firmly believed his affections were fixed on Eleanor, to whom he really wished to see him united; and he doubted not but lord Montalban would joyfully have seized this present opportu¬ nity of opening his heart to him, so warm- l3 r encouraged. Lord Montalban felt confused; he could not but understand the allusion of lord Arthur, and had it been some time pre¬ vious, he would joyfully have declared the true situation of his heart, and have implored his consent and interference for his union with Eleanor. Under the pre¬ sent circumstances, however, it was im¬ possible : he therefore feigned not to un¬ derstand lord Arthur as alluding to Geor¬ gina, and replied—" I must again repeat my thanks for your lordship's kindness, and I shall, with the greatest pleasure, obey the wishes of my friends, and fulfil the dictates of my own heart, in receiving the hand of the lovely Georgina, which prize is awarded to me on our return from London."
Lord Arthur looked on him with sur¬ prise. He had expected that he would have acknowledged his love for Eleanor;; but how disappointed was he at this de¬ claration ! he doubted his veracity, but after such an avowal as he had now made,. in favour too of his own daughter,, he* could not urge the subject any forther. He therefore reverted to the inJ^Kded journey.—" I did not wish to prevent lady Glendinning from accompanying lady Cecilia to London," he exclaimed, " as she appeared to have so great an inclina¬ tion to it herself; but I must own to you, lord ,Monlalban, that I am not pleased at the junior part of my family being also of the party: not that I have any fears for my son Robert; he is a youth, I am confident, of strict integrity and unsullied principles, and will doubtless view the riotous scenes of that gay resort of fashion with abhorrence; while with Georgina I think it will have no other effect than that of perhaps increasing the gaiety of disposition which is her natural temper.
She is formed to mix With the gay world, and to enter into all its scenes of mirth; Her spirits are, I am confident, equal to the task of supporting the fatigues, atten¬ dant on a lady of fashion, whose whole life is a continual waste of time, hurried from one scene to another, without being able to taste the real pleasures of social society; such a life as this would, I think* not be displeasing to Georgina; but there is another for whose peace I tremble, r.nd who I would have wished not to have been of the party; but in this instance I find even my commands prove abortive." "To whom does your lordship allude?" cried lord Montalban, in a confused voice, as his own heart whispered the name which lord Arthur was about utter. " To the lovely, the pure, and unso¬ phisticated Eleanor,'' he exclaimed, in a tone of energy; " it is for her I fear; she is formed by nature sensible, tender, and susceptible of all those softer amiable weaknesses of her sex. Unpractised in the dangerous arts of the deceiving world,
she is the most likely to fall a victim to its temptations. I speak by sad experience, and that female who is most adorned with every perfection is the one chosen by man for his devoted prey: should my Eleanor fall a victim to a lawless libertine, or be¬ come the dupe of a villain, my cup of sor¬ row would be full. Oh, Montalban!" he continued, " be you her protector from such a fate as this! Watch over her, and guard her innocence from the cruel de- spoiler of virtue 1 It is perhaps a strange request for me to make to you, who are yourself so young a man ; but my confi¬ dence in you is unbounded, and to your care I commit my Eleanor." Lord Montalban was greatly affected at this address.—" Oh, how gladly would 1 become her protector for ever!" he men¬ tally uttered; but recollecting her sup¬ posed falsehood, he subdued the rising feelings of his heart, and thus replied— " My lord, I will indeed do my utmost to watch over the actions of Eleanor, for much she stands- in need of a protector.""
" You surpriCvG me by this answer," in¬ terrupted lord Arthur; " you speak as if you were aware of some part of her con¬ duct which requires an investigation." Lord Montalban coloured ; he was vex¬ ed with himself for his incautious answer, as he was determined never to betray Eleanor. She had begged his pity and his silence, and he resolved to adhere to the promise he had made her.—" Oh, no. my lord," he replied, " you mistake; I mean she does indeed require the most vigilant protection, owing to her youth and extreme beauty, for what man could gaze on her lovely countenance without feeling himself enslaved ? and when such a gem as this shall be exposed to the rude stare of a London libertine, I agree with you, my lord, that its result may be dan¬ gerous ; but as far as my humble counsel or protection can assist her, I solemnly promise your lordship I will extend to¬ wards the safety of your lovely Eleanor." " I thank you," returned lord Arthur, ** and will rest contented on your promise,
for I think you also feel an interest in her welfare." " Oh, who can feel so much ?'* interrupt* ed lord Montalban, again thrown off his guard; when, recollecting himself, he added, " I shall shortly have the honour of being related to her, and as a dear sister I hope I shall ever regard her." Lord Arthur again felt disappointed by this reply, and was determined to give lord Montalban no farther opportunities, as he saw he was averse to owning his love for Eleanor; and he felt rather angry with him for it. Lord Montalban now arose, as the time was pressing, and taking lord Arthur's hand, bade him an adieu.—" Farewell, my lord," he cried, " may health and hap¬ piness attend you until next^ we meet !■"' " That wish, in its fullest extent, I return to you," replied lord Arthur; " may you enjoy a course of uninterrupted tranquil¬ lity ! Whilst in the solitude and silence of my native home, I shall seek for that repose which the world cannot give me.*
He wrung the hand of lord Montalban, who, once more taking a friendly leave, retired from the room, and lord Arthur sunk much affected into his chair. Not¬ withstanding the many obstacles which arose to prevent an union between lord Montalban and Eleanor, he had cherished the idea of promoting such an event, which would have afforded him the high¬ est satisfaction, particularly as he had thought their affections were fixed on each other; but the present behaviour of lord Montalban completely astonished and dis¬ concerted him; he still believed that his heart was Eleanor's, but that through his peculiar situation he was endeavouring to force his inclinations tb meet the wishes of his friends; but be that as it would, lord Arthur felt that he could not inter* fere any more on the subject. He continued in a musing strain for a considerable length of time, until a ser¬ vant entered the room, and informed his lordship that lady Glendinning wished to know if he had any commmds, as her la?
dyship and family were ready to com¬ mence their journey. Lord Arthur started.—" Tell Miss Elea¬ nor Glendinning to come to me immedi¬ ately and alone," he cried. The servant withdrew, and lord Arthur paced the room in violent agitation.-— " She is also then going to leave me!" he exclaimed, " Oh, how shall I endure a .separation from her! yet I must fortify my resolution, or expose all my weakness to my family, who would in consequence spurn me from them with contempt." He paused as the door opened, and Efeanor stood before him. She was clad in a travelling habit, which gave a be¬ witching elegance to her graceful figure. Her countenance was pale and dejected, and the starting tears were visible in her eyes. Lord Arthur took her by the hand, and looked mournfully in her face.—" You are going to leave me, Eleanor," he cried, « and tb quit your peaceful native home for the gay resort of splendour and fashion^
May the journey prove more productive of pleasure to you than it does to me!'* '* Ah no, my lord," interrupted Elea¬ nor, " not one spark of satisfaction or pro¬ mised joy does it afford me. I go, 'tis true, but only, alas! in obedience to the commands of lady Glendinning, who wishes for my attendance; but believe me, my lord, I shall hail the moment of my return as the happiest of my life." " Have you then no inclination for scenes of gaiety," cried lord Arthur, " so natural to youth and inexperience like yours ?" " Ah, no, my lord, my mind is not at¬ tuned to such scenes as those. On the contrary, it gives me tlie greatest pain to quit my native plains." " And yet, Eleanor," interrupted lord Arthur, " you have nothing to regret; you will be accompanied by your friends, some part of whom, I know, deserve your regard. You cannot feel the separation from a de.ar-object;; yo.u will leave none beside myself, for whom you feel an inte-
rest. You will not experience the bitter pangs of a separation from all you hold most dear." " Oh yes, my lord, I shall," exclaimed the weeping Eleanor; "believe me I shall feel all those pangs you are describing in their fullest force, for when I quit Sco¬ tia's wide domains, I leave behind mc those who are the dearest to this aching heart, which can taste no peace or joy until I am restored to their arms." " Noble, affectionate Eleanor," cried lord Arthur, tenderly embracing her; " how this avowal delights me, since I am in¬ cluded in the regrets of my Eleanor, as no one else can claim your grief but my¬ self! I alone remain behind, as lord Montalban is to accompany you." " Lord Montalban!" repeated Eleanor, in great confusion ; " why does your lord¬ ship thus mention his name ? his presence cannot obliterate the anguish I feel at leaving my more than father. Oh, lord' Arthur, pity my sufferings, and teach me fortitude!" ".
" You ask me for that which I am- incapable of bestowing: I am bankrupt in it myself; I cannot express what I feel at parting from you, yet I would feign give you a few words before we separate, to warn you against the dangers with which you will shortly be surrounded. You are now going, my Eleanor, for the first time, to view that gay abode of virtue and of vice. Its appearance is fascinating, and its temptations numerous. You will doubtless be charmed by its glittering in¬ vitations to pleasure, but fly from its al¬ lurements, if you would avoid sorrow, re¬ gret, and shame: shun all amusements which your reason cannot approve: never suffer yourself to be a partaker in any of its fashionable follies or vices, merely be¬ cause of ' the world's dread laugh.' On the contrary, soar above such a contemp¬ tible weakness, which could at best only raise you in the estimation of those whose good opinion would prove of more harm to you than their disapprobation. Virtue and modesty like yours, my dear Eleanor,
is by far the safest, when it is afraid to obtrude itself on the great theatre of life; it shrinks from observation, and by that means escapes from the dangers of admira¬ tion. You will meet with various charac¬ ters and dispositions in London: mark them all: all are useful in their turn to the reflecting mind. If you converse with the man of honour and of reason, listen to his precepts and copy his virtues. On the other hand, should you meet with the vicious and depraved, let that also prove of service to you; for as you wit¬ ness their guilt and consequent misery, let it teach you to avoid their example. In short, from the most minute circum¬ stance, a good moral may be derived. But, my Eleanor, do not suffer the picture I have drawn to give you an abhorrence of London; on the contrary, I am a warm admirer of its many excellencies. Eng¬ land is a country which can boast of deeds sufficient to exalt it to that title which it so nobly deserves. Its bravery and cou¬ rage are almost unprecedented, and its
charities numerous^ and well-selected. It iscnot the^vrrtubusH part i of'i this highly- gifted j country 'with; whom :I fear of your .associating^^as from:;many^ofJits: exalted females you would learn those -real jgraces which constitute feminine..perfection.

" True, I have not seen her since yesterday. She has forfeited my esteem for ever, in acting thus in opposi¬ tion to my wishes." , " Oh, say not* so, my lord," interrupted the weeping Eleanor. " Let not an un¬ fortunate object like myself be the cause of such continual dissensions. The time, I hope, my lord, will not be of long dura¬ tion ere I shall return to these peaceful walls, and to the affectionate arms of your lordship, who will, I trust, sometimes be¬ stow a thought on his absent Eleanor." Lord Arthur caught her in his embrace. __« Every thought, my dearest girl," he cried, " shall be directed for your, welfare. This separation moves me more than I can describe. Farewell, my JEleanor! may every blessing be yours!"
He fervently imprinted a kiss on ;her cheek, as the door opened, and lady Glen-, dinning made her appearance. , • , Eleanor felt herself confused, as she, withdrew from lord Arthur; while her^ ladyship, looking on both with scrutiny, exclaimed—" I should not thus have ob¬ truded myself on your lordship's privacy, j conscious as I am that it is unwished, but the carriages are waiting at the door, and ; in consequence of your detaining Eleanor- so, long, I was under the necessity of. re¬ questing her attendance." " I beg your ladyship's pardon," replied Eleanor, " but I am now ready to, attend you; and I trust your ladyship's own good heart will excuse my weakness, as I cannot, for the first time in my life, part from lord Arthur without shedding the, tear of regret." " Oh, no doubt," returned her ladyship.; " I expected the parting from you would be felt much by his lordship, so much so that I suppose he forgets he has two more' x.2 ,

With feelings of a varying nature lady Glendinning remained for a short time bilent. The struggle in her heart was oreat She at length addressed him. A O cj short conversation ensued, the result of which did not prove favourable to her
,173 ladyship, who rushed from the room in violent agitation, as her sou and daughter entered the apartment. Lord Arthur bestowed on both a pa¬ ternal embrace, $nd\ was'pleased to find that Georgina really possessed a greater tenderness of disposition than he expected. She shei,, the., tear, of sensibility, ,while Robert betrayed great emotion at parting from his father ;'''and , on 1 their quitting his presence', lord Arthur, sunk into a state of despondency.—" Farewell!" he exclaim¬ ed; "a long' ; fare'well to all!

' I may now indeed, doubly exclaim—,' Qh, .Elea¬ nor, where art Hum ?" • • ' '

On retiring from lord Arthur, Eleanor immediately sought the privacy of her own chamber, and there gave way to the feelings of her heart. She was indeed much affected at the parting with lord
Arthur, and she wished, if possible, to calm her mind before she again appeared in the presence of lady Glendinning. She succeeded in banishing the marks of sorrow from her countenance, and fear¬ ing lest her ladyship should be waiting for her, she descended to the drawing- room. As she opened the door, she dis¬ tinctly heard a deep sigh, accompanied with a sob of agony, and beheld lady Glendinning leaning on a chair, weeping violently. Eleanor, somewhat astonished, hastened to her side.—" Has any thing particular occurred ?" cried Eleanor, in a voice of timidity and apprehension. '* Why is your ladyship thus agitated ?" Lady Glendinning raised her handker¬ chief to her eyes, evidently wishing to conceal her tears, and turning coldly to Eleanor, replied—" Nothing, or at least not any thing which you can relieve." " Permit me to assuage your grief, if possible,", returned Eleanor. ." Believe me, your ladyship's evident emotion af-
fects me much. You say I cannot relieve it; suffer me al least then to participate in il." " You -participate in it!" repeated her ladyship, in a tone of violence. " You, who are the------" She paused, and -then added—" Leave me instantly. I am! not in the habit of communicating my griefs to any one, much less to you" Eleanor, greatly hurt at this ungracious treatment, hesitated.—" I had no inten-> tion of offending your ladyship," she cried. " My inquiries were dictated from motives of concern, not impertinence. 1 saw you absorbed in grief, and I wished to soften, not inflame your sorrows." " If you really wish then to oblige me," replied her ladyship, " you will do so by instantly retiring. Is am not in a humour to converse with you.' In a short time I shall be ready to commence my journey, till which time I choose to be alone." ■ Eleanor, of course, could 1 no longer re; main. She curtseyed/and instantly with-
drew to l( the dining-parlourr where f slip found Georgina and Robert; waiting for lady GJendinning. r ■ u f« j l, thought mamma was ready," ex¬ claimed the former. " Dp you know wtyrp she is?" ^ > 'i?' % " Her Aadyship is alone in the drawing- room," replied Eleanor, " and will.,1 dare say, in a few minutes join you." * ir»» Charles Lenox, now entered the*,rooitf. and informed them that lady Lenox had repaired to B------House, where she was waiting their arrival. < r> \ Charles Lenox, .with that friendly re¬ gard which he had always, evinced-.for Eleanor, bid her a tender adieu/ The sight of her visibly affected him. > Tlie likeness which she bore to the lost lady Frances still acted'as a powerful stimulus in his heare. As he had gradually -ad¬ vanced in years, he had conquered the violence of that passion which had em¬ bittered his youthful .days; but his love for lady Frances had been too ardent ever 13
to permit him to make a second choice. It will not therefore be' wondered at, ! that the form of Eleanor kept alive'those Sen¬ sations in his bosom, which time and'ma- turer reason had subdued to' a! proper calmness. " ' After a short time had elapsed, lady Glendinning made her appearance. Elea¬ nor cast a timid glance towards her, and beheld, with some surprise, the change in her countenance, which now wore its usual aspect; all traces of that extreme agitation which Eleanor had witnessed were gone, and in a tone of assumed cheer¬ fulness she inquired if all were ready? "' What a wonderful command of her feelings does she possess!" mentally re¬ flected Eleanor, as her ladyship led the way to the door. " A short time since, and 'she appeared overwhelmed with sor¬ row. Who would think the pride and satisfaction sparkling in her piercing eyes were but a mask to conceal her real' feel¬ ings ; for much am I mistaken if this is not the real state of her ladyship."
Lady Glendinning was now taking leave of her brother, when he declared his intention of accompanying them to B ------ House, and mounting his horse, rode by the side of their carriage. As Eleanor entered, she cast her eyes on the castle, which she was going to quit. She looked towards the chamber of f lord Arthur, and beheld him standing at its window. He waved his hand to her. She returned it, and a fresh flood of tears,burst from her eyes. Robert and Georgina cast a last look upon him also; while lady Glendinning threw herself into a corner of the carriage, and hid herself from his view. " There is papa at his window," said Georgina, looking towards her ladyship. , " So ( I supposed" she coldly replied. The carriage drew on, and all remained in, silence. Eleanor looked on her with astonish¬ ment.—" Pan it be possible," she mentally ejaculated, " for a wife thus coldly to,quit hei- husband.—not so much as bestow one
last, one parting glance ? Oh, lord Ar¬ thur, unhappy and culpable as thou art, j r et thy affectionate heart merits a better return." i - As the carriage drew near J3- -----House, Eleanor felt much agitation. It was the first time she had ever approached it, and as she heard they were to enter it, she was extremely embarrassed. She leant her face towards the window of the car¬ riage, in order to conceal her agitation**; but after a few minutes she involuntarily claspe'd her hands together. A deep sigh stole from her lips, and bursting into tears, she sunk back on her seat. "Are you not well, Eleanor?" cried lady Glendinning, evidently much surprised at her conduct!. s " f Oh, yes," she replied, " I am quite well. I beg your ladyship's pardon ; it is the effects of weakness only. My spirits are uncommonly "depressed." Lady Glendinning shook her head, as in a mild tone she exclaimed—" You must endeavour to conquer this violence of feel-
ing. ii Learn fortitude* Eleanor, for that alone can support you in the hour of trial. When you know more of the world, 1 you will find, that if every one wore the stamp of their real feelings, we should scarce see one happy 1 or'cheerful countenance. In London* you will behold faces smiling', eyes sparkling with vivacity, whilst ming¬ ling with the gay votaries of pleas'ure^ while their hearts area prey to'sorrow, and carrying a thorn rankling with despair " " Is it possible," cried the artless Elea¬ nor, ** that human nature can possess such command of feelings as your ladyship de¬ scribes ?" ' - " 'Tis indeed very possible, and ve?y true" she replied, sighing very deeply. She was' proceeding, f but the carriage stopped at B------ House. Charles Lenox assisted in handing out the ladies, but as he took tlie hand of Eleanor) he felt it tremble so violently, that he 1 would not relinquish it, '"but pass¬ ing it through his own arm, supported hei* into the house. Though he had'hither-
to been a silent spectator on the conduct of lord Montalban and Eleanor, yet-he had .not been an uninterested one. Pie was convinced their affections were fixed upon>each other, and he only waited some favourable opportunity to hefriend his young favourite, and knowing the ungra¬ cious treatment she had received from his own mother and lady Cecilia, he resolved to protect her while in the house of the latter. Lord Montalban, equipped for travelling, met them on the stairs, and on approach¬ ing Eleanor, contending passions assailed him. Love and resentment both had al¬ ternate sway; yet Eleanor demanded his polite attention, as being his guest, and he welcomed her to the house of his father. Eleanor could not trust her speech, as bowing therefore only in return, she pro¬ ceeded, still leaning on the arm of Charles, into the drawing-room, where sat the mar¬ quis of B—r-* and ladies Cecilia,Gray and Lenox. , , All wer^ received with pleasure, except-
ing poor Eleanor, who was not noticed, until the marquis of B------, who knew her but' slightly, arose, and paid her the greatest respect.' "•• ■'■■■'■•"[ - Charles Lenox immediately presented her to liim.-^-^" I believe," he cried, "this is the first time my young friend has had the pleasure of entering your lordship's house. Permit me to introduce her to your notice." " That it is the first time," he replied, '* I can only regret; but I now hope that it "will not be the last. On your return to Scotland, I shall be happy to see so amiable a young lady constitute many of my family parties." Eleanor curtseyed. — "Your lordship does me much honour," she returned. *• I fully feel your kindness." She paused, as she saw the eyes of lady Cecilia turned on her brother with furious rage. She cast also so contemplative a glance on Eleanor, that, unable to bear it, she again burst into tears. She felt her situation particularly embarrassing. Lord
Montalban she, saw was observing lier, and with -a view of/concealing her semo- tioivshe turned towards the window, and, as the rest of the party were now ah\con- versing--together,'she gave vent to -her r tears. ,A book layjn the window-seat-- she took it up, as if intent on that^ but the tears which dimmed, her eyes prevent¬ ed her from seeing 4tscontents.

" Spare me, sir," cried Eleanor; " you overwhelm me with this kindness. » I know not how to reply." Charles pressed her hand, as he felt gra¬ tified at the effect his generous intentions produced. • ' Lord Montalban, spite of his assumed indifference, looked delighted; while lady Cecilia, j bursting with spleen, cried— 'i What a foolish and ill-timed discussion has this book occasioned! For my part, I do not know how it came in my apart¬ ment at all—a ridiculous novel indeed!". " I have been so ridiculous as to read it," replied lord Montalban, smiling, " and must' own it afforded me much amuse¬ ment ; for I was just feeling and partici¬ pating in the raptures experienced by the happy Laurence Percival, in receiving its* lovely heroine as his own for ever."
Lord Montalban here bowed to Elea¬ nor, with looks of tenderness. l ■» In great confusion she averted her eyes, while the marquis, smiling, exclaimed— " Well said, Frederick;' but however love¬ ly she might have been, you must own the present bachelor's- lieiress surpasses all ideal beauties, and presents to us the charming reality of so pleasing a descrip¬ tion." 1 " I am glad, my lord, to find your ideas and my own coincide so well," replied lord Montalban, in a tone of exultation; but the look which his aunt cast upon him instantly checked his raptures. ' She was indeed almost furious, and tak¬ ing him by the arm,'she whispered in his ear—" You shall repent this, sir." 1 She then summoned them to the door, and, with lady Lenox, entered their tra¬ velling carriage; and lord Montalban found himself obliged to ^follow, as he was to J>e their escort. - * > ■ ■ .

J( The unexpected declaration of .Charles, Lenox filled 1 her with amaze¬ ment, made .top, dni the presence of the haughty Jady Cecilia, «who, she knew, con¬ sidered ( her only as a poor dependant. A momentary gratification^ .passed her mind, hut.it .was instantly chased away by an¬ other, .which surpassed all. > f> This was the ibehaviour of Jord Montalban, .who had again addressed, her an*terms, of v kindness. The approbation of lord Montalban, sur- vpassed' the.-wealth' of worlds, and ' the
pleasing conviction supported her during their journey, which was taken by easy stages. J Lord Montalban had' not much oppor¬ tunity of speaking to her, owing to their being in separate carriages, which ' was planned by the ladies Cecilia and Lenox'. He was a prey to the most uneasy sensa¬ tion, the perfidy of Eleanor still dwelling upon his mind. He heal seen, conviction forced itself upon his belief, and he could not doubt the evidenced!' his senses, and the remembrance of the scene between her and his supposed rival in the rocks tortured his imagination, and according as he had persuaded himself as to her guilt or innocence, so he behaved towards her; and Eleanor, ignorant of his real feel¬ ings, began to attribute liis varying be¬ haviour to caprice. In this way passed*on their journey,' which, as nothing occurred to prolong 1 it, was completed in safety; and Eleanor, with a palpitating heart, saw the white cliffs of Albion appear to her view. Her
admiration increased on reaching London; its noble structures, its wide and exten¬ sive streets, gratified her sight; and al¬ though used to the exalted buildings of Scotland's wide domains, she owned the vast taste displayed in the construction of the many elegant and serviceable build¬ ings with which London abounds. Lady Cecilia was in possession of a noble mansion in St. James's-square, to which place the party were conducted; and lady Cecilia welcomed her guests with ostenta¬ tious hospitality, Eleanor excepted, of whom she took not the least notice. She sighed to herself, at the idea of being obliged to reside under the roof of one who treated her with such pointed re¬ serve; and much it excited her wonder that she had been made one of the party, little imagining the plan which had been laid for her banishment from the family. Lord Montalban was particularly glad when their journey was completed, as during the whole time he had been lec¬ tured by his aunt for his behaviour to
Eleanor, t previous to their leaving B.—— House, and hearing ladyXenox comment on the folly of her son Charles, in declar¬ ing his intentions respecting Eleanor. He had been so pleased with the idea of her being declared heiress to the vast posses¬ sions of Charles, that he had forgotten his resolutions of erasing her from his heart; not that wealth could raise her in the esti¬ mation of his getierous mind, for, on the contrary, he would have gloried in raising her to his own rank, but he exulted in the idea, that her fortune v/ould be as much the means .of saving his father, as Geor¬ gia's ; nor could his aunt, as he supposed, now object to his uniting himself to her; nor was it until lady Cecilia and lady Le¬ nox reminded him of his willing promise to marry Georgina on their return to Scotland, that he roused himself from the pleasing delusion. It was now that the misery v of his situation again burst forth with redoubled horrors. The recollection of the conduct of Eleanor again crossed his mind, and drove him almost to, mad-

CHAPTER X. ****************** Thy thoughts are vagabonds, all outward bound, ]\li:t sands, and rocks, and storms, to cruise for pleasure, If gsitu'tl, dear bought, and better miss'd than gairfd. YOUKG. Lady Cecilia Gray, who was a complete master of the human passions, closely watched the actions of her nephew. She was entirely aware of the struggles passing in his bosom, she was fully convinced of the affection which subsisted mutually between Eleanor and himself, and she much feared that her darling hopes would yet be frustrat¬ ed, in the failure of lord Montalban making good his engagement with Georgina. She imparted her fears to lady Lenox, and they together agreed as to the neces¬ sity of removing Eleanor from the sight of lord Montalban, as their interviews were now rendered frequent by residing under the same roof.
Lady Lenox mentioned the subject to her daughter, insisting upon her writing to Mrs. Conway, to inform her of their being in town, and of their intention of visiting her. Lady Glendinning complied 'with the wishes of her mother. AlmosHn a state of passive submission, her ladysliip had sunk into a sort of melancholy, very differ¬ ent to her former disposition; since leaving St. Michael's Castle, scarce a smile had animated her countenance; and4o avoid the trouble of conversation or argument, she instantly complied with the directions of lady Lenox. A note was thejrefore dispatched to Mrs. Conway, at Camber¬ well Grove; and Eleanor, with some ( de¬ gree of pleasure, reflected, that perhaps with that lady she might be permitted to pass some of her time; and although she' was not exactly the woman she w'buld have chosen for her friend, yet she pre¬ ferred her society to those with whom she was now passing her time. Ever since ' K2
the cojd repulse with which lady Glendin¬ ning had treated her, previous to her leav¬ ing Scotland, she had felt embarrassed and intimidated ,in her presence; whilst her ladyship did not appear to give it a thought, but behaved towards her with civility bordering on reserve. One circumstance perplexed Eleanor. She had promised to write lord Arthur on her arrival in Eng¬ land, not doubting but she should also hear > her ladyship express her intentions of doing so; but some days having passed, Eleanor at length ventured to ask her ladyship if she were going to write to Scotland? Lady Glendinning replied, that Robert and'deorgina were about to send a packet, and that if she pleased, she could enclose a letter to lord Arthur, as no doubt she wished so to do. s ^Eleanor, of course, joyfully acquiesced, and retiring to her own room, wrote a long and affectionate letter to lord Arthur. She likewise availed herself of the plea of writing to keep her chamber, as solitude
ELEANOR. I9'7 was the most congenial to her feelings*, her situation was, of all others, the 1 most unpleasing one; for ever in the presence of lord Montalban, yet surrounded also by the keen observation of others, she knew not how to act, so as to escape re¬ proof. ?She had various reasons,' and p?i- vate ones, for esteeming lord Montalban, and it cost her many a painful struggle to treat with coldness the man whom, of all others, she most valued. ., Large parties of visitors already'began to crowd the house of lady Cecilia. Her rank in life insured her the respect of the fashionable world; and Eleanor gladly availed herself of the permission she al¬ ways had to retire to her own room; while lord Montalban, forced by his haugh¬ ty aunt to mix with the company, had a more arduous task to sustain. It was soon whispered that Georgina was his intended bride, and he found him¬ self, in a manner, compelled to attend her side, while his thoughts reverted from the
gay room to that of Eleanor, in which he knew she sat alone and deserted. A short .time however made a great .alteration in her situation, as, on the re¬ ceipt of lady Glendinning's note, Mrs. Conway immediately ordered her carriage to St. James's-square, and on being intro¬ duced, declared she was so extremely glad of their arrival in town, that she could not rest a moment until she had paid her respects to them; adding, that it was so extremely genteel in her ladyship to have written her herself. On seeing Eleanor, she evinced great pleasure and satisfaction, and begged,that she would now avail herself of every, op¬ portunity ,to visit her at Camberwell Grove. Eleanor immediately promised to pass as much time with her as lady Glendin-. ning would permit. ." Now that is kind of you," replied Mrs. Conway; " and I am sure I shall always be proud to receive lady Glendinning,
and the whole of her family, whenever they will choose to honour my house; but I was going to observe that, as doubtless your ladyship," continued she, addressing lady Glendinning, " will be most likely greatly taken up with large parties, you may perhaps not be enabled to give me much of your company; but probably you will grant me the society of Miss Eleanor for a short time; for Mr. Con¬ way is about making a small tour round the tioast with some male friends of his, and I shall be extremely dull without him." " Make yourself easy, madam, as to that point," replied lady Glendinning. " You shall have the company of Eleanor as long as you please, and when you please; and no doubt she will find herself extremely happy under your ; roof." Eleanor* rather surprised at this acqui¬ escence, curtseyed her thanks. Lady Lenox and lady Cecilia exchanged glances of great satisfaction. Lord Montalban looked chagrined;
while Mrs. Conway expressed her thanks in the warmest terms.—" I had hoped," she cried, " to have prevailed on you to accompany me home to dinner to-day, which, if you do, I can't see why you may not take up your residence with me, as her ladyship has so genteelly given her permission for you to come when you like.' r Eleanor, who thought she should be more happy under any one's roof than lady Cecilia's, expressed her readiness to attend her immediately, if lady Glendin¬ ning was agreeable to it* Her ladyship assented; while lady Ce* cilia, determined not to lose this oppor¬ tunity of removing her so effectually, cried—" I am really very glad Mrs. Con¬ way has given this invitation to Miss Eleanor, for though I am most happy to accommodate lady Glendinning's family, yet I must own my house is so full at present, and I expect so much company while I remain in town, that I shall be glad of a spare room, and no doubt she
will be more happy with Mrs. Conway than amongst the high circles which fre-* quent my house." 1 The blush of indignation pervaded the 1 cheek of Eleanor at this rude avowal. , Lord Montalban darted a look of anger on his aunt r while Eleanor exclaimed— " I was not aware, lady Cecilia,, that I was such an intruder in your ladyship's house,. which, could I have had my wish, would never have been the case, as I would gladly have remained at St Michael's; but it was the wish of lady Glendinning that I should accompany her, and of course 1 considered myself as entitled to her pro¬ tection, and while she continued to honour me with it, the same roof which received lier ladyship, I thought must also shelter me; but I am sorry to find I have been considered as an unwelcome visitor during my short visit in St James's-square, and can only repeat my willingness to remove myself immediately J* Lady Cecilia did not condescend to< make a reply; but lady Glendinning felt
for Eleanor; she saw how much she was hurt,' and in a mild tone she exclaimed— " Do not disturb yourself with such thoughts as those, Eleanor; lady Cecilia, I am, sure, could not mean to commit such a breach of hospitality, as to say she con¬ sidered'you as an intruder, as in that case we might all be deemed as such, for you observed rightly, when you said you con¬ sidered yourself as entitled to my protec¬ tion; arid while I afford it to you, you are of courseone of my family, and I shall notthink myself even a welcome visitor where the least part of my family is not the same." Eleanor turned a look of gratitude on her ladyship, while lady Cecilia coloured with vexation, and attempted to convince her ladyship of the pleasure she felt in her company. Lady Glendinning coldly bowed, and turning to Eleanor, cried—" My motive for wishing you to accompany Mrs. Con¬ way was for your own happiness; as for many ?-easons, I think you will find it under her roof in a greater degree than
.203
here. Trust me, Eleanor, I wish you well, but, unfortunately for me, I am in¬ volved in a gulph of trouble." She paused, as if suddenly recollecting herself. She continued—" No matter—I scarce know what I say. My head is in excessive pain, and I feel much indisposed." " Why, I must say," cried Mrs. Con¬ way, " that your ladyship does certainly look very ill. You don't look like the same person as when I saw you in Scot¬ land." Lady Lenox looked angrily at Mrs. Conway.—" There," she exclaimed, " you are like the generality of the world, who, the moment they hear another complain, generally comfort them with the assertion of informing them of the debility of their countenance, thus depressing, instead of raising their spirits. My daughter has not recovered the fatigue of her journey yet, I suppose." Lady Glendinning shook her head.— " Mrs. Conway," she exclaimed, " will not add to, or dimmish, my indisposition by
her just observations. I am indeed ifr\ and fear I shall not speedily recover." Lady Lenox proposed her having ad¬ vice, which she positively declined. Eleanor had attentively scrutinized her face; she did indeed look ill, but the ex¬ pressive pensiveness which beamed in her eyes convinced her that her mind was ill at^ease, -and that she was evidently un¬ happy, though for what cause she could not exactly ascertain. Yet, notwithstand¬ ing her treatment to her on many occa¬ sions, she felt inclined to pity her. She had been kind to her in the present in¬ stance, and she was grateful for it. Mrs. Conway now begged Eleanor would attend her, as dinner would be ready by the time they should reach Cam¬ berwell, and Mr. Conway would be ex¬ pecting her. Eleanor therefore took leave of all pre¬ sent. Lady Glendinning shook her hand with great kindness, and wished her much pleasure in her visit.
Lord Montalban, in extreme vexation, faltered out an adieu; while Mrs. Con¬ way brightened his countenance, by ex¬ pressing her hopes that he would often visit her,, as likewise Georgina and Ro¬ bert. All promised to comply, and Mrs. Con¬ way led Eleanor to her carriage. During their ride, the former lady ex¬ pressed her dislike of lady Cecilia Gray, who, she declared, had behaved herself so very ill towards Eleanor, that she could never forgive it. She likewise declared herself so happy, in being allowed to have her entirely at her house, and evinced so much' good nature towards her, that Elea¬ nor really congratulated herself on being about to reside with her, for though she could not but feel diicress at parting with ford Montalban, yet she considered it>„ under all circumstances, the most advis¬ able plan, She was aware that he had promised to unite himself to* Georgina, and by being in his- presence she was only
feeding a passion 'which she considered must end in absolute misery. These thoughts now passed in quick succession in her mind, and rendered her pensive. * Mrs. Conway, with much good humour, tried to disperse her gloom, and the car¬ riage now turning up the beautiful Grove of Camberwell, Mrs. Conway pointed out her cottage. Eleanor was delighted with the situa¬ tion, and was still further pleased on enter¬ ing the house, which, though denominated a cottage, was fitted up in a style that would have graced a palace. Mr. Conway met them in the hall. He had beheld Eleanor from the drawing- room window, and hastened to receive her. He welcomed her to his house, and with the most graceful manners expressed his 1 pleasure at seeing her in Lcndon.— * I shall never forget," he cried,«' that >ou were our kind conductress to the house of lord Arthur, when we were so distressed
with our unfortunate accident, as we then- considered it; but I have ever since deem¬ ed it as the most fortunate circumstance that could have occurred, as it has given' to Mrs. Conway so lovely a friend. 1 ' Eleanor smiled, as he "proceeded to ex¬ press his hopes that she would honour them with her company while in London. Mrs. Conway interrupted him, by in¬ forming him of her intended stay, which he heard with unfeigned pleasure. As the hour of dinner was approaching, Mrs. Conway hastened to her dressing- room, and invited Eleanor to accompany her, and leading her to a room adjoining, begged her to consider it as her own. The beauty of the prospect, and the simple elegance of the apartment, all con¬ spired to delight Eleanor, and added to the kind behaviour of Mrs. Conway, she fancied herself in a paradise. She looked around her, and felt she could breathe in J peace. She here met no eyes turned upon her with scorn or impertinent scrutiny,
and she already congratulated herself on' her change of residence. Mrs. Conway leaving her for a few mi¬ nutes to > alter her dress, she took a view of her new abode. The apartment was* fitted up similar to Mrs. Conway's dress¬ ing-room; its prevailing colour was a deli¬ cate pink, which matched with the furni¬ ture. The curtains were beautifully cover¬ ed with white muslin, tastefully arranged. At one window ran a honeysuckle, which twined its branches round the frame, and gave a delightful perfume to the room. At the other window ran a grape vine, which already promised a luxurious pro¬ duce of its delicious fruit. Eleanor felt a ray of delight steal over her bosom, which she had not experienced since her departure from Scotland. In this sweet retirement she fancied she should at least pass her time in peace and content, and she wished that lord Arthur .could know of her destination, asr she fan¬ cied he would be more easy if he knew of her present abode. She continued buried
in her own. reflections until Mrs/ Conway summoned her to the dinner-table *,' and on • entering the parlour,, she beheld a gentle¬ man, who was introduced to her as Mr. Reynolds, the father of Mrs. Conway. - He expressed himself much pleased tot the opportunity of seeing a young lady, of whom, he added, he had heard so much, and returned his-thanks to her for the kind treatment which had- been afforded - to his daughter at St. Michael's Castle. i Eleanor expressed her happiness at hav¬ ing been instrumental to their, relief, for which, she added, she was already mow; than paid, in the kind attention of Mr. and Mrs. Conway; and she asserted, with truth, that she should experience far greater pleasure in residing with them than in St. James's-square. v Mrs. Conway felt highly gratified at this preference given to her; and it would be doing her great injustice, if we did not add, that she really displayed towards Eleanor the warmest affection; and the good nature of her disposition hid, in a
great measure, the defects of her under¬ standing. On dinner being over, Mrs. Conway and Eleanor arose; and as the evening was lovely, the former proposed to shew her the adjacent scenery. Eleanor readily acquiesced, and they set out for a short walk. The beauties of that delightful spot are doubtless known to most of my readers too well -to need a description; suffice it to say, Eleanor was delighted,at the lovely prospect which surrounded her. On reaching the top of jfche Grove, her admiration increased, and she expressed herself in terms of pleasure. Mrs. Conway replied, that it was in¬ deed a sweet place, and what rendered it still more agreeable was, that a number of genteel persons resided in its vicinity, al¬ though she had not yet formed an ac¬ quaintance with many; yet, she added, it was certainly more pleasant to be sur¬ rounded with people who were really genteel, than to have her sight annoyed with the motley group of the city*
She informed Eleanor tliat Mr. Con- way regularly attended Lincoln's Inn every morning, which greatly pleased her father, who "was now quite reconciled to their union, and that nothing could ex¬ ceed their mutual happiness. Eleanor congratulated her on her fe¬ licity, which she hoped might be perma¬ nent, and complimented her on her taste; and added, that she had made good the assertion of Thomson, who beautifully expresses his sentiments on the marriage state, in the following lines :— " Happy they, the happiest of their kind", Whom jjentler stars unite, and in one fate Their.pcrsoni*, being, and their fortunes blend/ 1 ' Mrs. Conway smiled.—" You are quite a poet," she exclaimed; "but I suppose you have read a great deal." "I have been in the habit, madam," replied Eleanor, " of studying those au¬ thors whose works are most calculated to the improvement of the mindj and which have been recommended to me by lord
Arthur, on whose judgment I have ever placed the most implicit reliance." Mrs. Conway owned she had not read much, owing to her having been brought up with her uncle, to whose business she had so closely attended. She added her regrets on the occasion; but informed Eleanor, that now she was her guest, they would together read all those works which Eleanor deemed most worthy of notice. Eleanor replied, that she should be hap¬ py to contribute to her amusement in any way she thought proper; and having now rambled as far as they wished, they re¬ turned homewards. In passing through the Grove, Eleanor observed the park and lodge leading to a noble mansion, and expressed her admira¬ tion of its construction. *« Ah," replied Mrs. Conway, "it is now only the remains of taste and splendour. That seat once belonged to the late cele¬ brated doctor L------, who distinguished himself for so many years in his profes¬ sional skill, and whose judgment as a-
physician can only be excelled by the humanity*, of his character, which was displayed to numbers of his fellow-crea¬ tures." " I have heard of him," replied Eleanor; " but I must confess your panegyric is the warmest which ever met my ears." " Perhaps so," replied Mrs. Conway; " it would be difficult to find that being, 1 believe, who could meet with general approbation; but as you set me the ex¬ ample just now of quoting, I shall follow it, by repeating some lines which I re¬ member reading somewhere, and I think applicable to the present subject— " Men's evils wo write in brass, Ihcir viitties in water." " Most excellent, as well as applicable, madam," returned Eleanor, " and from the pen of an author whose fame I trust will never die — the immortal Shake¬ speare." « I thank you," replied Mrs. Conway, " for your information. I can already see
what a source of amusement you have in store for me, by your thorough knowledge of all our best poets." ■ She paused, as they had now reached their own door, and on entering the draw¬ ing-room, found, their party increased, by the addition of sir Henry Conway and his son, who had taken a ride to Camberwell, as was their frequent custom. A fresh introduction of Eleanor took place, and both sir Henry and his son manifested their pleasure at seeing her. In the former she beheld the real gentle¬ man, whose whole appearance was pre¬ possessing to the extreme, his years sitting on him rather as an ornament than a bur¬ then. Mr. Conway was a fine-looking young man, lively and spirited to the extreme, and' his conversation was a source of amusement to all. He frequently ad¬ dressed himself'to Eleanor; and all present paid her so much attention, that if it had not been for painful ideas which crowded
on her mind, she would have fancied her¬ self happy. The evening passed on with great plea¬ sure, and before the departure of sir Hen¬ ry, he inquired of Eleanor the residence of lady Glendinning, as he wished to pay his respects to her, in order to return his personal thanks to her and lord Arthur, for their friendly interference to him in favour of his nephew. Eleanor informed him of lier residence with lady Cecilia, and with his son and Mr. Reynolds departed for town. At an early hour Eleanor retired to her room. She again viewed the lovely pros¬ pect from her window; a peaceful calm¬ ness reigned around, which seemed con¬ genial to her feelings. She raised a prayer of thankfulness to that Power who had <niided her steps to an haven of content. —.« Why need I fear," she exclaimed, " the frowns of fortune ? why dread the world's contumely, since there is One in whom I trust—
, 0h t thoi^ great arbiter oflife and death, I trust in thee, and know in whom I trust; Or life or death is equal—neither weighs, All weight in this. Oh, let me live to thee. YOUKG.

The slumbers of Eleanor were awakened in the morning by the choruses of the feathered songsters, whose melodious notes stole in lengthened tones on the ear. She arose, after having enjoyed a night of calm repose, and felt herself refreshed, and her mind somewhat easier than it had been for a long while; she felt she was in a house where her comforts would be studied, VOL. II. L
and that it would be her own fault if she did not make herself comfortable. The morning was lovely, and all nature seemed to smile around. She opened one of the windows, and looking out, beheld the most lovely flower-garden in full bloom. Plants of every description were arranged in full perfection, and emitted their fragrance around. Eleanor, much pleased with the pros¬ pect, remained at the window. The scene before her fully reminded her of the beau¬ tiful description given by Thomson of the flower-garden, and she repeated aloud— «' Hail, Source ofHeing!

At length, recollecting that the hour of breakfast was near, she rung her bell, which was answered by Mrs. Conway's own maid, who informed her that her
lady had already entered .the-breakfast-. room. ! , ' .*. i - Eleanor .therefore hastened down, and found Mr. and Mrs. Conway waiting for lier. . She apologized for keeping-them, adding, it was not on account of her hav¬ ing slept so kite, but that she. had been so delighted with the prospect of their beau¬ tiful garden, that she could have remained all day gazing on it. > ' - / Mrs. Conway assured her that she had not kept them waiting, and once more begged her to consider herself as quite at home, and under no restraint Mr. Conway paid her the compliments of the morning, and congratulated her on her healthy appearance, alleging that he thought the air of Camber well had already added to the roses in her cheek. Mrs. Conway expressed herself of the same opinion, as she seated herself, in order to do the honours of her table. Eleanor was much pleased to see ,the harmony which ,really subsisted between L^
theni, 'andlmubh it redounded^ tb the credit of Mr. Conway, who, since his union with, his- lady, had certainly endeavoured tQf repajTiher kindness towards, him, by, tke;nlpst .grateful:attention on his*part.— " Ife were well/ 7 -thought Eleanor, " if all , marriages-were productive of such felicity, as, an union under such circumstances as theirs often • proves a* source of misery." < But Mr. Conway had. wisely reconciled- himself! to the trivial failings of his wife, which arose simply from education;- he remembered-that she had been the instru¬ mental cause of saving him from ruin; as such, she demanded his gratitude, and fr/aim that 1 feeling, affection actually had arisen. < Mrs/Conway, who had married-solely from motives' of tenderness, was of course happy in his love, and not a thought arose to i disturb her tranquillity. Eleanor gazed on their countenances, which evinced such peifect content, and she- mentally J drew comparisons between their and her own situation. A sigh es-
, caped heriipsi; she endeavoured:to repress it, and raising her eyes^ beheld those of Mr. Conway attehtively^fixed- on! her; nor •did he (withdraw, them;!but seeing! that she observed* him, he cried-—".I; beg your .pardon, Miss Qlendinning-^I fear you will think me guilty of great rudeness, in put¬ ting your modesty to" the -blushJby my jgaze; ■ but your features, so forcibly remind me of a lady, a friend of ;ours, thatt J .can¬ not but speak i;of the ^wonderful 'resem- jblance.,; :Ypu .were.t.apparently; in - *deep . thought just thenV :which, jif possible,;add- ; ed to; the likeness you;bear to ?her,, as she possesses *a wonderful "firmness; of; counte¬ nance,; /and : I. rhaveoften seen her almost .lost in; thought^; ;and only that L seev,so : youthful 'a form before me, I could really r'suppose; it was the same being.":; '■*..■ ■";'■•.:'..• : r " To whom do; you :allude, my dear?" ^inquired Mrs. Conway. .

'Why any body might take you to be her daughter* Eleanor." ",< Indeed, madam," 1 she replied, in a voice of'agitation, occasioned hy this sud¬ den ^declaration; while Mr. Conway, ob¬ serving her emotion, exclaimed—"• Really we ought to beg your pardon, Miss'Glen- dinning, for this investigation of your fea¬ tures ; but I trust you will excuse it, and be assured, that Mrs. Clifford, the \&\y to whom we allude, is a woman of the most exemplary character, as a wife and mother, and whose noble demeanor and beauty of person can only be excelled by the good¬ ness of her disposition. Need I say she has only to be seen to be admired ? * and I am proud to assert she adds to the num¬ ber of our truly-valuable friends." >. , > " Yes 1 ," exclaimed Mrs. Conway,. " she is certainly a most genteel woman, and all
the family are particularly agreeable; and I am sure you must allow that Miss Clif¬ ford, their eldest daughter, is a most lovely young lady. I am sure Eleanor would like her, and I shall be happy," she con¬ tinued, addressing Eleanor, " to introduce you to them." " I should feel much obliged by the in¬ troduction, madam," replied Eleanor, " as of course the friendship of such an amiable family must be an acquisition; and I must own I feel some degree of interest to be¬ hold a lady who you say I so much re¬ semble." ' " You 1 are certainly very like her," re¬ turned Mrs. Conway, " and the more I look at you, the more I see it; but you shall judge for yourself, for we will take a ride this morning, and call upon them, if it will be agreeable to you." " Certainly, madam," replied Eleanor, " if will afford me the highest pleasure, if it suits your convenience." ' " Perfectly so," she cried. " I mean to devote 'my time for your amusement,
while you remain my guest, and I hope I shall be able to afford you as much plea¬ sure as your society gives to me." Eleanor thanked her, and Mr. Conway now rising, prepared to go to tov^n. His groom was in waiting with his horse at the door, and wishing them good-morn- in,g, Mr. Conway rode off. " Does Mr. Conway always ride to town on horseback, madam?" inquired Eleanor. Mrs. Conway replied that he did, being very fond of that exercise, and that the carriage was always then in readiness for her;-" bnt I often wish," she continued, " that I could sit a horse. I think I should like it much. I often envy a lady who I frequently see, though I don't know who she is, but she very often passes here on horseback, always attended by a groom, and sometimes I have seen two servants with lier. She is, I think, one of the most genteel-looking figures I ever saw, and sits her horse with so much grace, that I always take a pleasure in looking at her

spoke of< the virtues and accomplishments of this family, adding, they had been in¬ troduced to her by sir Henry Conway, who was acquainted with Mr. Clifford, and 'that she had found herself much pleased^with them*; for though, she add¬ ed, she had not'said much respecting Mr. Clifford, yet she thought him no way in¬ ferior to his lady, as- his person was hand¬ some, and his manneis elegant and fasci¬ nating, 5 and a more congenial pair there could scarcely be found. Their house, she said, was the abode of harmony ; they kept out little company, as their own family circle appeared to constitute their happiness. < Eleanor expressed her admiration of such a picture, and much longed to be¬ hold them, particularly Mrs. Clifford, whom Mrs. Conway said she so 'greatly resembled; and on that lady pointing out to her notice an elegant house, and affirm¬ ing it to be theirs, she felt herself un¬ usually agitated, and she trembled as she
descended from the carriage, and entered the house. > , * > > The servant led the way to the draw¬ ing-room, -where sat Mrs. and Miss Clif¬ ford, as: also some of her younger daugh¬ ters. They arose on the entrance of Mrs. Conway, and expressed their pleasure at seeing her, / while Mrs. Clifford, turning her eyes full on Eleanor, appeared struck with her presence. * Mrs. Conway immediately informed them, that'having the pleasure of a young friend's company, who was from Scot¬ land, she could not resist the pleasure of introducing her. Mrs, Clifford immediately advanced to¬ wards Eleanor, and in the most affable manner welcomed her to her house; but on Mrs. Conway's pronouncing the name of Miss Glendinning, she hastily seized her hand, the* colour fled from her cheeks, and she appeared almost incapable of speechj «L Eleanor -looked on her with astonish¬ ment, i In her face and figure she beheld
all that Mrs. Conway had described ■; and she felt, she knew not why, peculiarly in¬ terested in her fate: she was herself hard¬ ly less agitated than Mrs. Clifford, who pressed her hand still between hers, with a warmth that bespoke a feeling ibeyond that of an acquaintance. Miss Clifford saw the emotion of i her mother, and advancing towards her, ten¬ derly inquired if she felt herself indis¬ posed? f i ; " Rather so, my dear Emily," she re¬ plied ; " a sudden faintness stole over me, but I am better now."' She endeavoured to smile, and turning again to Eleanor, cried—" I hope, Miss Glendinning, you will not impute this weakness to a want of respect or pleasure I feel at the honour you have done me by your visit, as it will afford me the highest satisfaction in being favoured with your society as often as possible." " So far from imputing your behaviour to a wrong cause, madam," replied Elea¬ nor, " I -feel highly gratified'shy .your
warm reception of me, which bespoke a sentiment far beyond what I could have hoped to find in a lady who till >now' was a stranger to me; but if you will grant me your friendship, I shall prize it as an inestimable gift." Mrs. Clifford .gracefully assured her she already possessed it to the highest degree, and tlie expression of her countenance crave evident proof of -her assertion, as she continued to gaze on her with looks of the teriderest regard ; when Mrs. Conway turning to her, suddenly exclaimed— " You have heaid me say, JVIrs. Clifford, what extremely kind and genteel 'beha¬ viour Mr. Conway and I met with when in Scotland 'from lord Arthur Glendin- nine\ from whose interference indeed I may say I owe my present happiness." j "'I'have often heard you mention it," replied*Mrs. Clifford ; " and in you, Miss Glendinning," she continued, addressing Eleanor, .'f I presume I behold lord Ar~ thurlS'dauglUei*." >J >* The cheeks of Eleanor assumed a crim-
son blush at this question. - Her lips mov¬ ed, - but no sound issued. ' ■ ; < Mrs. Conway saw her embarrassment] and wishing to relieve her, replied—" Oh, no, madam, his niece Eleanor is the daughter of his sister lady Frances, who, I understand, has withdrawn herself from her family." • > . »" The daughter of lady Frances!" re¬ peated Mrs. Clifford, in a voice of extreme agitation, ".impossible! AVho'can have asserted such,.an erroneous report?", - i . " Really I don't know, ma'am," replied Mrs. Conway, staring at her with astonish¬ ment, while Eleanor, , greatly agitated, fixed a look of inquiry on her, which Mrs. Clifford observing, exclaimed--" I beg your pardon, Miss Glendinning, but your great resemblance to lord Arthur led me to suppose that you claimed a nearer tic of j relationship to him than that-of a niece." ( . , > i t ,i ."Are you acquainted u then, , madam, with lord Arthur?" quickly -inquired Eleanor. .' •> > , i o '* .oo;.!
.1 Mrs. Clifford looked confused.—"I for¬ merly knew lord Arthur," she.replied, " and have seen lady Frances Glendin¬ ning, but it is now many years- since' she has withdrawn herself from the world; and depend upon it, from what little I knew of her, she never could or would have been separated from her child. Yet, perhaps, it is cruel in me thus to remove the veil which is thrown over your eyes respecting your birth; yet rest assured, you are a near descendant of lord Arthur; but, however high your rank, it cannot raise the regard I feel for you ; and I have only to request you will excuse the appa¬ rent rudeness of which I have been guilty in thus criticising your countenance." < " 'Tis something strange,"* cried Mrs. Conway, " for it was only this morning at breakfast' that Mr. Conway -was notic¬ ing the remarkable likeness' which Miss Glendinning bears to you, madam, and which is indeed very striking." Mrs. Clifford endeavoured to smile off this assertion,, but the ^alternate' pale and
Ted Which varied on her cheek bespoke an inward emotion which she endeavoured to conceal. Eleanor marked her visible agitation with wonder: the conduct of Mrs. Clif- "ford had filled- her with surprise. -She felt, she knew not why, unaccountably drawn towards her. The ties of affection even appeared to interweave themselves .around her heart, and she scarce knew how to reply to the questions she asked. Mrs. Clifford, however, dropped the subject entirely, which Eleanor by no • means wished to renew, and the conver¬ sation became more general; though airs. Clifford still contrived to make a few in¬ quiries as to the family Of lord Arthur, and whether earl Campbell was still living; and on Eleanor replying in the affirma¬ tive, a smile of dignified satisfaction stole over her lovely countenance. If Eleanor was pleased with Mrs. Clif¬ ford, she was no less delighted with her fascinating daughter:* in'Emily-Clifford she beheld all .that could please the eye,
or gain upon the heart: her disposition appeared as amiable as her manners were gentle and irresistible; and Eleanor fan- cied in her a mind congenial to her own. During their stay, Mr. Clifford entered the drawing-room, when his lady ladvanc- ing towards him, introduced Eleanor as Miss Glendinning. Eleanor thought he cast a look of ini¬ quity on her, but instantly collecting himself, he welcomed-her in the most cor¬ dial terms, and expressed Jiis .pleasure at seeing her. Fleanor was flmieh prepossessed by ihis appearance. ,H f e was rather in the mid¬ dle age oflife, but his person still agree¬ able, and retaining the activity of youth. Miss Clifford, she saw, 'resembled iher father, and not Mrs. Clifford, which was accounted for by ^ the intelligence which she heard during their visit. Emily Clif¬ ford was the offspring of a former mar¬ riage, as Mr. Clifford had twice entered the nuptial state; but so great an harmony subsisted in^this amiable family, that Mis.
Clifford regarded not her own children more than the lovely Emily, who, in re¬ turn, loved her with the sincerest affection, and looked up to her as a mother, as her own she never remembered. - The time flew on so imperceptibly that Mrs. Conway looked at her watch in some surprise, as she found the morning fast advancing, and in consequence arose. Mrs. Clifford appeared loth to part with Eleanor, and begged she would favour her with her company at all possible op¬ portunities. Mrs. Conway good-humouredly remind¬ ed her that she would always > find Miss Glendinning at her cottage, whenever she chose to honour her with her visits ,* and it was likewise agreed, that Miss Clifford should spend the following day with them at Camber well Grove—a propo¬ sition which Eleanor heard with great de¬ light, as she felt much inclined to culti¬ vate this young lady's friendship. j . On taking their leave, Mrs. Clifford again pressed the hand of Eleanor with so
much warmth, that she felt more and more surprised, and on entering the carriage with Mrs. Conway, she expressed her ad¬ miration of her in the highest degree.— " I thought you would like her," she re¬ plied ; " every body admires her that has the pleasure of her acquaintance." This assertion was readily believed by Eleanor, who felt not only a sentiment of admiration, but that of affection, which even at this early period the amiable Mrs. Clifford had raised in her bosom ; nor did she anticipate scarcely less pleasure in the idea of cultivating the esteem of the fasci¬ nating Emily, and she congratulated her¬ self on the prospect of passing her time so agreeably while under the roof of Mrs. Conway, and being removed from the haughty lady Cecilia Gray; though her thoughts continually wandered to St. James's-square. Lord Montalban was-a resident there: doubtless he would now fulfil his promise, and comply with the wishes of his family. The thought cost her a pang. She sighed deeply.
>Mrs. Conway looked earnestly at her, and half-jestingly inquired the cause of her regret. Eleanor evaded the question, and the carriage now driving up the Grove, they were instantly set down at their own door, and they soon separated to dress for dinner. When alone, Eleanor again reflected on the behaviour of Mrs. Clifford, which, though kind in the extreme, was certainly mysterious, and something strange, in ia lady who till mow had been a perfect ^stranger.—*• How,"'thought Eleanor," can Mrs. Clifford doubt !my -being the child of lady Francesi? Alas! what strange emo¬ tions she raised dn this aching heart! Oh, my mother 1' she mentally ejaculated, " when shall we meet ? when shall I be restored to the embraces of a parent? Sin¬ gular fate is mine : Mrs. Clifford viewed me as the daughter of lord Arthur. Oh I she knew not the feelings that supposition raised in my bosom! How painful is concealment to an ingenuous mind! yet
it must be so. I am the child of myste¬ ry: a veil obscures my birth, and until fate shall tear it away, I must remain to the world, as I truly am, the daughter of Adversity and the victim of Suspicion."
CHAPTER XII.
With aspect mild and elevated eye, Iiehold him sauted on n mount serrnc, Above the foj.-s uf sense and pasiion's storm ; All the black cares and tumults of this life, Like harmless thunders, breaking nt his feet, Excite his pity, not impair his pence. YorKo. Iiis nature is too n»b!c fur tlie world j lie would not flatter Neptune for his trident, Or Jove for his power to thunder; his heart's his mouth. What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent. SlIAKTSl'LAIlE. Eleanor remained in her own room un¬ til Mrs. Conway joined her. She inform¬ ed her that Mr. Conway was returned home, and waiting for them in the dining- parlour. She likewise added, that he had a gentleman with him, who she believed he had prevailed on to stay dinner.— " I don't know though," she continued, " whether we shall find him an agreeable
acquisition or not: 'tis according as his humour prevails." • / " Is he so very changeable a being, ma¬ dam, then ?" inquired Eleanor, as a smile dimpled on her cheek ; " I should think the mode of conduct tb constitute a gen¬ tleman is that of always possessing the same agreeable suavity of manners and temper, particularly when in the house of a friend: but perhaps this gentleman is one of our fashionable beaux, who are scarcely the same being two hours to¬ gether, and whose temper and whole de¬ portment are the slaves to caprice of the present moment." " Mercy on me," replied Mrs. Conway, laughing very heartily; " why, what a mistake you are making, my dear! this is an old gentleman, I dare say seventy years of age. Did you think you were going to be introduced to one of our young beaux ? if so, you will be greatly disappointed, for I promise you this Mr. Crosby is one of the severest old beings ever breathing: he is almost sure to of-
fend me by telling me his mind too plainly. Why, do you 1 know he has the audacity to tell me of my faults, as lie terms them, to my face; and yet you will think me very strange, when I say I am hardly ever affronted with him, for ho looks so venerable, and possesses, I know, a good heart at the bottom, that I gene¬ rally look over his rudeness; though it is not at all times pleasant; but Mr. Con¬ way values his friendship, therefore I al¬ ways behave civil to him." " It is a proof of your good sense, ma¬ dam," replied Eleanor, " to pay such im¬ plicit reliance on Mr. Conway's judg¬ ment ; and, by what you say of this Mr. Crosby, I suppose he is like a rough dia¬ mond, which wants but the outward po¬ lish of art to set forth its intrinsic worth."' " Perhaps so," icturned Mrs. Conway; " but you will be able to judge for your¬ self presently." She then left the room, requesting Eleanor to follow her as soon as she was attired, with which she in a very short
time complied, and on entering the par¬ lour she saw a gentleman conversing with Mr. Conway: his voice seemed mild and prepossessing, but before she could see his face, Mrs. Conway exclaimed—-" Come, Eleanor, we are waiting your presence:. give me leave to introduce you to Mr. Crosby." On hearing this speech the stranger turned round: a sound, almost resembling a stifled groan, burst from his lips as he - sank extremely agitated on a chair, from which he had just risen. On entering the room, Eleanor had dropped a graceful curtsey, but much astonished at his sudden behaviour, she advanced nearer towards him, while Mr. and Mrs. Conway, also greatly surprised, inquired if he was taken ill? For a few moments he made no reply, when, as if not regarding their question, he exclaimed—" Tell me who is that young lady ?" "That is Miss Glendinning," replied vol. n. m
Mrs. Conway, " the niece of lord Arthur Glendinning, with whose family we have the honour of being acquainted, and who has done me the pleasure of paying me a visit in London." " Miss Glendinning!" he re-echoed, while a deep sigh escaped his bosom: •" the name is unknown to me." Mrs. Conway again inquired as to his health, while Eleanor stood gazing in speechless wonder at the venerable form be¬ fore 1 her. He appeared, as Mrs. Conway had asserted, as much as seventy years of age; his figure and face extremely prepossessing. It was in vain Eleanor looked in his coun¬ tenance for those traits of severity and crossness which Mrs. Conway had describ¬ ed ; his features wore the stamp* of bene¬ volence, and the furrows of age which stole over his face, and the silver white¬ ness of his hair, combined to render him an object at once interesting and pleasing. He appeared to be now recovering, and on Mr. Conway pressing him 1 to take a glass of wine, or some restorative, he re-
plied in the negative.—" 'Tis not wine," he cried, " can remove a constitutional complaint, though I thank you for your offer. Tis here," he cried, " my pain lies," placing his hand to his heart; " 'tis here I am afflicted." He then fixed his eyes on Eleanor, who stood terrified and trembling.—" I fear, young 1 lady," he cried, " I must have alarmed you; but you must excuse the infirmities of age. I know," he added, relapsing into a tone of severity, " I have done enough to frighten the nerves of our modern young ladies of fashion into hys¬ terics, who would be absolutely terrified to death, as they so falsely term it, by the attacks of an old man," Eleanor scarce knew how to reply; she felt much inclined to possess herself of his good opinion. With a look of softness, and a gentle tone, she replied—" But I am not a young lady of fashion, sir; 'tis a word only known to me by name ; I am not its votary: nature, pure, and unac* w 3
companied by art, is my deity; that has ever taught mc, I trust, compassion for the woes of another; and believe me, sir, although a stranger, your sudden illness has caused me the greatest concern; per¬ mit me to offer you my hopes that you feel yourself recovering." Mr. Crosby took her hand.—" You ap¬ pear an angel," he cried, in a tone of warmth, though strongly marked by agi¬ tation ; " pure and unsophisticated nature seems indeed your guide; may you con¬ tinue such!" " Astonishing !" cried Mrs. Conway; " can this be Mr. Crosby ? are you turned flatterer at last ?" " No, madam," he replied, " but if you are surprised at my using such language, it is in consequence of your never having seen me in the presence of any who me¬ rited my encomiums, not because I am incapable of rightly appreciating merit." " With the exception, sir, of Mrs. Clif¬ ford and her daughter," said Mrs. Con-
way; " they are, I believe, favourites of yours." " They are, and deservedly so," here- plied ; " but I feel myself too ill for con¬ versation now. You must excuse my making a longer stay." As dinner was now being placed on the table, Mr. Conway insisted that he should not depart until he dined, as he originally intended. He kept refusing till Mr. Con¬ way, smiling and addressing Eleanor, begged, as she was already so great a fa* vouritc with Mr. Crosby, that she would add her entreaties. " With pleasure, sir," she replied, at the same time, in a voice of kind persua¬ sion, begged he would favour them with his company. Mr. Crosby regarded her with marked expression.—" How few there are," he cried, " of your age, who would thus in¬ terest themselves for an old man like me! I feel I cannot refuse you any thing, yet you must grant me one favour in return." * " With pleasure, sir," she replied ;
" teach me how to comply with your desires; name your wishes, and, if pos¬ sible, they shall be complied with on my part." • t " Your name, I think, is Eleanor: is it not ?" he inquired. " Mrs. Conway called you so." " It is, sir," she replied; when he again taking her hand, looked at her tenderly in the face. A -tear dropped from his aged eyes: she felt the precious gem upon her arm: her own feelings gave vent, and a reciprocal tear forced its way down her check. He observed it.—" Do you weep for mc ?" he exclaimed; " angel of pity i may thy tears ever flow from her dictates, unaccompanied by self-conviction or guilt J Yet," he continued, " Innocence itself is not safe—Vice hovers near: she raises her towering plumage aroimd, and envi¬ ous of her superior competitor, spreads her temptations over the young and un¬ wary ; few can withstand her fascinating allurements; they grasp at her invitations —they become her votaries—they fall—
they sink! Yes,/innocent as thou art* this may be thy fate. Destruction may crop another flower! I once■ was. in pos¬ session of one as lovely, yet she fell like a blighted rose, and by the rude' hand of man was thrown disregarded to her parent dust, never more to rise!" Eleanor gazed on his agonized counte¬ nance with wonder and concern, while Mrs. Conway, rather impatiently, begged them to seat themselves, as the dinner was.on table, and while Mr. Crosby raised his handkerchief to his eyes, she whisper¬ ed in the ear of Eleanor—" This is for ever the way; always, moralizing upon some dismal subject or other. He will absolutely teaze you to death, my dear." - "No, madam," replied Eleanor; "on the contrary, it will afford me much gra¬ tification to listen to his conversation. I feel much interested in him." ; . She paused, as rising from his chair, .with an effort of composure, he bowed to Mrs. Conway, exclaiming— i( I beg your
et.eanor; pardon, madam; I will no longer detain you-from your dinner/' - . " * • 4 ' " But your request, sir??' said Eleanor; '* You 'have not told me in what I can oblige you." s n ( " By permitting me the privilege of conversing with you as an old friend," he replied, " and," continued he, in a voice of tremulous emotion, "by suffering me to call you by'the appellation of Eleanor i 'tis a name deeply engraven on my heart, the recollection of which brings -agony to my soul.' r '■ '' '• • ' ^ 5 * ' ,J,U He sighed deeply,^ while ^Eleanor,' with a smile which might have graced a bloom¬ ing cherub,*exclaimed~" Is that the whole of your request, sir ?> f Most certainly 'tis granted on my part: and I shall consider it as a proof of your friendship in "thus laying aside all cold formality, and address¬ ing me only in the way you' wish." '-■ - ' Mr/ CJrdsby 1 turned a lo r 6k- j of delight \ipon her, and the little party sat down* to' the table,- and the' conversation' became
general,! but supported only "by Mr. and Mrs. Conway, and Eleanor, for Mr. Crosby remained totally silent during the meal, which,'to him, was that of a form only, as scarcely a morsel passed his lips. His eyes insensibly fixed on Eleanor, to whom he sat opposite; and Mrs. Conway twice addressed him without obtaining any an¬ swer, so deeply lost in thought was he, as to heed no question put to'him. "* Now is not this abominably rude ?" whispered Mrs. Conway. " This is the way he frequently serves me. Did I not know him to be a genteel person, I should suppose him a downright brute." Eleanor smiled a reply. She was con¬ vinced that the strange manners of Mr. Crosby arose not in consequence of inhe¬ rent rudeness, but the effects of a mind ill at esse. Whatever were the nature of his sorrows she could not tell, but that misfortune had shed her bitter drops upon him, she clearly perceived, and she regret¬ ted thai so venerable a form should carry u3
the. rankling thorn of i grief within his.bo- som.- : i . - . ' - :, • ■ <■<■ v.-"'' *. . It was not until the cloth was removed that he iraised his, eyes around,, and ad¬ dressing Eleanor, inquired if she had ever before been in London. ■-»She replied in ithe negative. , v ' •" What then could induce your friends," he cried, "to trust you in its vortex? Have you a relish for all its gaieties? and with all the ardour so natural to youth, does your heart, pant for its vain amuse¬ ments? Are you," continued he, "to be initiated and trained up to fit you to mix with the world of fashion ? Are you, I say, to be corrupted by its follies, and sa¬ crificed to its vices?" " Lord, Mr. Crosby," replied Mrs.* Con¬ way, " hour you talk! You are enough to terrify Eleanor ''by such »a picture as this; Do you suppose; sir, I am going to plunge her into suclv scenes as you de¬ scribe?" ' '• ' ■' * " Heaven knows,' madam," he returned; " you are a lover of the gay world. I be-

Conway, "what you denominate as folly Is .considered -by the generality of the world: as pleasure, after which pursuit, every,orie is busily employed." v :,-. : ^ Pleasured liei repeated \:df how. is that word^ abused!: how few^there are who know and; feel ?>5 real meaning!: Thefine lady seeks it in scenes of riot and dissipa-. tibni^The libertine and' the despoiler of
virtue in exulting over the victims of their lawless designs; the miser in counting out his hidden treasure, and secreting that which, if rightly employed, would save a fellow-creature from ruin, from want and wretchedness. Are any of these, think you, capable of appreciating the word pleasure ? Oh, no, it is self-gratification. True happiness consists in the heartfelt satisfaction of relieving the wants of our fellow-creatures; for oh! what pleasure can equal that of beholding an unhappy and distressed object rescued from misery and want by a well-timed irelief! ' What ecstacy is in the thought of saving an un¬ fortunate being from wretchedness!" " If being charitable and humane can con¬ stitute true happiness," cried Mr. Conway, " I must congratulate you, sir, on possess¬ ing it to its.fullesf extent; for the'charities of Mr.'Crosby are too well known not to be universally admired. You'there¬ fore/according to your own doctrine, must be most supremely 'happy." • - l

It was in vain ho was pressed to pro¬ long his stay. He took the hand of Elea¬ nor, and gazing tenderly on her, bade her adieu.—" I will often' see you," he cried, " if my company will not prove tedious to you; for my heart seems insensibly drawn towards you. I have not felt*so much for any one since I lost my own i-----But no matter," he continued, " why should I speak of my own sorrows ? they are past—they are ------Yes,, they shall be forgotten," he added, in a tone of forced resolution. " To grieve for calamities past- does not evince the resignation of a true Christian.

," Farewell, sir," replied Eleanor, much affected at his manners. " I will treasure up your advice, and profit, I trust, by your counsel." " We shall see you to-morrow, sir," cried Mr, Conway. " We shall have an¬ other favourite of yours here — Emily Clifford is to pass the day with us." " Then will your cottage be graced, Mr. Conway," he,replied, " by the sister hand¬ maids of Truth, Innocence and Virtue, Yes/' 1 he added, " if. those divine emana¬ tions still exist on this corrupted earth, they are to be exemplified in an Eleanor and an Emily. They shall redeem the sinking honour of their erring sex, and convince us that purity still dwells ori earth." " I hope it does," replied Mr. Conway, smiling; " at least, we ought not to doubt it, when so many of our lovely females carry the stamp in their faces." " You are a young man," returned Mr. Crosby, " and are, .therefore, deceived by
false show; but I will not dispute the point with you. Farewell! Most likely I will see you to-morrow," He then repeated his adieu to Eleanor, and bowing to Mrs. Conway, left the house.
