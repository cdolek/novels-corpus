EDRIC, THE FORESTER, 4-c %c.
CHAPTER I. In Ihc days of William the Con¬ queror, there lived a valiant youth, strongly attached to his interest His name was Edric (surnamed the Fo¬ rester). He had the good fortune of bein^ very successful in arms ; which induced the king to raise him from the station he held in his army to the rank of general, and give him tlie command of a very powerful army, with which a2
(assisted by the Wchh) ho marcned to invest Shrewsbury, jn order lo al- tack the troops of the Eari- Client, Fitzosborne, and the Baron Fitzosric ; who, vvith many oilier noblemen, con¬ tinued strongly to opp^o the iuva^i :i of William. The renown of Edric the Forever spread far and near; and ihe micccvs he had hitherto met with, evciUd (er¬ ror and alarm in the bosoms of ali those he meant to oppose. No sooner did tlie news reach the confederate Earls, that Edric was ad¬ vancing *. ith a very formidable army towards Shrewsbury, than the Baron Fitzosric hastened to his castle of St. Egbert, to see that it was in a state to
repel the attacks of the enemy. For, if Shrewsbury fell into their hands, as he much feared it would, he had not a doubt but the army would proceed im¬ mediately to St. Egbert's Castle and the valuable estates thereto belonging, as it was situated on the banks of the Severn, about six miles distant from Shrewsburv. He dreaded the victo- rious arms of the valiant Edric ; his -\ ev\ name filled his breast with an in¬ describable terror that he could no way account fbr: his bosom also glowed with an unconquerable hatred toward Edric ; for, in the many skir¬ mishes that he had met with, Edric always maintained ihe superiority over him : and he could not bear to behold >o young a champion arrive at tlic Mimmit of military excellence, bearing a 3
down the sagacity of those of double his age. And he began to think it most prudent to endeavour to make his peace with the Conqueror ; appre¬ hensive that if Edric the Forester should have the success to vanquish the Earls Brient and Fitzosborne, there would remain nothing to prevent his immediately marching to the Castle of St Egbert, and perhaps reduce that noble edifice to a pile of ruins. A few days prior to Edric the For¬ ester's determination of giving them battle at Shrewsbury, Fitzosric visited St. Egbert's Castle, on the business as before related. He liad arrived under '!k outer wall, whieh extended a considerable way, when his horse stumbled and threw him. His ser«
\ants were apprehensive that he had received some injury by the fall; there¬ fore, lifting him in Iheir arms, they conveyed him into a small cottage that stood by the way side, as the Castle was at too great a distance for them to think of carrying him there till they had examined the extent of his hurt. As soon as they had seen him safe to the cottage, one of his domestics hurried to the Castle to get a proper carriage to remove him, leaving his i3 ' Cj fellow servants to attend on their master. The cottage was inhabited by a woman and her daughter of ver\ ^en^ teel appearance, who, although habit- \*-d in Mm pie attire, had a certain somc- A I
thing in their behaviour that evinced they had seen better days. They shewed every possible attention to the gentleman, who soon recovered by their kind assistance, and gazed al¬ ternately on Ellen and Elgiva (for that were their names) in speechless .admiration. Ellen expressed a fervent hope that he was not hurt. Elgiva most tender¬ ly seconded her mother's inquiries. Fitzosric assured them hc was well, and expressed himself much obliged by their generous attention. After hav i profusely thanked them for Iheir kindness, and his carriage arriv¬ ing, he took his leave. Ellen w r as about thirty-six year,« of
age: she possessed a most engaging countenance; her form had dignity and grace equally blended ; her voice was tender and harmoniously persua¬ sive ; and she would have done honor to better apparel than that which she wore. As it was, she could not fail of attracting admiration in all who be¬ lield her. Elgiva, the daughter of Ellen, was seventeen. She was not so tall as Ellen ; but had much of her person and manner. She had beautiful au¬ burn hair, whieh flowed in artless ringlets, disdaining to be confined by the bandages she wore: her eves were a lovely blue; the serene sweet smile of gentleness always shone on her countenance, which made her mother, a5
the fair Ellen, so much regarded. But the meanness of their little habitation, and their plain attire, created a sen¬ sation of inquisitive curiosity in the bosom of the Baron Fitzosric lhat soon after yielded to a different pas¬ sion. When Fitzosric, by the assistance of his servants, arrived at St. Egbert's Castle, he began to make very parti¬ cular inquiries of his domesties if they knevv vvho were the inhabitants of the cottage, as they seemed to be new¬ comers ; for, to his recollection, hc had never seen them before. He was in¬ formed that they had lived there but a few days; and who they were, or whence they came, no one could give him «n*y information.
" I shall visit the cottage m the morning " said Lord Fitzosric : " I am anxious to learn vvho they are ; for their manners and the humble way in whicli th« i y Ihe but ill correspond." The Duron soon after retired to re^t; but he could not close his eyes fbr thinking of Ellen and Elgiva. And when a icuiporary slumber overcame him, his ureams presented to his wan¬ dering imagination the lovely cotta- gers, and he started from his slumber. His mind was so filled with the idea of them, that he could think of nothing else ; and he vvas resolved to pay them* a visit the next day. Day came, and the Baron Fitzosric was impatient till he went to the cot¬ tage, a 6.
The fair inhabitants wore an air of reserve at his entrance; but he told them he could not pass their door, after having received such singular attention and kindness from thern, without repeating his thanks. Ellen was not at all pleased with tliis \Wit ; but as it was unavoidable, she was obliged to submit, and necessitv com- pelled her to remain there a short time. Fitzosric, thinking his visit was not welcome, soon took his leave. In this interview the heart of Fitz¬ osric yielded to the potent pow er of what, among many, is usually called and mistaken for love ; for he was un¬ able to acknowledge w r hich of the two ladies had captivated him. Ellen was certainly a more suitable companion,
as he was turned of forty-three. But the innocence and vivacity of Elgiva eharmed him, and his wandering heart knew not w here to fix. However, as it w T as not Lord Fitzosric s intentions to marry, he returned home to form a scheme wherebv he trusted the two ladies would easily fall into his snares ; and then hastened to join his regiment at Shrewsbury, expecting every hour to be attacked by Edric the Forester.
CHAPTER If. The night before the battle of Shrewsbury was dark and stormy. The rain poured down in torrents, the tempestuous wind howled through the trees, the awful thunder rolled in tre¬ mendous peals, and the vivid light¬ ning proclaimed a night of terror. The army of Edric had pitched their tents near the town ; but Edric was anxious to behold once more his beloved Elgiva, and, determining to take advantage of the gloomy shade of night that encompassed every ob-
ject with more than usual darkne&s, he set forward io see her; and, perhaps, bid her and her amiable mother adieu for ever! unknowing what might be the chance of the morrow, which in all probability would decide the con¬ test between William the Conqueror and his opposers. He had found out the humble habitation they now re¬ sided in, and had escoiled them a few nights before to that place (as he vain¬ ly hoped) of safety; for their former dwelling was too near the seat of war, and, since their removal, had been re¬ duced to ashes by the enem\\ Accordingly he quitted his tent, and set out unmindful of the howling tempest or the beating rain. His only fear was, that, as- he had never seen
the place but once, he should be un¬ able to discover it, as the night wore a garb of unusual darkness, except when the lightning flashed upon the surrounding objects, Edric's heart beat with eager so¬ licitude for the fate of the fair Elgiva, who, with her mother, inhabited an humble cottage near the walls of the towering castle of the proud Baron Fitzosric, which he knew would be be¬ sieged if the Conqueror's army obtain¬ ed the victorv on the morrow ; for he who had been the principal in insti¬ gating the other lords to oppose Wil¬ liam, was the first for them to level their vengeance at. Only apprehensive for Elgiva, he
defied the warring elements, and dared to pass very near the guard of Fitz- osric's army, whose soldiers lay sunk in sleep. Illumined onlv bv the forked lightning which led him through the otherwise impenetrable darkness, he passed forward, till a flash more vivid than the rest, pointed out to bim the bumble dwelling of the lovely cot¬ tagers. And, what made his heart sink, to behold at a little distance the lofty turrets and embattled towers of St. Egbert's Castle, the noble domains of his most obdurate foe, the Baron Fitzosric. With what joy was he received by Ellen and Elgiva; but their joy was soon damped by the dreadful appre* hension, that this in all probability
might be the last time Heaven might bless them with a sight of each other. Their interview was short, for Edric was obliged to return as swift as possi¬ ble to the camp, to prepare for the contest of the ensuing day; and he had several miles to travel. Yet a secret grief swelled bis full heart with the idea that they might never meet again; that some ill-fated accident might intervene to cross his wishes. Elghi saw his depression ; it was so extreme, that hi all her life she had never beheld him appear lo suffer so acutely ; and, to rai*e his drooping spirits, she exerted her own, urging him to prepare for ihe approach of the ensuing day with that courage she had always seen him exert, and con¬ cluded with saying, "My Edric, will
you not strive to be happy, and hope to live for me V The question had the desired effect. To live for Elgiva was all his wish ; his bosom was animated with every hope of conquest, happiness, and love; all seemed to feel new inspiration by Elgiva's question, asking if he wmdd live for her. He tenderly embraced them, pro¬ mising that within three days, if he was alive, he would come to remove them to a more suitable habitation ; far he hoped from the tumult of war; and then departed, loaded with their blessings. He eagerly pursued his way back
to the camp; where, as soon as he arrived, he threw himself on a couch without undressing, being greatly fa¬ tigued and in want of a few hours re¬ freshment by sleep, previous to the mighty business which was to take place on the morrow. As the narration of the cottagers is at present the most material, I shall return to them : Ellen and her daughter could not prevail on themselves to retire to rest, after the departure of their beloved Edric ; but they continued during the night fervently offering up their prayers to heaven for his preservation. During the day when they knew the battle had commenced, and therebv to them was * «.
a day of dreadful anxiety, still hope animated each bosom, that Edric might yet continue the favoured object of heaven. The dav had nearlv closed, and the sun just setting in beauteous ma- iesty, as if unconscious of the horrors of the day: Ellen and Elgiva were watching with admiration and anxiety its career, as he sunk behind the hills, w hen they were suddenly alarmed by the appearance of Lord Fitzosric and a train of his attendants, pursued by a party of soldiers, with whom they were fighting and endeavouring to escape. The Baron leaped frora his horse and rushed into the cottage, followed
by three servants; and, in a tone of dismav, softened bv a wish to serve the inhabitants, thus to their astonishment exclaimed : " Shrewsbury is taken ! all is lost! the victorious army pursue us and sweep down all before them ! ily to the Castle of St. Egbert, there you shall be protected, every danger threatens you if you remain here!" " I fear no danger, my Lord!" re¬ plied Ellen; " our poverty will be our security, and sure they will not be so inhuman as to take our lives !" " Trust not to that!" replied the Baron, " but believe me your friend: apprehensive for your safety, I only
wish to place you beyond the reach of danger ; that place can only be found in the embattled Castle of St. Egbert." A servant now entered with every appearance of fright pourtrayed on his features, exclaiming, "Fly! fly 1 my Lord, we are strongly pursued ! a fresh party advances, they set fire to every house they come to, nor will they spare even this humble cottage. They are without a leader, only the soldiers Hushed with success who have taken Shrewsbury.—alas! too easily." " Oh I my beloved Edric !" cried Elgiva, in a voice of unutterable dis¬ tress, " where are you ?" and fell senseless on the ground*
Ellen was nearly frantic at the siolit: and in this situation »ome of the attendants lifted up Elgiva in their armSj and carried her in her swoon to¬ ward the castle; others seized Ellen and forced her away. Fitzosric and the remainder of his party continued fiVhting with the soldiers; and re¬ treating till they reached near the gates of St. Egbert's Castle, which stood open to receive him, and, after their entrance, closed with a heavy noise. They conveyed Elleu and Elgiva through several apartments, till they reached one very handsome on the second landing, where Elgiva, when she recovered, found herself with her mother, surrounded by the Baron Fitzosric and his party.
Ellen was extremely hurt to think of being torn from her humble cottage, but thought it best to return her thanks to Fitzosric for his kindness in wish¬ ing to protect them from danger; though in her own breast she did not fear anv ; nor had she at that time any suspicion that the Baron had only endeavoured to terrify them in order to gratify his own views. lie urged her to accept of that apartment while she and her daughter staid Jicre; and assured them that his servants would be happy to obey their commands; and after receiving thsir thanks, he withdrew'. As soon as they weve alone, Ellen said, " My dear girl, 1 could have vou i. b
spared the kindness of the Baron Fitz¬ osric, for I really had no fear; but while vve are against ourwilK indebl- cd to him for his protection, whieh i hope will not be long, we mu>t not seem unthankful; if wc reallv are in danger, we ought to be grateful to Heaven for its preservation—yet 1 hke it not." " Nor 1," replied Elgi\a, weep¬ ing: "prophetic were the apprehen¬ sions of our dear Ed rit;, lhat some accident might happen to us—where now will he seek us? he wiil never imagine that we are within the walls of St. Egbert's Castle, under the pro¬ tection of his enemy!—Fitzosric was alwavs the foe of Edric !" u We must be cautious and silent,"
Miid Illlen, "and not discover who we are ; you know the reasons that oblige nie to adhere to that inviolable secrecy, that has limited vour father and my- self to obscurity ; but the time I trust will arrive, when secrecv will be no h.nger necessary; besides, our more immediate safetv demands it now. FitzoMMc has been three times defeat¬ ed h\ Edric ; and I should dread if he knew we were the friends of Edric, le^t he .should discontinue his appa¬ rent ueneroMty, and still cherish an I'liniilv in his breast towards the va¬ liant youth he eould not conquer—and make us suffer the revenge he would take on him P* In such conversations, Ellen and Elgiva passed their lime; and, when b 2
they were visited bv Fitzosric, he treat¬ ed them with every mark of attention and respect. So gentle, so friendly was his conduct toward* them, that Ellen and her daughter chid them¬ selves for suffering sn*pk ton to dare encroach in their misuU inwards om\ who seemed (o act so tndy ;>em rons and amiable.
CHAPTER III. 1>,om the moment tlie Baron Fitz¬ osric discovered the ladies in the cot¬ tage, he had resolved to withdraw himself from the confederate armies ; and, as soon as Shrewsbury had fallen into the hands of the Conqueror, wrote his submission to the Norman voke; and 5 unexpectedly, abandoned his for¬ mer friends, the Earls Brient and Fitz¬ osborne in their greatest distress. The cruel desertion of so powerful an ally, entirely damped the courage of tht* confederate Earls, and they fell into the hands of Edric the Forester ; cxe-
crating the treacherous conduct of Fitzosric, who had been the instigator of all the evils into which they had fallen, Fitzosric had, in reality, hired some soldiers to seem to pursue himself and servants immediately after the defeat of Shrewsbury, merely to compass the design he meditated; which was to remove Ellen and Elgiva to the Castle of St. Egbert; in which he fortunately succeeded. His heart wavering be¬ fore, now declared the object of his preference, to be Elgiva. Her youth and innocence charmed him, though he could not suppress the ardent ad¬ miration that spoke in favour of Elleu. Another strong inducement led him to prefer Elgiva : he overheard her call
on the name of Edric when she fell into a sw r oon, and doubted not but that he vvas tenderly beloved ; a most powerful opportunity now r offered of his being privately revenged on the person he hated more than ever, for the principal reason, that he could not conquer him; and was jealous of a rival in love or war. With what transport did he now pursue the dic¬ tates of his soul! and exult in the dis¬ appointment he knew Edric would suffer when he could not discover where they were gone. Thus passed away a week. The Baron continuing to treat them with great respect; because fearful of giv¬ ing them any alarm. Ellen, impatient b 4
to quit the Castle of St, Egbert, fre¬ quently expressed her thanks, and re¬ peated her ardent desire to remove ; but still Fitzosric had some plausible excuse to offer in opposition. They wanted a change of apparel; but that difficulty was sooa overcome by his presenting them with some very elegant clothes, which he said belong¬ ed to a sister of his, who had lately been there on a visit, but was now in London; and requested they would make use of them while they remained there; and he hoped a few days would enable them to depart in safety. He entreated they would favour him with their company to dinner; and begged thev would endeavour to make them-
selves as happy as possible during their unavoidable separation frora their (\ iemU. The generous offer was accepted v\ ith thanks ; and they retired to dress to attend him agreeable to his request at dinner. The robe vvhich Ellen wore, was purple and gold ; her petticoat white, and richly ornamented. Elgiva's habit was white and silver. Dress, in gene¬ ral, makes a great alteration. Ellen's natural elegance appeared to great ad¬ vantage in the dress she wore ; and Elgiva lost not the smallest share of her beauty when adorned in a habit that so well became her, and which for richness surpassed every other she b 5
had ever worn. They neither of theni wished for such grandeur, and would have been exceedingly happy if the Baron could have accommodated them with a suit of plain attire each ; but they were necessitated lo wear what they could till they left the Castle of St. Egbert. When they entered the apartment where the Baron was sitting reading, he arose, and w ith great politeness led them to a seat. His eyes sparkled with delight — he gazed alternately on each, enraptured.— Ellen, who could not avoid observing the more than ordinary attention he paid to them, — began to fear, that all his kindness towards them was not the effects of disinterested generosity.—
She sighed—Elgiva's gentle bosom caught the contagion ; each partook of the same ideas, imagining that this day would give them cause of future unhappiness. The day passed on—Fitzosric sat late. The maid was called that at¬ tended I hem, and they bade him good night. When they had proceeded half way along the gallery leading to the apartment, the Earl sent his favourite servant, Ethelwald, to say he wished to speak lo Elgiva. She immediately returned, to know his pleasure; and Ethelwald retired. She entreated to know the reason of his wishing her to return.
" Elgiva," said Fitzosric, " I wish to speak a few words to you alone. You cannot be ignorant, my sweet girl, of the ascendancy which your beauty has gained over my heart! my eyes have often expressed the language of love, and declared what passes in the bosom of Fitzosric! till now, I have not had an opportunity of revealing to you the ardent passion that consumes me! deign, lovely Elgiva, to accept the truest love that ever existed in a human breast! consent to be the wife of Fitzosric, Lord of these extensive domains ; and let me glad the hearts of my people by giving them a lady of your worth and beauty!" Elgiva looked astonished at this amazing declaration — her mother's words, that she feared kis kindness teas
not the effects of disinterested genero¬ sity) struck forcibly on her mind ; and a secret dread unfelt, unknown be¬ fore, made her experience every un¬ easy sensation, and prevented her re¬ plying. u Speak, Elgiva!" said Fitzosric, " or may I interpret your silence in my favour ?" " My Lord V replied Elgiva, «I have not the vanity to imagine you are serious; and if I thought you was, I have not the ambition to aspire to such an honour ! I am truly grateful for all the favours my mother and I have re¬ ceived, but the intended honour I mu>t beg to decline.'*
" Perhaps, Elgiva," said he, press¬ ing her hand with fervour to his lips, " perhaps your heart is already be¬ stowed on some more favoured lover ! and for him, Fitzosric is rejected 1 There is distraction in the thought, El¬ giva, which I want words to express ! torture me not vvith the thought! \et if another possesses your affections, I shall be miserable indeed P* Elgiva was silent. She remem¬ bered her beloved Edric ; uncertain whether he lived or had fallen in bat¬ tle ; and sighed at the dreadful idea, that she might see him no more! While these melancholy thoughts floated in her mind, which caused the tears to tremble in her eyes, she was
alarmed bv hearing a melodious and heavenly voice say these words; * Remember how \ou oft ha\e sworn, When firat I uh^ynur bi'nlt ; ^ our love should never know a change, ST For Jane ?litr m «*«. \ uiir pride!" Fitzosric started ! his countenance . hanged from the animated glow of health and love, to a deadly paleness ; he dropped Elgiva s hand. He trem¬ bled ; and putting his hand involun¬ tary on his sword, looked wildlv round as if in search of the cause of his alarm ! " What is the matter, my Lord P' s>aid Elgiva, perceiving his extreme agitation and terror.
u The voice! thevoice!' exclaim¬ ed he, unheeding to whom he replied ; and kept gazing on a distant part of the room. Elgiva was greath terrified at his manner, believing him disordered in his intellects ; the declaration of love to herself had given her much dis¬ pleasure, blended with uneasiness ;— his present singular behaviour increas¬ ed it; and she thought it a fit oppor¬ tunity of leaving the room. She there¬ fore hurried as swift as possible away; and soon joined her mother.
CHAPTER IV. u Good Heaven!" exclaimed El- oiva, as she entered her mother's apartment; "the Baron Pitzosric is ^ surely deranged in his senses! Ah! my dear mother—your words were in¬ deed prophetic—the civilities we re¬ ceive from his Lordship are not dis¬ interested ; the sooner we quit this place the better !'* " Then are my suspicions confirm¬ ed ?" said Ellen, " though I dreaded to wound you with my fears—I have been miserable ever siuce we entered
St. Egbert's castle ; mv heavv heart denoted our being hurried from the peaceful cottage, was not merely the effect of accident, or the will to serve us; it was premeditated ; and we, des¬ titute of the power of defence, fell easily into Fitzosric's detested snares: but the wife and daughter of the good Edgar can bear misfortunes with for¬ titude, and continue virtuous," said she, embracing Elgiva; then address¬ ing the maid, said, "Agatha, you are one of Lord Fitzosric's servants ; if in his interest, I am sorry; if not, let me not confound the innocent with the guilty." " There is something in your coun¬ tenance, madam," replied Agatha, " that I would wish to serve to the
utmost of mv abilities ; but my Lord's commands must be obeyed: I have lived thirteen vears and a half in the Castle ; the Baron is an odd sort of a gentleman, but he is tolerably kind to his servants at times. But my Lady, oh! dear soul; she was a good lady indeed ; I may almost say, an Angel upon earth: never, never, can I meet her equal; never, while I live, shall I forget the amiable, the mysterious Lady Jane." " Mysterious Lady Jane!" ex¬ claimed Elgiva, recollecting the stanza she heard pronounced in the chamber vvith the Baron ; and forgetting her own and mother's apparently danger¬ ous situation, only wished to be in¬ formed of what had given her some
alarm. " Tell me, I conjure you," con¬ tinued she, " of the mysterious Lady Jane! for I am strangely interested. While with the Baron, a sweet voice stole plaintively on my ear, and each word made an impression on my heart which I shall never forget; mention¬ ing somebody of the name of Jane— Wliat could it mean ?" Agatha shook her head, as if she was acquainted with something which she did not wish to reveal, and said she would take some future opportu¬ nity of speaking of her late Lady ; and was about to leave the room. " Rack me not with suspense," said Elgiva, taking her hand and detaining her, " but have pity on me, and case
the solicitude of my •aching hear*, and tell me now.*' Ellen experienced extreme sur- piise on hearing her daughter so seem¬ ingly earnest about, what in their pre¬ sent circumstances, she deemed a tritle, and intreated Agatha to gratify her daughter's singular curiosity. The maid complied, first securing the door for fear of intrusion, and then prefaced her recital with observing, it was not altogether right to mention her masters affairs, which, in all pro¬ bability, might lessen him in their es¬ teem ; yet, she so much loved her dear Lady Jane, that she always felt happy while speaking of her, though she had been long, long dead.
" It is now between thirteen and fourteen years ago, since I first entered the service of the Baron Fitzosric, as waiting-woman to Lady Fitzosric; she was a very beautiful and accomplished lady ; never in my life did I meet wiih one so truly good-natured, so amiable, and friendly, as Ladv Jane, as she was usuallv called. " All her domestics loved her as w ell as I did, but the Baron always behaved very sullenly to her (at least all the time that 1 lived with her), and his strano*eand ankind conduct caused her many tears. Before her marriage w ith the Baron Fitzosric, she had been mar¬ ried to the Earl of Wallingford, the former owner of this castle, by whom she had one son.
" The Eari of Wallingford and our present Baron were friends from in¬ fancy, and loved each other more than brothers, if possible; he often staid some months at this cattle, when he came to this part of the country to rnjoy the company of his friend, for it seems they had been companions in the war<, a "d had been victorious fel¬ low soldiers together; and vvhen it was reported, that the Danes invaded this land, about twentv-one vears ago, Lord Wallingford and the Baron col¬ lected their forces, and, under the command of the valiant Earl of Devon, joined to oppose them. " Unfortunately the Earl of Wal¬ lingford fell (as supposed in a skirmish, for there was no real battle), by an
arrow, which pierced through his body; but, alas! his death was certainly in¬ tended, for at the time the fatal arrows vvas shot, the Earl was stabbed in the back with a dagger, whicli was found by some one who preserved it. " The Baron Fitzosric was the first, it i^ems,to bring Lady Jane the mourn¬ ful intelligence ; and being her hus¬ band's most esteemed friend, he used all his abilities to soften the grief and distress which he saw Lady Jane ex¬ perience for her irreparable loss. Thus far I have often heard Lady Jane in the distress her heart daily indured, say, and what a generous friend she always believed Baron Fitzosric to be. " However, time moved away, and
Lord Wallingford had been dead se¬ veral months. The kind attention of the Baron increased Lady Jane's es¬ teem for him, as she perceived the ex¬ treme attention he paid to her and her son ; the pains he look with all her te¬ nants and domestics, and his assi¬ duities to alleviate the sorrows that dwelt at her heart Time, in part, chased away some of her grief, though she alwa\s remembered Lord Wal- lingford with the tenderest affections; yet, at the expiration of a twelvemonth, Lady Jane w as so much pressed by her friends to marry again, that to oblige them she suffered them to pre¬ vail in behalf of Baron Fitzosric. Ac¬ cording to the regret I Jiave seen Lady Jane feel for Lord Wallingford; vol. i. c
I do not imagine she would ever have married again, had not her friends so strongly persuaded her. " For the first three months of their marriage I have heard Lady Jane say the Baron treated her with apparent great affection; but soon after, she per¬ ceived a very great alteration in his manner, to what she had formerly ex¬ perienced. He often treated her very harshly, and gave way to such sudden starts of uassion, so widely diflerent from the amiable and tender disposition of Lord Wallingford, that, too late, she perceived the error into which she had fallen. <r About two years after her marriage,
she had the misfortune to lose her son, which almost broke her heart, and by whieh means the Baron Fitzosric be¬ came sole Lord of all the vast domains of Lord Wallingford, which is im¬ mense. Lady Jane's grief for her be- loved child may be easily conceived ; after which period a visible alteration took place in the conduct and beha- v iour of the Baron. The desire of no- veltvin his affections excluded Lady Jane from holding any place in his heart; and, while he bestowed his love on others, the meek Lady Jane was treated with insult and ill humour; a very usual thing you will allow; for when once a married man gives way to love any body else but his wife, he never can love her. c 2
" Several years passed away in this manner, and at length he fixed his re¬ gard on a young village maid, named Birtha, and stole her from her father's. The men employed in so doing brought her to the castle ; and Ladv Jane, bv tbe light of the moon, as she was look- ing out at the window, saw the unfortu¬ nate Birtha eonveved into the castle. This affair happened when I had lived *bout a year with her Ladyship. 4i After the above occurrence, Lady Jane was never truly happy ; she had made many discoveries, that hung heavy on her mind, though she forbore to complain; but certainly the death of the worthy Lord Wallingford, the loss of her son, and her unhappy second
marriage, with the ill treatment she received frora the Baron, were causes sufticient to distress a feeling heart, had there been no other—one soon occurred which I was witness to."

CHAPTER V. " One very fine summer's evening Lady Jane proposed a walk for the benefit of the air, as she had been un¬ well best part of the day. I was the only person that attended her; and she directed her steps towards the wood, on the right-hand side of St. Egbert's Castle. It was near dusk, and I en¬ treated she would return, as the place was very solitary. " ' Agatha/ she replied, ' this soli¬ tary situation is in unison with my hapless thoughts-—but i, will inform
you of the reason why I walk here, at an hour not very proper, I must con¬ fess, in case any one should be wicked enough to hurt us. *' c c Last night I dreamed that Lord Wallingford came to me, pale, and with the arrow in his side; while, to my amazement, he said, ' Oh! my be¬ loved Jane I I did not fall by the chance of war, but by the haud of my treacherous friend. You are deprived of our beloved child also by his infa- mous designs ; and he too will attempt your hfe, if you are not particularly cautious. Yes, Jane, the murderer of your Wallingford was Fitzosric !— your son is not dead !—-let your bosom cherish the cheering rays of hope, for * you will sec him again ; and if you c 4
* wish further to be convinced, walk in the wood this night, about half an hour after sun-set, and believe the truth I now reveal.' " * The shadow then vanished into air, and I awoke. Terror shook every limb ; Fitzosric was in a profound sleep by my side ; I looked on his handsome countenance, sleeping in all the ease of conscious innocence, and said, mentally, * Is it possible he could be guilty of murdering his friend ! Unkindly as he has treated me— wretched as he has made me—I would not for the world he should have that guilt on his soul P " ' The idea of the visionary Lord Wallingford chased sleep from mv
f\\es, I impatiently awaited the hour of rising. Fitzosric, this day, has beeu more kind to me than usual; but such horror has possessed my heart through this dreadful dream, that I tremble at his touch, and shrink from it as from the touch of a murderer! My soul is terrified at the sight of him. My in¬ disposition, which is the effect of long- continued sorrow, and oppressive me¬ lancholv, seeminglv has awakened his affection. Alas 1 too late, he teazes me with inquiries of my complaint!— Ah. Agatha ! my complaint is deeply rooled in my afflicted heart, to which peace can never be restored. I have been impatient till the approach of sun-set; and this is the real cause, Agatha, that brings mc here. 1 c 5
" I was much surprised, as you may suppose, and entreated her not to venture farther into the wood, for fear of any accident: and, though I was greatly terrified, I endeavoured to per¬ suade Lady Jane it was only an idle dream. u Lady Jane looked round her every way, as if greatly disappointed, sighed heavily, and said, * Well, it may be an idle dream ! but it has tor¬ tured my heart all the day ; and I am certain the impression it has made on my mind can never be erased. However, I will be directed by you. Lead me to the Castle ; for I see no one here that will give me the expected information. 5
" She leaned on my arm ; she trem¬ bled violently, and wept in silence. " We had not proceeded far on our return, when a rustling among the trees i ather alarmed me; and turning round lo see from whence the sound i a me, observed a man advancing to- YKUtU us. My heart was agitated by Jear; but Lady Jane was far otherwise. She looked undaunted, and, with ar¬ dent anxiety in her expressive counte¬ nance, asked who he was * " l Be not alarmed, Lady Jane/ said the stranger, * I have a few words for your private ear, if you will honour me with the hearing.' " A man with a long white beard c 6
now came forward; he was wrapped up in a long cloak, which completely covered him, all but his beard—for his face was not discernable. " ' For Heaven's sake ! who are you?' exclaimed Lady Jane; c What is your business with me ?' " To which the stranger replied :— 6 I will inform you, in the first place, I am well known to you; but having something particular to communicate, have assumed this disguise, as at pre¬ sent I must remain concealed. I as¬ sure your Ladyship, I have endea¬ voured to gain an opportunity of speak¬ ing to you for several months past, and now I dread to wound you with what I I have to disclose. 5
" * Proceed,* said Lady Jane, see¬ ing he hesitated, £ and do not heed my servant.' " l An alarm was spread that the Danes were landed, and were march¬ ing towards Ashdon,' replied the stranger, i The nobles instantly col¬ lected their forces, and proceeded to that place, in order to repel the in¬ vaders ; but it was only some evil- minded people had created a report to disturb the peace of Edward, sur¬ named the Confessor, and the country by fancied evils. However, it was very near coming to serious conse¬ quences, as they began to attack one another, some by mistake, and some for want of something to do. Many arrows were discharged before the
tumult could be subsided. I was with¬ in two of Lord Wallingford. The ar¬ row which pierced the heart of that worthy man came from an hired assas¬ sin, who aimed it fatally at his Lord¬ ship. At the same time I saw the Baron Fitzosric put his hand on Lord Walliogrford's back, and he soon after fell from his horse. " i The party rushed forward, and did not heed Lord Wallingford ; but I who saw there was some treachery in the affair, stopped, and kneeling down by Lord Wallingford, whose breath had forsook his body, saw a dagger plunged to the very hilt in his back. I drew it forth, and was shocked to see the instrument, as I knew who was its owner.
" ( Ever since that fatal hour I have treasured up that dagger, oflen de¬ signing to give it yon, but being fear¬ ful of afHictinir you, when vou knew that the Baron Fitzosric was the mur¬ derer. Here is the dagger ! you will recollect it was usually worn by Lord Wallingford's friend.' " Lady Jane took the dagger, and, looking stedfastly on it, with horror exclaimed, " My God ! it was indeed the dagger of Fitzosric ! Am I then really wedded to his murderer ?*—and fell into my arms, bereft of every sense. " We exerted our efforts to recover her, and with difficulty succeeded.— She secured the dagger from all eyes,
and slowly walked between the stran¬ ger and myself, supporting her to the extremity of the wood. " Lady Jane was deeply affected ; yet, before she reached the end of the avenue of trees, sho asked how he came to seek her in that place } " To which the stranger replied. 1 This morning I dreamed a very sin¬ gular dream. I thought Lord Wal¬ lingford came to me, and said, Give the dagger you took from my body to Lady Jane — let her know she is married to the villain who robbed her Walling¬ ford of life! At sun-set you trill meet her in the tvood; fail not to attend her at that hour! — and then disap¬ peared.
u c I have often had a command of the like nature during the course of the last six months ; and have often seen Lord Wallingford in my dreams-—but never to desire it so positively as this morning. I now determined to obey the command, and succeeded in meet¬ ing you. My own wishes, even from the moment of Lord Wallingford's death, prompted to reveal the whole to you. My soul was shocked when I heard you was married to the Baron ; and then I resolved to be for ever secret, because I would not afflict your future peace : nor should I ever have revealed it, but by the solemn com¬ mand of Lord Wallingford—and now, agreeable to his will, I have per¬ formed it.*
" ' Thank you, thank you P said Lady Jane, aud the mysterious stran¬ ger darted amidst the thickest of the trees. " We hastened home. Lady Jane scarcely spoke a word all ihe way, so entirely were her thoughts enveloped in the stranger's confirmation of the tes¬ timony of the visionary Lord Walling¬ ford. For myself, I was thunderstruck at the idea of the Baron's guilt, and expressed myself accordingly to my amiable, disconsolate, and suffering Lady. She entreated me not to men¬ tion a word of what had happened, and 1 kept the promise I gave till this hour. *• Ladv Jane, soon after this terrible
event, grew extremely dejected ; she endeavoured to shun the Baron, who in all probability, from interest, treated her with more kindness ; but she felt so great an abhorrence to his caresses and attention, that she avoided hirn a^ much as lay in her power; for she really beheld him with sensations nearly allied to horror. " Ladv Jane soon lost a relish for all company and every kind of amuse¬ ment. The only thing that could give her any satisfaction was to allow her to sit and ponder over her unprecedented misfortunes. She seldom entered into conversation, and seemed to have a great weight of something very parti¬ cular labouring; in her mind—often ut- tered strange incoherent words— aU
ways saying either—" Poor Birtha !' or < Poor Jane!" Her conduct was now very mysterious. I often missed her for several hours together, and have searched every part of the Castle I dared venture into to find her— sometimes without effect. 1 feared her misfortunes would turn her brain; for whatever she thought, she confided it in her own bosom; and if I ever asked, as often I did, for I truly loved her, to be entrusted with the cause of her griefs, all her answer was— c I ara greatly troubled, Agatha!—you know enough—seek to know no more!' " Three months after our meeting the stranger in the wood, Lady Jane died suddenly, and was buried by the Baron's strange desire in one of the
apartments of the Castle, no one knew exactly where ; and the Baron was so cruel to me, that hc would not suffer rae to take farewel ofher much lamented clay; and although we all begged per- mi>>ion to attend our dear Lady to the grave, he positively denied us. i: Ever -since then the disturbed spirit ol Lady Jane walks in the North gallery and the chambers leading therefrom. Sometimes we hear her sweet voice sing so mournfully, com¬ plaining to Lord Fitzosric. Four or the months pass away, and she is silent; then again she appears and sings so plaintively ; and I have parti¬ cularly taken notice, that something remarkable happens after the appear¬ ance of Lady Jane, as if she came on
purpose to warn some one of evil. Per¬ haps her spirit is concerned for your being here, and wishes to save you frora the designs of the Baron. Lord bless you, Ladies I have heard the words so often repeated that I can say them by heart—her song is usually " Remember how you oft liave .swdrn, When first I was your bride, Your love should never know a change, For Jane she was your pride." « The same," said Elgiva; " Mer¬ ciful God! how astonishing is this ; poor Lady Jane. Yes, these are the very words I heard spoken, which so much alarmed me." «Yes," replied Agatha, " and there are other astonishing things in
St. Egbert's Castle; but I am afraid of terrifying you." " Our terrors cannot be augmented, Agatha," said Ellen ; '* for the Baron i dread and despise ; he is my only terror." « Why then, madam, I will tell vou " said Agatha:—" A Danish no- bleman of very high rank, had the mis¬ fortune of being taken prisoner in the time of the Great Alfred, many years ago; he was brought to this castle, and strongly confined by Lord Sefrid, uncle by the mother's side to the late Lord Wallingford's grandfather; and in those dreadful chambers, after he had been a long time in confinement, he was murdered; no one could tell
why, or by whom ; but many believed he killed himself; however, there his body was found dead. And his spirit has continued to haunt the chambers in the north wing of the Castle in par¬ ticular, so much so, that no one dared to enter in them, or use them ; such a terror has the speclre of the haunted chamber filled every body with, that I do not think there is any one in the Castle at present, except Ethelwald, who would venture into the north gal¬ lery, either fcy night or by day. " When Lord Arnulph, son to Lord Sefrid, came to the estates, he would fain have treated their fears as a kind of romantic superstition ; for he would never believe in any thing of the kind ; but his people were always complain-
ing, and at length prevailed on him, to have the spirit laid in those chambers ; and the north wing of the Castle has never since been used on any account. He was also prevailed on by the Clergy to have the doors strongly fastened up, and the keys put away or buried, no body knows where, lest any one should be tempted to open them through cu- rioMty ; and the mystery of the haunted chamber still remains unknown to this day. " But, alas! madam, it is not the Danish Lord, but Lady Jane that haunts the Castle, and increases the mystery of that horrid place; and sometimes I have heard her sing with a heavy sigh-— " Fly, to avoid the fete of Jane."*— VOL, I. D
as if to forewarn people of approach¬ ing danger. I often think, and I can¬ not drive the thought from my mind, that Lady Jane did not die fairly ; or why does her spirit wander so mourn¬ fully about, cautioning people to avoid ihe fate of Jane ! I never shall forget the day of her death, if I were to live for ever. I saw her, and helped her to dress in the morning as usual; about noon I missed her, and the Baron came home; he continued in the drawing- room till late at night, and nobody was admitted into the room but Ethel¬ wald. " At the usual hour of Lady Jane's going to bed, I inquired if she was ready for me to attend her; I was an¬ swered no. I thouglit I heard my
Lady's voice speak louder than usual, but did not dare go till I was ordered. About midnight I met the Baron going to his apartment; I asked if my Lady was ready for me to attend her? He answered me very surly, and said, c My Lady wanted no more of my as¬ sistance.' I begged him to say what he meant, as I always attended Lady Jane to her chamber at night. ' I am much troubled, Agatha,' said he, i you will never more have the satis¬ faction of seeing your Lady; she drop¬ ped suddenly off her chair about an hour ago, and expired:' he then hur¬ ried into his room and shut the door, leaving rae sinking with astonishment and grief. I have before said, that the Baron denied my seeing her, or attend¬ ing her to the grave. My thoughts on o 2
this singular occasion I cannot de¬ scribe. Ab, Ladies! the Baron has a great deal to answer for." " So I believe," replied Elgiva, clasping her uplifted hauds; " and Hea¬ ven in its. mercy lead us safely out of his power." Ellen was so overcome by what she had heard Agatha relate, that she could scarce articulate a reply. Theii situation seemed to her more dreadful than ever; and every tormenting thought took possession of her mind. Agatha, soon after, bade them adieu for the night, leaving Ellen and Elgiva racked with conjectures unable to describe.
? CHAPTER VI. A sleepless night was passed by Ellen and her daughter. They framed several plans to escape from the Castle of St. Egbert, which were rejected as soon as formed, unable to come to any conclusion, for Elgiva had observed that the outer door was strongly guarded, and feared the domestics as well as some men in the habit of soldiers, were placed there by Lord Fitzosric's order, to intercept their flight if they should attempt it. She doubted not but that the man, of whom she had heard such horrid transactions related, with re- n 3
gard to his friend the Earl of Walling¬ ford, and the mention Agatha made of Birtha, she imagined if he could be capable of such guilty deeds, with the addition of ill treatment to Lady Jane, he would not be scrupulous in his con¬ duct towards them, if his evil genius had inspired him with bad thoughts. Now was the time when they want¬ ed the powerful arm of Edric the Fo¬ rester, or her father, Edgar Rosenberg; but, alas! they neither of them knew that Ellen and Elgiva were inclosed within the Castle of St. Egbert; or those dear objects would soon have been released by them from the op¬ pressive power of Fitzosric. Leaving them absorbed in the
gloomy ideas the uncertainty of their destiny was calculated to inspire, 1 will now give some account of Edric and Edgar, Edgar Rosenberg, the husband of Ellen and rather of Elgiva, a man of great understanding, though but io au humble sphere of life, had been called from his peaceful situation, in the forest of Ellesmere, to London, to accept of a very beneficial situation under go¬ vernment. William, soon after he be¬ came Conqueror, having heard much spoken in praise of the honour and in¬ tegrity of Rosenberg, by Lord Somer- ville, on whose manor of Ellesmere Edgar and his family happily resided; who, recommending him as a man of d 4
uncommon talents, and well calculated to hold a situation of the most import¬ ant trust, the King immediately placed him in a very advantageous situation, vvell imagining that he would be dili¬ gent in the discharge of every duty. As affairs were not yet settled, and the turbulence of the times made people afraid of trusting one another, a secret of importance to the mutual happiness of Edgar and his wife, in¬ duced him to think it prudent to let his amiable Ellen and her daughter remain in their own habitation, till a proper place could be fixed on for their future abode. His merit had been often, obscured, by the secret which compelled them to live in a very re¬ tired manner, and prevented him from
exercising those excellent talents, which would have been an ornament to any family, and more particularly to the age in which he lived. He therefore was obliged to content himself with seeing them about once a month, till hoppier times would convey his loved Ellen and Elgiva to a situation where peace and happiness should unite to w elconie them. In those times when England was torn by inward commo¬ tions, he thought it best for them to live in retirement, unvexed with the cala¬ mities that desolated the country. The duties of his station would not allow him to visit them often ; but ho contented himself with hearing from theme
d 5
The advancement of Edgar paved the way for those honors, which soon after fell to the share of his adopted son Edric, of whom he was very fond; he often named him with ecstacy to his friends, and extolled his well-deserved merits. He requested him to come io London, which summons he immedi¬ ately obeyed, and Lord Somervilie ac¬ companied him, Though brought up with Edgar as a forester, yet Edric had always au ambition for a military life. William had often heard Lord Somervilie speak highly in praise of Edric; he sought to conciliate his friendship; and when they arrived in town Lord Somervilie introduced him to the King, who took & very great liking to him, and gave
him a captain's commission in the army. Edric, who, in obedience to the fancy of the King, was called Edric the Forester, soon after the honor con¬ ferred on him, waited on his father, as he usually called Rosenberg, for he had found in him the affections of a parent: each were overjoyed at the sight of tbe other; Edgar congratu¬ lated Edric on his success, and seemed to anticipate the rising glories of the youthful hero. Edric was ordered to join his regi¬ ment in a few days, during which time Rosenberg and Edric hurried to Elles¬ mere, for him to bid adieu lo his snp- d6
posed mother and sister, for whom Edgar perceived his adopted son had an extreme affection. Ile now thought it necessary to undeceive Edric, and let him know he was not his son, a circumstanee which neither Edric nor Elgiva were acquainted with till now. 1 shall pass over the effect of this declaration, till a future opportunity, any more than by observing that Edric obtained permission to pay his addres¬ ses to his beloved Elgiva, of whom he always w r as extremely fond, but dread¬ ed to indulge his affection, as he be¬ lieved she was his sister; but this de¬ claration made him truly happy, and he joined his regiment with a degree of fervour and happiness he never before
experienced, determining to exert all his abilities to render himself worthy the daughter of his friend. Three or four battles were fought, iu all which Edric gave such proofs of his courage, and acquitted himself so entirely to the satisfaction of his King, that he soon after honored him with the command of a very powerful army, with which he marched to op¬ pose his enemies, the Barons, who, though obliged to submit to the Con- queror, still at times would revolt and set the nation in new disturbances, destroying many of its inhabitants. Edric had often defeated the Barons, and hoped to restore peace to his be¬ loved country; but while the ardent
wish expanded in his bosom, another disturbance broke out, headed by the confederate Earls Fitzosborne, Biient, and the Baron Fitzosric, who, assem¬ bling all their tenants and vassals, formed a very powerful army. Edric, who had been so repeatedly victorious, was proposed to oppose them with a numerous army ; but the Earls had been so expeditious in col¬ lecting their forces, that Edric expe¬ rienced uncommon alarm, when he learned that the rebel army were within a few days march of Ellesmere, the residence of his dear mother (as he usually called her) Ellen Rosenberg, and his beloved Elgiva, for whom from infancy his breast had glowed with the fondest affection.
Rosenberg, his protector from child¬ hood, was far, far absent; he could give no assistance to his wife and daugh- ter, for whom Edric trembled, as he learned the approach of the confede¬ rate lords towards their dwelling. He pressed forward with all imaginable speed, in order to remove them from the threatened danger; and, when withiri a few miles of Shrewsbury, the army under his command halted at an advantageous situation, awaiting to give the enemy battle. Edric, anxious for the removal of Ellen and Elgiva, no sooner had chosen their ground, than confiding in the friendship of a trusty captain, informed him that he must be absent a few hours, in order to save the wife
and daughter of hit* friend and protec¬ tor Rosenberg from falling into the hands of the enemy. Time would not admit of delav. Edric changed part of his habit; and, disguised in a long cloak, attended by an assistant, they mounted their fleet horses, and rather (lew than rode to the habitation of Ellen Rosenberg. Ellen was overjoyed to behold her Edric arrive to preserve her, at a time when she had nearly given herself up for lost. There was no time for words. He ordered his attendant to carry a large trunk, wiiich he knew contained many valuable articles, and put it in a place of safety ; then mounting Ellen on the horse, and taking Elgiva on his
own, he bade them be under no appre¬ hension, for he would not leave them till he had secured them a safe retreat. Avoiding the road to Shrewsbury, near which place lay the confederate army, he turned away towards Bre- theren, though he was fearful he should not be able to cross the river. Haste would not permit them to make a choice of a situation, and no habita¬ tion offered, which drove them nearly to despair; till arriving under the walls of the Castle of St. Egbert, whicli in his hurry at that time he did not recollect, he observed a mean cot¬ tage. Unable to proceed further on account of his return to the army, he alighted, and lifting the latch, entered
the humble dwelling, where he found a poor old woman alone, " Good mother!" exclaimed Edric, " can you be so kind to receive my mo¬ ther and sister under your roof a few days—a fortnight at most. I bring them from the distressing seat of war, to preserve their lives; let rae have your answer as quick as possible," " Alas ! sir," said the old woman, " my cottage is very small; 1 have not room for two—but one can stav vvith me if you please, and one can go and be with my daughter — she lives hard by." "Oh!" said Edric, " my mother
and sister will die at the bare idea of a separation. Here, take this purse, it contains forty pieces of gold, divide it with your daughter, and resign your cottage to those so dear to me. I only ask it for one fortnight; every thing of yours shall be kept in safety, and your future reward shall be considerable^ if you will so far oblige me." The sight of the purse made the old woman immediately determine, and she complied with Edric's wish, which was, to resign them her humble dwelling, and to return and do them any little service they might stand in need of. Edric, overjoyed that he had found some place to shelter them from the
impending danger, ran to lead them into the house. The old woman wel¬ comed them with great civility ; but Ellen, who had surveyed the lofty black towers df St. Egbert's Castle with sen¬ sations of' melancholy awe, no sooner entered the cottage, than she inquired the name of the Castle, and to whom it belonged. " The Castle is called St. Egbert's Castle," replied the old woman; " and its owner is the Baron Fitzosric, who is now at the wars ; and he owns all the lands round about," Edric and Ellen looked at one another almost petrified and unable to articulate a syllable. Sensations of an uncommon nature filled his bosom at
the mention of the castle's belonging to Fitzosric, the foe he had wished to avoid, and now had brought the two people most dear to him on earth so near his habitation, Ellen shuddered, and strove to conceal emotions that agitated hev breast from the anxious and penetrat¬ ing eve of Elsfiva, who observed that her mother and Edric was alarmed at the mention of his name, but was silent in the presence of the old woman. Elleu Rosenberg, first recovering from her embarrassment, requested the old woman would endeavour to pro¬ cure them some refreshment; who said, she must go and see what her
daughter had; for her house was a very poor one—and then went her way. Edric then said, " I am mute with astonishment to think that the man of all others I would wish to avoid is the owner of this place, which malicious fortune has conducted us to. Our residence at Ellesmere has been in a very retired manner; but it amazes me to think that I never heard of his being the owner of this place, nor that his estates lay here about. However, the time will not permit a further removal. You, my dear friends, are necessitated to remain here till the next battle is decided ; w r hen, if it pleases God I survive, your safety shall be my first
care. Be secret!—let no one know who you are ; mention to no one that you are allied to Rosenberg; and above all, avoid saying you know any thing of me. I know the hatred Fitz¬ osric bears me, and how greatly he would rejoice if he could give me trou¬ ble. Perhaps, my amiable friends, he might make you suffer to revenge him¬ self upon me." " Oh! rightly judged," said Ellen, " no one shall know vvho vve are. I see the dangers to which we should be exposed if he suspects we are your friends ; for which reason I will nei¬ ther speak o my husband nor vou till I embrace you I oth in a place of safety. My dear Edric, a thousand thanks I
owe you for your kind attention ; delay no longer your return to the army. Heaven, in its mercy, will be your guard and ours!" He tenderly embraced them bothj and commending them to that Provi¬ dence who is the guardian of the in no- cent, bade them farewel; for Elgiva was mistress of his heart, and he sighed with regret at parting vvith the fair maid he adored. El&iva sighed as he turned from her, and with difficulty suppressed the starting tear. Edric mounted his horse, and was out of sight in an instemt, so anxious was he to regain the army* fearful of the enemy's ad-
vancing before he returned to head his forces. A week however elapsed, and the enemy did not approach, a circum¬ stance that much surprised them, (though it allowed Edric an opportu¬ nity of going to the cottage to see if Ellen and Elgiva were safe.)—The supposed cause soon reached them by a deserter from the confederate army, which was, that, contrary to every one's expectation, the Baron Fitzosric had hinted his intention to withdraw him¬ self frora the confederacy, assigning for a reason that he acknowledged William for his King. This conduct greatly distressed and embarrassed the Earls Fitzosborne and VOL. I. E
Brient, who had been entirely insti¬ gated by the Baron to act as they had done. Their army by his desertion would be considerably weakened. However, as they w 7 ere driven to ex¬ tremities, they determined to give Edric the Forester battle, and marched to Shrewsbury, where they found Fitz¬ osric ready for the onset. They in¬ quired if what they had heard concern- in^ his deserting their cause vvas a truth, but he positively denied ever having given such an idea a moment's thought. A desperate battle was now com¬ menced. But in the midst of this calamity Fitzosric treacherously aban¬ doned his friends to their fate ; which victory was in favour of Edric, for he
look the town of Shrewsbury and the two lords prisoners, with many power¬ ful nobles, and the rest of their army vvas completely routed.
E 2
CHAPTER VII. Edric's first object after the vic¬ tory was decided, and they had rested from the fatigue they had undergone, was to fly to relieve the anxiety he knew Ellen Rosenberg would experi¬ ence while his fate remained doubt¬ ful; and elated with the idea of the happiness Elgiva would feel when she saw him alive and had escaped every danger. Flattered with these fond and delu¬ sive thoughts, he hastened towards the cottage. But what words can convey
his astonishment and horror, when he arrived there and found no Ellen—no Elgiva. The old woman was there, but she could give no manner of infor¬ mation what was become of them, as she on her return, one day, found the place deserted, the door open, and no one could tell what was become of them. Frantic with the dreadful intelli¬ gence, and unknowing how toad, ©r which way to take, he began to fancy that in all probability Ellen bad found her retreat was not secure, and vainly imagined, that she and her daughter, ap¬ prehensive of approaching danger, had taken the opportunity of flying to Lon¬ don, to put herself under the protec¬ tion of her husband Rosenberg. s3
To London he hastened, only to meet a disappointment that over¬ whelmed him with despair, and to make the worthy Rosenberg partake of the bitter cup of affliction and misfor¬ tune. And what added to the troub¬ led bosom of Edgar was, that the situ¬ ation of affairs was so circumstanced, as to prevent him making the neces¬ sary search himself. Edric declared, he would exert, his utmost efforts to discover where they were; but he could not be spared frora the army for any length of time. However, he hoped that the victory of Shrewsbury would allow them some short time before any new disturha-nee presented itself; and he promised to lose no time in endeavouring to discover the dear fu¬ gitives, assuring his friend, that h&
would send daily dispatches to let hint know of his success. Rosenberg's heart sunk with dread, when informed that Ellen and Elgiva had quitted the retirement Edric had provided for them—an indiscrib¬ able fear robbed him of every hope of happiness and peace; but his dear Edric had promised to seek them wherever they had concealed them¬ selves. He knew Ellen's virtue and affection, and fondly flattered himself slie had retreated from motives of pru¬ dence, and anxiously awaited the ar¬ rival of some messenger to bring him the happy intelligence of their health and safety; and these hopes (though erroneous) helped in some measure to eha^e away despondence* El
Edric, anxious to discover what was become of his loved Elgiva, hastily pursued his journey, eagerly inquiring at every place he passed if they had seen persons answering the descrip¬ tions he gave. Successless were all his efforts; arid, almost broken hearted for their loss, he repaired to his army at Shrewsbury. Grief now obtained her rapid powers over the afflicted Edric, though a youthful conqueror, decked with all the spoils of victory, the smiles of his sovereign, and the affec* tions of the people. Amidst the fa¬ vours that fortune profusely showered on bim, his heart was a prey to grief,
and the oppression of anxiety and thought under which he laboured, was too visible for any one to pass over it unobserved. After staying near three weeks at Shrewsbury, during which time he re¬ ceived a visit from the disconsolate Rosenberg, and his solicitude increas¬ ing, he one evening determined to go again to the collage, and inquire of the old woman if she had heard any thing of the two people he sought. He reached that place in safety; but the answer was what he expected and dreaded—No ; and the distracted Edric was compelled to return without gaining the least satisfactory intelli¬ gence.
As he was just entering a thicket of trees bordering the road side, his thoughts absorbed in melancholy recol¬ lections, rendered still more so, lhat his ill success prevented him from cheering the drooping heart of his friend and father Rosenberg, he was suddenly roused from indulging his distressing pain of tliought, by over¬ hearing a person say, in a low voice, * 4 'Tis he." Rather alarmed, he turned sharply round, and found five or six men close behind him. His single arm would have been of little service had he known their intention. As il was, he could not help himself, for they threw a large wrapper over him, and spon made him their prisoner. , >
Ih vain he asked what was the reason of their violent proceedings; they would return no answ r er. Forced to submit to their arbitrary power of numbers, he was eonveved he knew not where ; one of them remarking in their way, that they had got the fight¬ ing Edric at hist Edric, muffled up and almost sti tied, knew not where they were carrying him to. They seemed to proceed a good way, but in his situa¬ tion he could not ascertain the time, to suppose the distance; but, accord¬ ing to his conjecture, in about half an hour he heard a door unlock, and presently found they were ascending with him.
% 6
Another door was then opened, into which they conveyed him. Then setting him down and taking offthe wrapper, he discovered himself lo be in a kind of prison, for he perceived the windows were strongly barred, and the furniture in the room con¬ firmed the idea. He looked round with surprise and disdain, then asked ik for what reason he was brought there?" " To keep you, sir, from doing further mischief," said one of his con¬ ductors rather impertinently, which rousing the indignant spirit of Edric, he replied, " Mischief!—that seems to be the province of those who com¬ manded me io be brought hither. Pray by what orders am I deprived
of pursuing my road and business in so strange a manner?" " That," replied a second, " we do not think fit to inform you; but you will meet with your deserts, I dare answer for that. I have thus far to inform you—you will be detained here a prisoner for some time, so you may as well endeavour to reconcile yourself to your fate—for being dis¬ satisfied will not mend matters, I can assure you." They then abruptly left him, and secured the door ; where I must leave my readers to judge of the severity of his afflictions, while I return to Ellen and Elgiva at the Castle of St, Egbert.
CHAPTER VIH. So entirely were their bosoms* filled with detestation towards tho TJaron Fitzosric, that thoy determin¬ ed to avoid him as much as vvas in their power. And when hc requested their company next day to dinner, they complained of indisposition, and desired permission to dine in the apartment allotted for them. Fitzosric complied, for his heart was ill at ease—the well known voice of Lady Jane had struck him with dread. Several months had elapsed
since she pronounced her complaining tones, by whieh means he had hoped her spirit rested in peace, and would no more torment him. Alas! how erroneous was the illusion! — She again pronounced how much she had been disappointed in his vowed affec¬ tions, which he had cruelly and trea¬ cherously chosen to break; and he did not wish to see either Ellen or Elgiva, tiil his troubled spirits had acquired their usual calm ; or at least till he could conquer hi* feelings by a dissembled composure. The next day he hunted. The fol¬ low mg, he had a large party to dine with him—they drank freely—and it was late before they parted. Wine chased away the idea of Lady Jane
from his mind ; he was now as happy ns ever. Elgiva had lieard of their merry¬ making ; and hoped, during the ge¬ neral hilarity, to obtain an opportunity of quitting the Castle. For which reason, she left her mother making preparations for their departure, if she should succeed, and ventured down stairs to see if there was a possibility of escaping. The terror she felt for the Baron, inspired her with the desire of leaving his detested roof; and hope flattered her with success, if she embraced the opportunity which now seemed to offer. Bat, unluckily, while she was in the hall, the company broke up, and de-
scended hastily, followed by the Baron, who escorted his friends to the gate of the Castle to take his leave, Elgiva's heart received a severe check in this frustration of her most ardent hopes—and she could not sup¬ press the tears that swelled her over¬ charged bosom, in consequence of the disappointment, a hope so anxiously desired and so unluckily dispelled.— She wished to avoid the Baron ; for she observed by the levity of his man* ner, and some words that dropped from his lips as he parted with his friends, that he had been drinking too freely. Fearftil she could not pass up the great stairs without being seen by Fitz-
osric, and anxious to regain her cham¬ ber, she slid behind a column which led to another part of the Castle, hop¬ ing: to rest unseen. From this hall there was a small staircase whicli she ascended, flattering herself it** would lead to her chamber, as the greatest dread she now endured was the meet¬ ing the Baron. As she reached the top of the stair¬ case, her terror and disappointment iucreased. It led her iuto a gallery- she looked round, and instead of be¬ holding the illuminated gallery lead¬ ing to the splendid apartments usually occupied by Fitzosric and hisfamih, vvas surprised to find only one solitarv Ltmp, suspended to a long iron chain iu the middle of a large Gothic gal-
lery—which gave a very faint light in the midst of so large and dark a place, whereby the surrounding objects were enveloped in a deep gloom. Between the arches, which sup¬ ported a noble cieling were fixed many liandsome pictures, though the faint light allowed her only to view the nearest. She walked up and down the gallery to search for a way out, but could not perceive any; then looking round her with astonishment, she exclaimed, " Good Heaven !— Where am 1 ?" " In the north gallery, near the door of the haunted chamber," replied a voice, which petrified her with ter¬ ror and amazement, and to Kt\e
herself from falling, she rested her arm against the column of a Gothic arch, under which stood a whole length portrait of a young lady, who appeared very beautiful, and was ex¬ ceedingly richly dressed. Elgiva's terror at the reply being made when she saw no creature near ker, almost overcame her, and pre¬ vented her observing the picture till she recovered from her fright. Then fixing her eyes on it, as the first ob¬ ject after her senses returned, she fancied it moved; but, to her great surprise, saw the exact representation of the picture walk slowly across the gallery. Astonishment tied her tongue, and
rivetted ber to the spot—but that astonishment increased, when turning her eyes towards the picture, she per¬ ceived it still remained the same. " What a mystery is this!" said she.—" Could my eyes deceive me ?— Surely I saw the picture raove—but here it remains. — I wonder what it is." " Lady Jane," replied a voice, uttering the name with a heavy sigh. Elgiva was now deprived of the power of speech; she looked fearfully round, but totally unable to move from the spot. The sigh was repeated; long and
dreadfully it echoed through the marble hall. Elgiva's terrors re¬ doubled. A third sigh alarmed her to a degree of horror. She made a violent attempt to speak and move, but could only utter a loud scream, and fell senseless on the pavement. She vvas roused from this state of insensibility by the Baron, vvho had heard her scream, and had followed the sound of her voice to the north gallery; where he found her deprived of sense or motion. He lifted her from the ground with care, and press¬ ing her to his bosom, brought her to herself; and as she opened her eyes h*r terror almost overcame her, on
finding herself supported by the de¬ tested Fitzosric. " Elgiva! Dear Elgiva P' said he, " what could induce you to come to the north gallery?" She was silent—her heart was too full to reply. She dared not reveal the truth, and had not power at that time to make an excuse, or give an evasive answer. 4i You are silent, ray sweet Elgiva," said he ; " tell me, I beseech you, how came you here?" " I missed my way," she replied, 41 1 thought this small staircase led
to my chamber, but I found myseli mistaken." u But why was you so alarmed ?" he said, " Why all that terror ex¬ pressed on your countenance 1 -~ I heard you shriek violently—tell me, my love, what was the cause of your fainting?" <£ Lady Jane" was Elgiva's an¬ swer. Fitzosric started, unable to conceal his surprise, but immediately compos¬ ing his features, said, " Lady Jane ! —but how could she alarm you ?" " Is this her picture, my Lord," said Elgiva, pointing to it
" It is," " 1 saw it move."—Fitzosric trem¬ bled.—" I could not suppress my ter¬ ror." continued Elgiva. " I uttered a wish to know the meaning—a voice, sighing, answered— < Lady Jane!'— I was so much terrified that I fainted awav."' Fitzosric appeared greatly agitat¬ ed, as she related this singular cir¬ cumstance ; but soon overcame his feelings, if he had any that wounded him, and he said, " 1 did not think, Elgiva, you could give way to such childish and romantic notions; it is nonsense all—the errors of a fearful fancy; because you found yourself in the north gallery, and have, I sup- VOL. i. f
pose, heard it related by some of my stupid servants, that that place is haunted. That is the mysterious chamber," pointing to an elegant Gothic doorway ; " that is the dread¬ ful part of the castle of which such amazing reports are in circulation : but let me entreat you, my sweet girl, banish these idle fears, and do not be terrified with imaginary evils. I w ill lead you from heuce, to a place more adapted to your gentle thoughts." So saying, he placed Elgiva's arm within his, and led her reluctantly along the gallery towards the oppo¬ site extremity to the haunted cham¬ ber ; where, pushing a door open, which was covered with green cloth, and before unperceived by her, she
immediately found herself in the illu¬ minated gallery at the top of the great stairs. Surprise, for a few moments, de¬ prived her of the power of making any observations. At length she with- drew her arm, and politely thanked Fitzosric for his kindness in leading her from a place, of which she ac¬ knowledged sJie had lieard strange reports, and said she would no longer trouble him, as she could step forward to her mothers chamber alone. " Your mother is not in her cham¬ ber, Elgiva," said he. " Where then, ray Lord?"
r 2
" Alarmed at your absence, she came to me in the drawing-room, anxious to know where you was, and what detained you. I will conduct you to her," said Fitzosric, taking her hand and pressing it with an eagerness that amazed her, then hurried for¬ ward. " Stop, my Lord Fitzosric," ex¬ claimed Elgiva, " you have passed the drawing-room door." " No matter, my love—never mind the drawing-room." " But my mother, Sir, expects me," said she sternly, and endeavouring to disengage herself from his hold; but the Baron would not allow her to leav e
him. He pressed her with a vvild transport to his bosom, which liberty he saw gave her great offence. Then throwing himself on his knees before her, in humble and tender accents iu- treatcd she would stay and hear him. Elgiva was now more terrified, from the apprehension of real danger from the dreaded and hated Fitzosric, than she before was, at the imagina¬ tion of supernatural appearances; and in her own mind execrated her folly, in being overcome by the fear of illu¬ sive ills, which brought the designing Baron to the north gallery. She saw his eyes exulting in the idea that she was now in his power. 1 h> could not disguise the pleasure he f 3
experienced at the accident which led him to her assistance, while her heart shuddered at the thought—for he no longer appeared the hum ble supplicant; he held her robe with all his strength, and would not suffer her to leave him. " Rise, my Lord," said Elgiva, darting an angry and indignant look at him, " and permit me to retire; this situation and conduct is a dis¬ grace to yourself and me. 1 insist on it that you let me go." <£ But your mother, Elgiva, she expects you in the drawing-room.— How childish and ridiculous are your doubts!"
" It is all an artifice, my Lord Fitzosric—my mother, I am positive, is not in the drawing-room—if she was she would have heard my voice, and would not have permitted you to detain me so long. Once more, I in¬ sist on your releasing me." " I see, Elgiva, you suspect my honor, because you are convinced of the violence of my love," Fitzosric rose from his supplicating attitude, and, without releasing Elgiva, turned and opened a door which led into a bed-chamber, where several ta¬ pers were standing burning on a table. The Baron drew her forcibly towards the door, Elgiva's heart sunk in her bosom with terror—but casting f4
her animated and inquiring blue eyes on Fitzosric, said tremulously— " Whither, my Lord, are you go¬ ing to lead m$V 9 16 To my chamber," replied Fitz¬ osric. " Think not to disappoint my ardent desires—this is an unlooked for opportunity, and I must embrace it.— This night, my lovely girl, I mean you shall share it with me, and to-mor¬ row's dawn shall witness our mar¬ riage." Elgiva started back with horror.— She was equally terrified at her situa¬ tion, and affronted witb the insult she had received ; as also inadequate to express the detestation she suffered
for hira in terms equal to her feelings. At length she indignantly exclaimed —*< Marriage!—Marriage with Fitz- oric!—Oh ! Heaven never ordained that the names of Fitzosric and Elgiva should meet in marriage—and think not, that after this affront, I shall ever look on you but with contempt and detestation." " Wrong not the innocent," was uttered by a voice exactly similar to the voice Elgiva heard in the nortli gallery. Elgiva turned with astonishment, to see whence the voice came, but could perceive no one. Fitzosric trembled, and his counte- f 5
nance changed; but he still clasped Elgiva in bis arms; and seeing how much she was alarmed, ventured to kiss her cheek with the greatest free¬ dom. " Desist!—Desist!"—was uttered by the same voice that spoke before, and immediately the form that alarm¬ ed Elgiva in the north gallery passed before them* The Baron, terror struck, quitted the trembling Elgiva, and supported himself against the door of his cham¬ ber. Elgiva, seeing him so much ap¬ palled, turned and said—" Thus is the guilty punished, and your vile in¬ tentions defeated—the very dead rises to oppose your tyranny and injustice."
And then nimbly ran along the gallery, » and ascended the stairs to her mother's chamber, leaving him mute with ter¬ ror, anger, and disappointment Fitzosric, when he bade his quests good night—heated with wine, and entirely regardless whether he acted right or wrong, heard Elgiva scream, and vvas greatly surprised to find the sound came from the north gallery ; and although it was a place he never cared to enter, yet, hoping to meet Elgiva, he hurried to her assistance, and strove to impress her mind with terrors, that she might the more easily fall into his power; thereby designing to take a mean advantage of her being frightened and defenceless—determin¬ ing in his own mind that she should *6
be the partner of his bed, though what he said with regard to the marriage was farthest from his intentions. But the voice alarmed him, and shook every dormant feeling of his guilty soul; and, to increase his ter¬ ror, the appearance of his unfortunate wife, Lady Jane—for it was her spec¬ tre that so terrified him, frustrated his wicked designs, and gave the charm¬ ing Elgiva liberty to escape. For when no natural power could disarm him of his vile purpose—when the soft per¬ suasions of innocence, in the mild form of Elgiva, could not prevail, the fleeting shade of Lady Jane brought him to a sense, through terror, of what was due to Elgiva and himself; though Jiis return to justice and reason was
but of a short-lived duration. His mind, naturally inclined to gratify every sen¬ sual wish of his heart, soon recovered his usual desires, and he execrated his folly in letting Elgiva escape, when he had such an advantageous oppor¬ tunity of triumphing over her virtue. He now feared that his conduct had given her an alarm—that she might suspect his designs, and avoid him. He now considered how it would be best to act in future ; and determined, the next opportunity that offered, to be more cautious, as at this time his intellects were a little clouded by in¬ ebriety.
CHAPTER IX. Breathless with affright, Elgiva reached her mother's chamber, who had anxiously waited her return, cherishing the flatterer, Hope, during her absence, that the length of time Elgiva staid, was in consequence of having met with the wished for suc¬ cess. But what language can explain the afflicting conflicts that racked the breast of the amiable Ellen, when she heard her daughter s dreadful recital and escape frora the base intentions of
the villainous Fitzosric. Nor did she know how to resent the affront, friend¬ less, unfortunate as they were, pri¬ soners in his castle, deprived of tbe liberty of escaping, and devoted to the power of a wretch, who knew not how to exercise it, unless to oppress the innocent, or gratify his wicked desires : the thought drove her almost to madness. Often did they implore the mercy of Heaven to release them from his tyranny, or to send their be¬ loved Edric, or Rosenberg, to effect their deliverance. Alas ! they little dreamed of the misfortunes that in¬ volved that hapless youth. When morning came, Ellen said, " My Elgiva, I am resolved to see this man. I will insist on quitting St
I£gbert's Castle—for if we suffer our¬ selves to remain here, without notic¬ ing the insult he has offered, it will only give him an opportunity of in¬ sulting us again—he shall see I will resent it. He has no right to detain us. We w r ant nothing of him—for whatever he meant in kindness I re¬ turn him a thousand thanks; but his base conduct sinks him beneath my contempt; and I should think myself contaminated by holding conversation with a man, who has no other sense of honor or hospitality than to crush the persons he has attempted to protect, merely because their situation gives hira the cruel power of being supposed a friend, and under that mask to con¬ ceal the basest designs. I was in hopes I should have thanked him with
real gratitude—but his behaviour has deprived me of expressing them with the sincerity I could have wished, be¬ cause I consider myself very ill treated. How dares he oppose our removal? It astonishes me to thi^k I have so contentedly put up with his vain ex¬ cuses, repeated affronts, and singular ill conduct. He is already up—I hear his voice. Come, we will go together." They descended the stairs, and met the Baron coming from his dress¬ ing-room, who affected not to observe them, as he conjectured Ellen was going to make some complaint; and her natural dignity and persuasively commanding manner alwavs struck
him with sentiments of virtue, awe, and admiration. " My Lord Fitzosric," said Ellen, <c I beg to speak a few words with you. I shall not trespass long on your time, bat I really ranst be heard." ** With pleasure, Madam," said Fitzosric, with a gracious and tender smile, which he could at all times assume whenever he thought neces¬ sary ; and, taking her hand, led her into the dining room. Then turning to Elsiva with a manner of address and a accent which would have made any one believe he was sincere, said, u First, Elgiva, I must entreat your pardon. I ara truly ashamed of my
behaviour last night. I know I de¬ serve not to be forgiven, but my mind had been elated by the cheering smiles of my friends. I must confess that I had overstepped the bounds of pru¬ dence in wine, or I never could have been guilty of so rude behaviour to a person I truly respect I beg you will believe my sincerity, and forgive the effects of my headstrong passions. I do assure you, when I awoke this morning, and recollected my singu¬ larly affronting conduct, I could not rest in peace till I had seen you, and made every acknowledgement for my fault in my power." " Very well, my Lord," said Ellen ; " as you acknowledge your fault I can say no more on that topic; it really is
a very disagreeable one to me, and has caused me great uneasiness/' " What says Elgiva?" said the Baron, tenderly taking her hand, " you are no longer angry, since you find I was not in my senses. I should wish all the wine at the bottom of the sea, if I thought I had offended you past forgiveness." " I forgive you, my Lord, con¬ ditionally," replied Elgiva, without looking at him, " that you never treat me so rudely again ; yet, it makes me admire, that whatever wrong action a gentleman is guilty of, if he acknow¬ ledges himself overcome with wine, he thinks it is a sufficient excuse to cover all his mad actions ; and therefore,
when in that state, he thinks himself authorised to behave as rudely as he pleases ; and what must a person feel, when he comes to his recollection of having been guilty of every wrong while elated with wine. Had you killed me, your being sorry for it this morning would not have restored me to life, or comfort to my mother. In¬ deed, mv Lord, it will not bear an argument. But take the advice of a Aery young person, and guard well your actions, that reason and honor never forsake you." Fitzosric was rather hurt at what *he said, and vowed mentally that she should not escape ; but he would have it one time in his power to resent her having been so free in her thoughts
and advice. However he thought it best to appear well pleased with her remark, and said, " I know it, my sweet Elgiva, and really am of your opinion." " Now, Lord Fitzosric," said Ellen, " you must listen to me, Five weeks I have been in the Castle of St. Egbert, far against my wish, I assure you; though at the same time I feel myself extremely obliged for all your civilities, and the trouble we have put you to. But it is high time for us to return to my own house, which must be in strange confusion duiing my long absence, for we were near a fortnight at the cottage before you re¬ moved us to the Castle. We fled to that place to avoid the scene of battle.
Again, my Lord, I must repeat my thanks for all your favors, and it is my request that I quit the Castle this day." " So suddenly!" exclaimed Fitz¬ osric ; " I shall feel very much at a loss for the happiness I have experi- cenccd in your agreeable company the few weeks you have been at the Castle. But if it is really your desire, you shall be obeyed ; though I must inform you, if you mean to go to Shrewsbury, which I guess by your saying you ilew from the field of battle, I can assure you, you will find it in a state of confusion, as a second battle is hourly expected; though I have nothing to do with it now, for I have sworn fealty to William the Conquo»
ror, and entirely withdrawn myself from the cause I once espoused. How¬ ever, if it is your determination to hazard as much danger as you flew to avoid, I shall say no more. In the afternoon a carriage shall be ready to attend you where you please ; though, I must repeat it, 1 am sorry to part with such agreeable company. We will breakfast together, if you please ; and though vou have been so long in the Castle, I believe you have never seen the beautiful garden that belongs to it. You must excuse my neglect, being for so many years unused to the company of ladies ; and ifl have been wanting in attention and respect, I entreat you will excuse it. We will walk there after breakfast, if agree¬ able."
Ellen readily complied, overjoyed that she had gained her wish so easily, by his promising they should depart; and she only reminded hira to give orders for the carriage to be in readi¬ ness, as she endured great anxiety till she reached her own habitation. Fitzosric assured her her will should be obeyed. They breakfasted —talked of indifferent matters—then walked in the garden. After which Fitzosric went out and Ellen and El- v triva retired to their chamber, elated JO with the pleasing hope of soon bidding adieu to the Castle. Four o'clock came; Ellen began to fear the Baron had behaved so kind, and promised her removal,only todis- VOL. 1. G
arm her of her just resentment; and began to scrutinise his behaviour, re¬ marking every word and look he be¬ stowed on them—and a person we cannot esteem, whom we know to have been guilty of many bad actions, it is natural to doubt their veracity, and convert every action (however trifling) to a fault, whether they de¬ serve it or not; but she had heard sufficient of Fitzosrie's character, to dread lest he still meditated .some de¬ sign against them, and now reallv thought he vvas only imposing on their credulity with an intention to deceive them. While Ellen and Elgiva were speaking concerning the Baron, a man servant knocked at their chamber door,
and said the Baron wished to speak with Ellen. Imagining it was to inform her the carriage was ready, she hesitated not to follow the servant. They descended the stairs. She supposed the Baron was in the usual room—but was a little surprised to find the man turned to the left. " This way, Madam," said the man ; " Ihe Baron waits in the crim¬ son room—follow me." Ellen silently followed—then en¬ tered through an arched doorway that led into a superb gallery, with elegant chambers on each side, and the door immediately closed. At the extremity u2
of this gallery was a spiral staircase, at the foot of which was a door with a beautiful painting upon it. They ascended the stairs, and en¬ tered a handsome neat room, out of which turned another, appropriated as a bedchamber, both richly furnished. " Bless me!" said the servant as he entered, " the Baron is not here—but take a seat, Madam—I will imme¬ diately go and inform him jou wail to see him." Without awaiting her reply, he retreated to the door, and ran swiftly down stairs, closing the door at the bottom with a loud noise. \ Elleirsat a considerable time> won-
dering why Fitzosric did not appear. To amuse herself she walked into the anti-room, and admired the neatness and elegance of the place. Books, music, and various refreshments were in abundance, which rather surprised her; but her thoughts were intent on leaving the Castle, and each lingering minute seemed an age. The sun was near setting—Ellen's impatience at the delay was extreme ; and dreading lest her absence should increase Elgiva's alarm, she descend¬ ed the stairs, determining to seek the Baron, as he had neglected coming to her. But when Ellen reached the bot¬ tom of the stairs, and found the door ."3 3
shut, which the exertion of all her strength could not force open—then every agonizing thought flushed on her tortured imagination, and drove her nearly to distraction. She was now convinced that the specious behaviour of Fitzosric in the morning, was only to lull their suspicions, till he con¬ certed the scheme how he meant to act. Recollecting his conduct to Elgiva the preceding night, she trembled for her safety, firmly believing he had taken this method to separate them, that he might the easier accomplish * his designs. Distracted at the bare supposition of evils, vvhich she dread¬ ed could not be avoided, she sat down on the lower step, and indulged the
most afflicting sensations a w r retch can experience, till a flood of tears gave her full heart relief. Then falling on her knees, with uplifted hands and streaming eyes, implored the Almighty's protection for her Elgiva, and begged its con¬ tinuation for herself, fervently praying till her mind bad acquired a trifling calm, as she cast herself on Providence for protection and comfort. Then, unknowing what to do, returned to the chamber. The sun had been set about half an hour, and the chamber was over* shadowed with the dusk of the even¬ ing—she thought she heard the door at the bottom of the stairs softly un- g 4
locks, and locked again. A few mo¬ ments presented Fitzosric before her, bearing a lamp. Ellen darted on him a look of con¬ tempt and horror ; but being anxious to return to Elgiva, checked the tor¬ rent of anger and resentment that was ready to break from her overcharged heart, as she found herself entirely in his power, in a place where she was confined without a possibility of escap¬ ing, unless it vvas his pleasure. The Baron had seemingly taken pains to habit his figure, which was really a very fine one, to the best ad¬ vantage—he appeared more elegant than she bad ever seen him during her residence in the Cattle. Hc sel his
* lamp on the table, and, throwing him¬ self negligently on a chair by the side of Ellen, thus spoke, " Ellen, your averted eye informs me you are angry with my proceedings. I allow I merit all your displeasure ; conscious of hav¬ ing very highly offended you, 1 seek noi to excuse myself. I come pre¬ pared to bear every angry and unkind vv ord you are pleased to utter. I con¬ fess mv fault—but that fault was in- spired by love." " Lovel" exclaimed Ellen, in a tone of indignation, her heart bursting with grief and resentment—she could not proceed—and turned her head away. " Yes, Ellen, love! From the o5
first hour I saw you my heart has been a stranger to peace. I have been long a widower—there is riot that woman existing for whom I feel that affection which I bear you. Determined at all events to obtain you, I quitted the cause I was engaged in, in order to remove you to the Castle; where I flattered myself I should inspire you with an affection for me, if I could render you any service. Love urged me to delay your quitting it—I in¬ vented excuses and delays, in order to put off your removal, that I might still enjoy the pleasure of your com¬ pany. Your solicitations this morn¬ ing I could not reasonably deny—and by promising to consent to your going away, it allowed me a short time to prevent it—and this is really the truth
which has induced me to act as I have done." " Designing villain!" exclaimed Ellen, " Heaven in its mercy will avenge my cause." " I deserve the appellation, most amiable creature!" replied Fitzosric, " I knew you would reproach me—go on, upbraid me still—call me by what approbrious names you will, still I must adore you, cruel as you are; and therefore, when I confess this, I trust you will believe my sincerity.''^ " And you, ray Lord, believe mine. Your treacherous conduct to me and my daughter, which you have avowed, makes me despise the man that could g6
act with such meanness as to deceive. To hear the name of love prophaned by lips like yours increases my detes¬ tation ; remember your infamous con¬ duct to Elgiva last night, and men¬ tion the name of love no more." ~" Time, Ellen, may inspire you with more favorable sentiments for me ; I can expect only upbraidings at present. My conduct to Elgiva I can fully clear. What I said was in a joke, only to try the vanity of young minds. I am very sorry for it, because I believe I frightened her—but your beauty and elegance claim my ad¬ miration, my respect, my love. Be¬ lieve rae, I am sincere—consent to be the wife of Fitzosric, and my future life shall be devoted to your will."
" My Lord, you must allow me to return to my Elgiva; my heart cannot bear the painful separation ; those few hours to me have been ages of torment." " Give me your promise to let the priest join our hands. When you meet me at the altar, Elgiva shall be restored to you—till then 1 shall de¬ tain her an hostage, till you fulfil my wishes." " Oh ! my Lord," exclaimed Ellen, " torture me not with this cruel deter¬ mination. If you pretend to love me, allow me my Elgiva, the only com¬ fort and happiness ill fortune has not removed from the wretched Ellen."
" But still you withhold the promise I request," said Fitzosric. " How can you, knowing the ardor of my affection, be so unkind ? I have told you my determinatio/j. Consent to meet me at the altar—I will then restore your Elgiva ; but you must endure a sepa¬ ration till then," i( Oh ! never!—never !—never!" exclaimed Ellen, distractedly. " Cruel man!—Leave rae, lest I loath your sight, and forget myself. But, mark me, Ellen and Elgiva are not friend¬ less, and one day you will severely suffer for this. Then, turning from him with an air of scorn, which, al¬ though it humbled the proud heart of the Baron, yet failed not to charm him the more. When, turning round, she
expressively said, " Yes, Fitzosric, thou that hast neither pity, fear, nor remorse, art adequate to the perpetra¬ tion of the v/orst of crimes." Stung to the quick at the conclu¬ sion of her speech, and for once at a loss what to say to appease her anger, he took the opportunity, and slightly wished her a good night; then retired, carefully securing the door at the foot of the staircase; the key of which he took particular care of, and never en¬ trusted it to any one.
CHAPTER X. Fitzosric had in reality confessed the truth. He had undoubtedly a great affection for Ellen, which vvas the principal reason of his using the treacherous means of conveying them to the Castfe. The youth of Elgiva then caught his wandering eye, and when they were both in his power, he knew not where to fix his wavering mind, determining to try his success, and obtain one of them for his mistress. Imagining the youthful heart of El¬ giva (to which period he alw r ays ascribed an insurmountable vanity,
which, I am sorry to say, is conveyed down to the present time) was to be caught by the display of a profusion of wealth and glittering presents, inde- pendant of any kind of affection, he had also the idea, that love, interest, oppression, deceit, or some kind of artifice, would be a means of her falling into his snares, by which idea he thought every female was to be gained, if the man would exert his abilities and dissimulation, and think it worth his trouble to waste his time in the pursuit of making a virtuous woman miserable. In confirmation of Ihe above wretched idea, the virtuous female has no reason to thank a Iale writer* for the contemptuous een-
sures he has past on her sex. But when she considers that he never knew what virtuous attachment was, she will not wonder at the envious manner of his writings, who therefore, in conformity to the malicious ideas of the patrons who supported and encouraged him to write agreeable to their voluptuousness and insensibility, in condemnation of the sex at large. Inspired by these pernicious notions, he has been the miserable means of leading thousands of men into errors, who, from caprice, a little superiority in point of fortune, a small dispute with the persons on w r hom they be¬ stowed their attentions, habitual in¬ tercourse with the most abandoned, or a whimsical, opiniated adherence to the ideas of the gentleman alluded to .
who for the sake of letting the world knqw that they had perused his works, and imbibed his opinions, as also those of a Noble Lord* ; vvhich, how¬ ever, might be the characteristic of some vain and unsettled women in the time hc lived; yet he certainly is not to be applauded forthe malicious sar¬ casms which he extends to all, merely to gratify the humour of the abandon¬ ed characters which he strove, for his own advantage, to please. Unless his pen was exercised to favor the designs of the daring libertine, who, bound by no laws, dared violate the most sacred—and on perusing the latter gen¬ tleman's works, will feel no scrapie in attacking the chastity of his friend's,
or brother's wife, nor the daughter of his most esteemed friend. And the most unfortunate and abandoned pros¬ titute may consider herself in a prin¬ cipal measure indebted to his pernici¬ ous tenets for all the miseries she is doomed to suffer. But to return to my story—I have before related Fitzosric's views with regard to Elgiva. He had first breath¬ ed his passion to her, as Ellen's dig¬ nity of manner awed him iuto submis¬ sion, virtue, and dread, v* henever he saw her, which prevented him from wounding her ears with professions of love, as he really imagined her a superior being to all he had ever met with.
But when he deluded her away from her daughter to a place where he could speak to her entirely alone, then hc thought it a fit opportunity, as she was sinking under anxiety and oppres¬ sion, to take advantage of her un¬ happy situation, and make proposals, which, had she been at liberty, he dared not offer. His heart accused him with injustice, and the little re¬ gard a woman ought to place on the professions of a man, who seeks but to destroy ; and if the unhappy being be¬ comes a victim to his deceitful vows, soon finds herself abandoned to misery and despair. Fitzosric's heart was set on con¬ quering, what he called, the stubborn virtue of Ellen: for, although he felt
a superior attachment for her to every other woman, yet could not his waver¬ ing heart relinquish the libertine pur¬ suits he was engaged in—flattering himself that some how or other she would yield to his entreaties. And though Ellen spoke but little, yet every word she pronounced was like a dag¬ ger to his heart. However, as he was not long of a temper to take these things to heart— virtuous love had not yet gained that ascendancy over him, to make him re¬ solve on relinquishing the fair Elgiva. He silenced the intruding voice of conscience, that represented to him a criminality in declaring an honorable passion for Ellen, while he was pursu¬ ing her daughter with an illicit one.
Therefore he went to seek Elgiva, to frame some excuse (at which he was always ready) for her mother's ab¬ sence. He found her waiting for him in the drawing-room. Terror and asto¬ nishment at her mother's longr absence had induced her to enter his detested presence, to inquire the reason ofher long stay. " Elgiva," said he, u you are the very person I wished to see. I am happy to inform you that your mother is gone from the Castle." " Gone!" exclaimed Elgiva— " Goue! Do not mock me—Do not
trifle with my solicitude. Gone!— Where?—How ?—Impossible!" " Yes," replied he, in an uncon¬ cerned tone of voice, " she is really gone from St Egbert's Castle, if I may be believed. The carriage was waiting—she expressed a desire of going alone, to see if her house and effects were safe, or to procure another ; and she left you to my care and pro¬ tection till she returned, which she promises shall not exceed three dajs." Elgiva's countenance varied alter- nately from a rosy hue to a deadly paleness. Her swollen heart was too full to reply ; it found relief in tears; for she retreated to the wainscot, and,
leaning against it, sobbed audibly, as if her heart would break. Fitzosric, unmoved, allowed her to indulge her grief, fearful of incurring lier just anger, if she should suspect he had bee . guilty of deceiving her. He therefore took her hand respectful¬ ly, and entreated her to be under no manner of apprehension on her mother's account, nor yield to such excessive grief. He begged her to believe the truth of his assertions; and assured her, lhat, in three days, she should cither see or hear from Ellen; which would relieve her mind of every anxious VOL. i. u
doubt, and convince her of his since¬ rity. Elgiva perceived there was no other alternative than to feign a belief of what he asserted, though, in her own mind, she did not believe a word of what lie said. Then, bidding him good night, she, with a heavy heart, retired to her chamber. Fitzosric, overjoyed to find his scheme succeeded so well, soon after want to rest. When Elgiva reached her cham¬ ber, she found Agatha waiting there,
which revived her sorrows. She wept afresh, and, falling on the bosom of Agatha, exclaimed, " Oh! the cruel Baron ! he has robbed me of my dear mother!" " For Heaven's sake, Madam! w hat do you mean ?" said Agatha. " He says she has gone from the Castle, and has left me to his care and protection. Oh ! is that to be believed? Do you think that, after his conduct last night, she would leave me to his care—without so much as telling me Oie was going, or bidding me adieu i Oh! no, no! it is another of his base h2
contrivances! Riches enables him to oppress the innocent; his exalted si¬ tuation in life privileges him to act the tyrant!" " I am so astonished, Madam»" said Agatha, " that lean hardly credit what I hear!" " My life for it!" said Elgiva, in a positive tone, " she has not left tho Castle ; I fear he has imprisoned her, to prevent our leaving him. — Oh ! Agatha! if you only knew the anxiety and distress that dwells in my heart, you would say I was a most wretched creature indeed."
" But what can be done ?" replied Agatha; "how can you be certain she is not gonel Oh! you know not how revengeful the Baron is, if he thinks any one doubts his word when hc has said any thing.—I have seen him in such a rage!" " I defy his rage!" said Elgiva, interrupting her. " As soon as all are asleep in the Castle, I will search every room and place I meet with, but I will discover where he has secreted hen" " Lord bless us! that would be terrible indeed ! I am sure I should be hS
frightened out of my wits!" said Aga¬ tha. " The cause will cure my fright; I shall feel none. Agatha, will you be afraid to go with rae?" " Indeed, I verily believe I could n<rt for all the world ; but I will wait here and pray for you." The Castle clock pronounced the solemn hour of midnight—Elgiva took a lamp, saying *' Well, Agatha, I will not urge you ; mine is a cause wherein I should conquer idle terrors: you, thank Heaveu ! lm\e none of the kind
to afflict you. I will go alone," And she immediately quitted the chamber, to the amazement of Agatha. Elgiva had observed her mother descend the stairs; so she did not imagine she was on the story even with her chamber. She passed the dining room, and nimbly flew by Fitz- osric's bed-room, aud many superb apartments, the doors of which stood open: but, not supposing Ellen was there, wa* at a loss how to proceed; especially as Ethelwald passed her and looked very earnest at her. The sight of him struck her heart with uncom¬ mon dread; for Agatha's account of u i
him made her shudder. She feared he was set by the Baron to be a spy upon her actions ; and her terrors in¬ creased, when he advanced and took the liberty of putting his arm round her waist, whispering at the same time softly— £f I want to speak with you— follow me." The expression of his countenance, which looked very cheer¬ ful, made her fear his villanous inten¬ tions. She had heard he had been the assh antof all his master's crimes. She ieared he was now endeavouring to ensnare her into the Baron's power ; or, perhaps, had dared himself to lift his thoughts to treat her with rudeness and insult; so that, in escaping tf *
Baron, she might fall into the hands of Eihelwald for as evil a purpose. Thus agitated, she disengaged her- <Af with difficulty from his grasp, and ilew up stairs to Agatha; where, re¬ citing what had happened, she was persuaded not to pursue her scheme of -earching the Castle. After waiting some time, and her anxiety increasing to know where her mother was, she again descended the otairs, and passed the various rooms she had before. Fortunately she did not meet with Ethelwald. Entering the gallery on the left hand, then open- II o
ing a door on the right, she found it led into a narrow passage with a door on each side. She opened one of them, and found it to be a kind of lumber room ; for the furniture was all in great confusion. Anxious to see if her mother was there ? she carefully examined every part; but, not discovering the object of her search, retreated, heaving a distress¬ ing sigh, and closed the door after her. The door of the opposite room was fastened; it required all her strength to withdraw the bolts, that apparently
liad not been opened for several years. Hope inspired her with tbe thought that her search would be ended here ; and, acquiring renovated vigour, soon accomplished opening the door* This apartment was large and handsome ; the furniture decaying by the unrelenting hand of Time, and covered with dust, as by its appear¬ ance there did not seem to have been a creature in that room for a great length of time. Elgiva sighed, and her fluttering heart believed the sigh was repeated, though it did not sound like her mother, 11O
and was greatly terrified lest Fitzosric should have heard and followed her. She looked round the room, in hopes of discovering some clue to guide her to the wished-for place that contained Ellen Rosenberg. An hour had elapsed in this un¬ successful search; for the clock had struck one some time, and she des¬ paired of finding her mother. Advancing towards a couch, where she meant to sit a few minutes to rest froim the fatigue, and to give relief to hjer troubled heart by st fresh fit of weeping, her eye rested on the floor
—she perceived it spotted with blood ! Astonished at the sight, she set the lamp on the floor, and, examining it more minutely, saw it was nearly covered. Terrified at a sight that appalled every sense, she was a few moments deprived of sensibility, and sunk extended on the floor. Her recovery brought with it new dread ; and the first idea that struck her aiilicted thoughts, was, that the blood spilled there was occasioned by the murder of Lady Jane; for she re¬ collected hearing Agatha say she feared Lady Jane did not come fairly by her death. *
A curiosity, checked by fear, prompted her to remove the clothes ©f the couch; and, with horror, she perceived they were all dyed with* blood. " Oh! soma dreadful deed has been transacted here," said she.— " Heaven preserve my dear mother from meeting a similar fate!—Inhu¬ man wretch! — how can his guilty heart find rest beneath the roof where¬ in such heinous crimes have been com¬ mitted." When she had removed the clothes, she found the middle of the couch
lifted up. Prompted with the desire of knowing all that related to the mys¬ terious appearance before her eyes, she ventured to open it; but suffered the most agonizing sensations when she perceived it contained the skeleton of a female, thrown carelessly in with the dress on. Elgiva, unable to behold, so unexpectedly, the sight that chilled her soul with horror, fainted away. When she came to herself, she found that in her fall she had extin¬ guished the lamp, and trembled at the horrid thought of being alone in a room where an unhappy creature had suf¬ fered, to all appearance, a most cruel
death. She had not a doubt remain¬ ing but that the uninterred body she saw, was the unfortunate Lady Jane Fitzosric; and fresh detestation in¬ spired her every thought towards the Baron, Then the doubtful fate of her mo¬ ther recurred to her mind. She be¬ lieved Fitzosric to be made up of ar¬ tifice and villany, and could not divest herself of the idea that he had con¬ fined her in some part or other of the Castle. However, she was determined not to relinquish the search she had begun, let it cost what it would ; for she endured such tornjenting thoughts
and such exquisite feelings in the bare apprehension of what might befal her mother, that the sight of the shocking spectacle she had just witnessed scarcely exceeded. The grey tinge of morning beamed in at the shutters. She walked to one of the w indows and opened it, to admit a gleam of light; without which she could not find her way to the door; and the rosy tinge of Aurora, as she waited the progress of the morning, displayed all the horrors of the apart¬ ment more dreadful. She looked to see where the win-
dow opened into, hoping it was to* wards the road; but was disappointed to find it turned towards a garden. The light was now sufficiently strong to enable her to leave tbe dread- fill chamber. Having secured the doors as she found them, she hurried with alt possible speed to her own room: and as she quitted the awful chamber, the Castle clock struck three. Agatha was still anxiously expect¬ ing her return. She perceived by JElgiva's pallid countenance that her mind had received extreme terror. She trembled violently, and had scarce-
ly strength to articulate a syllable. Agatha was greatly alarmed, Elgiva, observing her inquiring eye sought to know the cause ofher distress, said—* " Ah! Agatha, poor Lady Jane was murdered! You were right in the dreadful conjecture. The Baron is a wicked man. Oh! I have been in such a shocking room!—the floor was all over sprinkled with the hlood of that unfortunate Lady!—How I shuddered at the mournful sight, which busy memory will never suffer to be erased from my mind!—and, O Agatha! in a kind of press couch I found a female skeleton. Good Hea-
ven ! What were my feelings at that moment?'* Agatha stood petrified with amaze¬ ment, hardly daring to credit what she heard. Elgiva's distressed counte¬ nance was sufficient to convince her the dreadful tale was true ; then said, iC But have you found your mother ?" "O! nop replied Elgiva, " seek¬ ing for that unfortunate woman I en¬ tered that horrid chamber. The sight overwhelmed me—my light was ex¬ tinguished. Alas! I could not pro¬ ceed."
" I am sure it is a miracle that you did not die with the fright," said Agatha. u Well, after witnessing such a shocking sight, I would advise you to trust to the event; perhaps the Baron said the truth, and she is really gone." '" That idea shall never slacken my Murch, Agatha. I will not be want¬ ing in my duty—the thought that he i» deceiving me is so strongly im¬ pressed on my mind, that I cannot in the lea&t chase it away. I will en¬ deavour to rest myself a little; forthe anxieties and teirors I have under¬ gone the last twelve hours are almost
too much to bear; and as soon as dav a li H le more advances I will renew mv search.'* " I shall remain with you, Madam," said Agatha, " as you are alone— my heart feels for your troubles and disappointments." "As you please, Agatha." They then secured the door, and strove to silence the painful recol¬ lections of what had transpired, by courting the balmy aid of sleep.
CHAPTER Xf. F.lgiva was favoured by a few hours repose, which revived her spirits, and enabled her to bear the distressing sensations her afflicted bosom expe¬ rienced in her pursuit the ensuing day. Having breakfasted, and more fully related to Agatha the mysterious discovery, as she imagined, of the murder of Lady Jane Fitzosric, de¬ clared her intention of devoting the whole day in search after Ellen.
" You will be exposed to many dangers, I fear," said Agatha ; " only consider the number of servants at¬ tending on the Baron ; vou cannot go far before vou are seen." <( You tell me," said Elgiva, 4 that 310 one enters the north gallery. Per¬ haps the Baron, knowing the dread that every one entertains of that place, has confined her there, believing no one will dare venture therein—ami shall terror impede the search 1 am destined to make for my mother ?— No—that shall be the first place I will examine. My soul, Agatha, is now
a stranger to every fear of danger, or any other." " I must confess," replied Agatha, c< there is but one person in the Castle who goes into the north gallery, and that is tho Baron's trusty favorite Ethelwald, the keeper of his secrets— the assistant in all his crimes. And he is the only person who dares ven¬ ture there to light the lamp. I am sure the north gallery might have been in total darkness for me." " And why is the lamp lighted at all, if no person goes into the north galleiy, as yo»j telb hie 1 it might as VOL. I. I
well be in total darkness," said Elgiva. Agatha replied, " I have heard Lady Jane say, that when the spirit of the Danish Lord haunted the Castle, so that no one could live in it, there were a number of Bishops called together to lay it ia the north cham¬ ber; and they expressly ordered a lamp to be lighted in the north gallery every night. It is a ceremony, it seems, that must not be omitted as long as the Castle stands. And I am sure, if the Baron, and all the inhabi¬ tants of the Castle, had not a par¬ ticular dread, that some wonderful
misfortune would befal us if it was omitted, I verily believe the lamp would remain without lighting till doomsday." " What idle notions you are ali seemingly inspired with," said Elgiva; " it makes me wonder how any of you consent to live here. Ethelwald, you say, is the only person whose heart is a little more courageous than his fellows—and he now performs the duty." " Nobody els§ would go. Ber- nulph died suddenly, who used to have t)ie care of the lamp—and we yvera i 2
all happy when Ethelwald offered voluntarily—for every one of us dread¬ ed, lest tbe Baron should order any one particular person to do it I am sure if he had requested such a thing of me, I would have left the Castle that moment. I have often tliought, that the lamp, the nortli gallery, and the haunted chamber was all a mys¬ tery alike*—or did they think, when they ordered it to be lighted, that the ghost of the Danish Lord did not like to be in the dark ?" u WeU,".replied Elgiva, '• since I perceive' the*draadjyou have «of that place, I /will not : request that of you* !
which w r ould apparently wound your feelings, and help to intimidate mine —alone I trust my fortitude will not forsake me; the wish of discovering where my mother is concealed will inspire me with unusual courage.. But to see you trembling with fear and apprehension, if you accompanied me, would banish my resolutions. I charge you, Agatha, if the Baron should come to this apartment, and ask f ■»• me, do not mention where 1 am gone." Elgiva then hastily quitted the chamber. i 8
She first examined all the rooms on .ih$ same floor with her own, though she believed it would be to no purpose^only her own innate satis¬ faction, in the certainty that she had not omitted any place, however feeble the hope. She then descended to proceed to the north gallery. Fearful of being per¬ ceived if she went the way she first did, she recollected the door through which FitzoMic led her the night she was so greatly alarmed, and was happy to find it yielded to her hand. She entered the dreadful gallery
with far different sensations, than those she experienced the night when she found herself in that place, of which such ambiguous tales were spoken. She examined every door that she could open, but found them all de¬ serted and neglected. The noble fur¬ niture was falling into decay; the dust hung in large heavy folds on what had once been elegant tapesfrx, and defaced many beautiful pictures. In one room the casement had fallen from its station, by the rude hand of unrelenting Time, and left it a mansion for owls and daws to build in ; who, as 14
she" opened the door, which had not admitted such a visitor for many years, all set up a loud cry, as if alarmed, and immediately took to flight, shak¬ ing the mouldering fragments about her ears, that she could scarcely see for dust and rubbish. Not imagining her mother to be there, she retreated, and closed the door. She next examined the pictures in the gajlery, and heaved a deep sigh as she contemplated the lovely fea¬ tures of the unfortunate Lady Jane, while the most afflicting sensations
possessed her mind for that Lady^s melancholy fatej as she recollected the unburied body she had found in a distant chamber. : She then came to a winding stair¬ case, on the opposite side, and, de¬ scending, found ! it led into a chapel, tliouo*h, apparently, it had lidt been used as such for many years. And looking at the inscriptions on the monuments, was surprised to find one erected to the memory of Lady Jane Fitzosric. A very amiable character Fitzosric had honored her with on her tomb, representing her an affectionate i 5
wife, a tender mother, a sincere and faithful friend, and an engaging com¬ panion, with every other encomium that an affectionate and afflicted hus¬ band could bestow. " Alas!" exclaimed Elgiva, " what vile pageantry and mockery is here! —A noble tomb—a stately monu¬ ment—an acknowledgment of her vir¬ tues engraved thereon^—when the poor neglected clay is mouldering, un- coffined, unburied, and a spectacle too shocking to behold. Here her hopes were disappointed ;
for when she descended, she fondly flattered herself she should find her mother. A sigh burst from her bo¬ som, and tears chased each other in quick succession down her cheeks, as she hastened to return to the gallery —her bosom filled with greater detes¬ tation towards the Baron than ever she had known before. She had now examined every part of the north gallery, except the mys¬ terious chamber, and there she stop¬ ped. The door was strongly fastened; often she was tempted to open it, hoping to meet with Ellen. But she recollected the prohibition which 1 (>
Agatha said had been laid upon ali¬ as well as that the keys were put away beyond the possibility of dis¬ covering where they were hid—and a kind of superstitious terror overcame her at the thought of entering thai place, and deprived her of tlie emi¬ rate she experienced till now. " Surely my mother," said Mit\ «• cannot be there—I would venture anv thing to be convinced of the cer¬ tainty. The door is strongly secured —the keys no one knows where. Yet should I attempt to open the door of that forbidden apartment, vvhich, for a dreadful reason, has been closed for
so many years, what a train of mis¬ fortunes might ensue !—No—I cannot —dare not enter here. Sacred to the ghost of the Danish Lord, aud surely that of Ladv Jane inhabits it also, else w hv does her spirit wander here ? Poor unfortunate woman ! to fall into such cruel hands 1 Alas 1 I must relinquish all hopes of finding my mother, for this mysterious chamber bars my passage/' Elgiva then with an aching heart returned to her own chamber the way she came. Agatha was there, and dinner had
been waiting for her some time. She sat down to partake of the refresh¬ ments provided, though her heart was disconsolate in not discovering Ellen. Fatigued with her fruitless search, she determined to rest herself till to¬ wards evening, when she meant to renew it. She then related all she had seen to Agatha, and concluded with a wish that she could open the door of the haunted chamber, that she might have the satisfaction of saying she had not left a single place, however dreadful, unexamined.
tk Oh! talk not so," said Agatha, " unless you mean to frighten me out of my senses; for as soon as ever that dreadful door is opened, the ghost of the Danish Lord will be released, and no creature will be able to live in the Castle." " Cease such ridiculous ideas," said Elgiva, pettishly ; but while she chid the fears of Agatha, similar sen* sations crept gently over her mind; and although she spurned the super¬ stitious thought of the Danish Lord's haunting the place, she could not divest herself of terrifying apprehen¬ sions on acconnt of Lady Jane; for
she had seen that mysterious appear¬ ance, and what she saw she had an undoubted right to believe ; she had also heard the plaintive sound of her voice, and knew she vvas indebted to that singular appearance, who as a guardian angel preserved hev from FitzoM'ic's power. These recollections most power¬ fully possessed her mind, and cau.sed her to alleviate the terror she perceived Agatha endure, at the bare imagina¬ tion of the haunted chamber being opened. And assuming as much se¬ renity as could be supposed, she turn¬ ed her eyes on the trembling servant,
and sighing said, <c Be not alarmed, A galha, I will not open the door, though the cause of my curiosity is not an idle one, but most afflicting ; yet I respect the commands of the heads of our re¬ ligion, and lhat mysterious door shall not be opened by mc." Agatha expressed her happiness, that she would not open the door of the north chamber, made several in- quiriei* concerning tho different apart- men Is in that part of the Castle, to which Elgiva minutely replied. * While thev were discoursing the Baron sent a message, to request
Elgiva would favor him with her com¬ pany in the parlour. Elgiva at this moment dreaded the Baron more than ever, there was not a being on earth she wished more to avoid. She also recollected he had drawn her mother from her chamber by a similar specious pretence, and was under the most alarming appre¬ hensions, that he designed to alter her habitation, which would prevent her pursuing her wished-for search. She therefore returned a polite answer by the servant of Fitzosric, and begged she might be permitted to
decline attending him, as the grief she endured at the separation from her amiable mother, had made her ex¬ tremely unwell, and entirely unfit for company or conversation. As soon as the servant withdrew to deliver his message, Agatha said, 16 I am sure, Elgiva, yoa have grieved enough to turn your brain, and what you have seen must naturally increase your unhappiness. Suppose you take a walk in the garden ; the- moon is now rising, and it is a beautiful night; it may calm the agitation of your troubled mind. I know when any thing affects me, I feci my heart ex-
ceedingly relieved by walking out on a fine moonlight night." " I believe I will be advised by you," said Elgiva, " for my head feels as troubled as my heart: but 1 am not acquainted with the garden, therefore if you will accompany me I should be infinitely obliged to you." " With all my heart," replied Agatha; " if you will go, I will juat put the room iu order and follow you ; perhaps you do not know your way, without going down the great stairs, and there you will surely meet th# Baron, But if you pass the stairs, and
proceed as if you were going to the north gallery,on the right hand you will see a chamber, through which you must pas>s, and you will perceive a door on tfie opposite hide—that door, which is of polished oak, will lead you into a part of the Castle, which i dare sup¬ pose you have not yet seen. But if vou wi*»h to see it, I will ^o with vou to-morrow; at present I sincerely be¬ lieve a little air will do you o-ood, for you look shockingly pale. Therefore go down the stair> ihat you will see facing you, and they will take you into the solitary passage that leads to the garden."
Elgiva thanked her, and quitted the chamber, reminding her of her promise to follow.
