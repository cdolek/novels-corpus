THE



WILD IRISH BOY.

To Miss E. St. Clair.

Doiuinick Street, Dublin.

MY DEAR CHILD.

When an old maiden aunt puts on her spectacles, and takes up her pen, it i* said there is no getting her to lay them down. I should he sorry to lay them down without having employed them to some purpose; for the effort has heen sufficiently painful to me. I really do begin to feel the lassitude of old age and seclusion stealing over every part of me, except my affections. These, my dear, are, I think, as strong towards you especially as they have ever been, from the moment that my first tears fell on your orphan face. You were the child of pa

VOL. I. B





rents very dear to me—you are very dear to me yourself—too dear perhaps. My affections should begin to loosen in their hold and interest in earthly things. But of all earthly things, you and your present situation are the most interesting. You have just approached the entrance into life—or, what is called life, that is, a sudden immersion into its worst parts. A few years passed in a convent in France, followed by a few more in a retired part of the country with your uncle and me, ( a clergyman and his sister) and those altogether so few, (you are only sixteen) have formed a contrast rather than a preparation to the life you are entering on— the gaieties of a city in its gay season.

My dear, do not construe this into a childish solicitude about inferior objects; I am not going to give you a lecture about early hours and flannel petticoats.

Oh! my dear child, my hopes and fears about you have never been satisfied with the objects of this life: Could I be so, I should have little to dread* When I look at you, I see youth, feeling, genius, and—no, not beauty—but something ten thousand times better than beauty in the eyes of men—and women too. But then there is a balance—a fatal balance to all this—a modern designer would make it the brightest tint in the piece—in my eyes it is the only shade.





You have a terrible portion of what is called, I believe, sensibility, by people whose business is to teach us to "commit the oldest sins the newest kind of ways"*' different writers will give different definitions of this quality.

An old maiden aunt I fear would call it—an habitual misapplication of the good and evil of life—a rejection of the good, till the good has departed— and a contempt of the evil, till the evil has arrived. 1 am not speaking of this quality exercised on the trivial parts of life--B %





on such its exercise is tcazing but harmless; a sentimental miss may be allowed tp lavish away her agonies on dead butterflies and dying canaries, and perhaps it is well for others as well as herself that she does so. But the quality I refer to, is rarely content with such sacrifices. It will extend its influence to the most important pails of life, it will determine us in our choice of happiness—or of misery.

I know the progress of this business— I can tell (I trust not foretell to you) every stage of it—-it begins by adopting a certain mode of reasoning and feeling of its own, which, by some intuitive sense of right, it discovers to be the most exquisite and felicitous that can be devised; it then proceeds to apply this high strain of thinking and acting, to the ordinary events of life. The history of its internal feelings furnishes it with the narrative of romance, nor will the narrative be long without an hero. Life now as'





sumes the unalterable complexion of confirmed error—creation has but one bright spot, one spot like the garden of Eden; all the rest is a waste wilderness. Human nature presents but one object to the view, all the rest of mankind glide like shadows before the mental and bodily eye: But from this golden age, there is an instant transition to the iron.

This state of things cannot continue long-*- characters and feelings, unnaturally ttrctehed on this sentimental bed of torture, must return with violence to their natural tone and dimensions. The hero or heroine, the idol of romantic passion, is discovered in some unlucky moment of common sense or common life, to be the last thing their worshipper would wish the idol to be found—an human being; to have pa^.ons and infirmities, and wants utterly. unprovided for by the statutes of romance. Perhapi, what is still more afflicting, the person,





who has indulged this fatal state of feeling, discovers a certain defection in hit own powers of living beyond human life, a certain sensibility of common evils, and a subjection to common accidents, to ill-health and misfortune, and indigence, that "sickles o'er" the rich colourings of passion, with the pale cast of humanity.

The consequences are dreadful; a total and hopeless dejection overshadows the mind: it is not as in other cases, where a discovery of deception is a security against future evil: no, all discovery is ioo late, it cannot renew a broken frame of mind, as it cannot repair the ruined fabric of life and happiness, over whose fragments it is yet more delightful to the sufferer to linger and wail, than to erect ad humbler and safer structure of materials, such as common life supplies, and such as afford comfort and shelter to





those who expect no more from any "earthly habitation."

Comfort is yet perhaps in their powerA but comfort they have always despised., and those that sought it, and their contempt is now aggravated by that natural pride of disappointment, that scorns to divide or palliate evil. Rapture or despair was their choice of life, and their choice seldom leaves them more than the latter alternative. The rest of life is wasted in fretful repinings, or solitary gloom, in unpitied complaints of evils of which they will not see the cause, in a black and splenetic deprecation of life in which they will see no good, because it did not afford them that good which it cannot afford to man.

But example is said to be more powerful than precept: I will give you an example the most in my memory and conviction—I mean my own. At an age when I had at least the beauty of youth (fifty years ago ) I received my first proposal; it was from a gentleman who wooed me like a man and a Christian. He talked of life as having many toils and trials, he said he wished to have a companion in the one, and a support under the other; that his temper had many infirmities, nor did he believe mine to be without them, all human tempers had them; that he expected no supernatural heart and character from the influence of passion, no transformation of life into a "primrose path of dalliance" by the magic of fan^ tasy. But, he said, he expected a gradual and benignant amelioration of life, from mutual instances of sacrificed selfishness; from the progress of confidence, from the memory of kindness, and the habits of affection; above all, from the influence of religion, which he described as having power like the prophet's wand 'to heal the waters of bitterness with which life overflows. I acknowledge I





hoard him with disgust—perhaps, because my sense of hearing and all my other senses had been perverted by a young man, who had at least enough to please the eye and the ear, that loved to listen to romance—I cannot exactly remember the style in which it was usual for men to talk to women sixty years ago, but I know it was not in that cold anatomical way of love-making which seems the fashion of this philosophic age. My favoured lover had no fortune, but he spoke so eloquently of the stimulus, and the support that passion gives to industry, of the chearfulness of his toils, of the delight of success, or the consolation of disappointment, that I hardly thought I had any merit in sacrificing the promise of life to the invitations of a passion so pure and lofty; so much what 1 lultt taught myself to expect, and had baen told I could inspire.

He went to London (for I then lived B a





in England) to engage in business, to which he had strong recommendations, and I remained in the country, content for his sake with celibacy and loneliness, with suspended expectations, and visions of happiness. I acquit him of any intention to impose on me, but he had been too successful in imposing on himself. His prospects were open and promising, but he neglected and dismissed them; it was so delightful to have a hoard of sentimental misery, to talk of the pangs of separation, and the lingerings of happiness, that he could not persuade himself to adopt any effort to extricate himself from a situation of such genuine and approved distress. He talked of the toil he would undergo, with his arms folded, and his papers and desk buried in dust; he talked of the happiness to which he was aspiring, but confined his aspiration to wishes, and sighs, and letters. In the mean time he was not without other





objects of regard; many women loved to listen to the language he had spoken to me, and he loved to speak it to every woman. He forgot one who was withering L. away in solitude for his sake, without a reproach, and without a distrust of him. This state of things could not long continue—in the sweet lapse of sentiment (his favourite phrase) he was impelled to the arms of the wife of the man who had been bis friend and benefactor, in whose house he lived, and whose affection and confidence, and bread, he shared. His der tection was easy; his character and fortunes were now destroyed; he fled to France, the guilty wife followed him; they struggled through many years of indigence and squalid wretchedness, and died in beggary.

For some years I wished myself— Tvbere they were before me—I had little tie to life—my health was destroyed, my spirits crushed: I was iu the wane of life, without the possibility from external as well as internal causes, to form another connection, to lay hold on another stay for my deceived and tottering steps. I had but one motive to live- it was to atone to the author of life, for the criminal abuse of its best part, for thepreversion of gifts, which, had I learnt the usesof them from religion, would have engaged his approbation, and secured my own felicity. The power that taught me this, taught me also the value of what remained. About this time your uncle, who was my favourite brother, was promoted to a deaiiry in Ireland, and invited me to that country with him. I did not despise the happiness that was yet within my reach; I sought it in tranquillity and retirement, in the scrutiny of my conscience, and the purification of my heart. In these I have found a peace which the world cannot give.





I was compelled to break oft*—my feelings have been elevated, but not above humanity; yet you are perhaps at this part of my letter, demanding why I harass your feelings and my own, by an exhibition of distress which you neither fear nor deserve; you are asking what reason can there be for apprehensions which nothing relating to you has yet suggested. Ah! my dear, every thing relating to you suggests an apprchensiou tome—^our frame and habits of mind, your studies, your early solitude, and sudden transition to a scene of glare and gaiety, your being of the Romish religion (a religion which I fear allows too much of the language of passion to its professors)—but we are never to look to the prominent features of life for the causes of the events that occur in it. We are all weak local creatures, perpetually excited by trifles, and pursuing names of things, not things themselves. I confess I dread more than all I have mentioned jour orphan state, and the mystery that hangs over your birth, a mystery so congenial to a romantic mind, -which loves to believe that life, from its commencement, has been marked with select and uncommon features in their behalf. I ever dread the romantic name your mother gave you, which though I suppose common in France, no one in this country can hear without believing herself more than half the heroine of a tale. I am full of this subject, but I will try rather to say what ought to be said, than can be said.





Whatever tempts you to act in the greater emergencies of life, from impulse rather than deliberation, must be wrong. I must here* insert a passage from your uncle's last sermon. He 'was speaking of the modern philosophy—" The distribution it makes of the different powers of the mind, appears eminently injudicious—it inverts the





places both of feeling and reason— reason appears assigned to man to be exercised at leisure, to assist him in a deliberate comparison of things, and enable him to determine his preference or rejection of them. While feeling appears allowed him, to interfere in those cases where to consult reason is impossible from haste or from emotion, and suggest, with a promptitude and energy which the occasion demands, that conclusion which a balance of opposite probabilities would suggest, were there time for such a balance. Life abounds with such cases; no man has time for debate amid the rage of a volcano, or the horror of a siege—on such an occasion, to act from the impulse of the moment, under its most sudden and arbitrary suggestions, is to act justifiably and rationally.

"Butthe modern philosophy, like MoHere's physician, has 'changed all that now.' We sire to adopt feeling as our guide in the greater movements of life; and we are to reason on the most minute events, and the most abrupt emergencies.





"In the choice of a companion for life, in the choice of a mode of subsistence, nay, in the choice of life or death itself, we are to abandon ourselves to an impulse, we are to consult a momentary feeling, which, according to their account, is also the result of the mean and mechanical causes, of the air we breathe, or the last meal we have eaten, or the last object that has given a motion to our animal spirits. . While he who assists the sufferers in a burning house, is to pause and reason on the steps of the ladder, whether the life he preserves be of more consequence than that he neglects, whether he ought to throw back into the flames the infant he has just snatched, and inquire whether there be any possessor of an enlightened mind in the same danger, whose preser





vation from it would contribute tj the 'general good."

Now to quit your uncle's sermon, and pursue my. own. Whatever tempts you to believe that the 1 aw* qf nature and society can be repealed in your case,and that the peculiar state of your feelings, &<\ furnishes you with a dispensation for their infringement, is wrong. Whatever leads you to believe that the obvious and permanent duties of life may be superseded in your case by the intervention pf some extrinsic and temporary appeal to your - feelings; that to be a relative or a friend, is less important than to be the heroine of the moment, must be wrong.

Whatever leads you to^ believe that the desire of unattainable .happiness should become the fixed passion of your life; and that its rich, fantastic misery is a balance for the sacrifice of rational

enjoyment "<

I will add no more, except that 1 beT lieve all lessons of human wisdom art vain, all power of human conviction, weak and unproductive: When I had you with me, "I showed unto you a more excellent way."





May you never mistake or forget it. My dear child, while I hut write these words, my eyes, which are none of the clearest, grow too dim to write any more; and my hand, which at seventy-six may be unsteady, is too tremulous to hold my pen.

JANE ST. CLAIR.

P. S. Don't answer me, my dear, I did not write to be answered—but let nothing interrupt your correspondence with your cousin Martha Gore; she is one for whom I have the greatest regard; she is the daughter of the man whose addresses my folly rejected, who afterwards married my younger sister, with whom she lived many years of rational happiness and progressive esteem. There is about jour cousin Martha, a facility, a placid and pliant spirit, that eminently qualifies her for a confidant and correspondent. I am an old woman, weak and irritable, aad querulous; but she is all concession and gentleness, though her concessions never are extended to her principles, and her gentleness never debilitates her understanding.





Deanry, November 18. N. B. Pray do not forget mine and the dean's best compliments to your guardian and his family, and inform him, that when you return in the summer to us, it will give us pleasure to see you accompanied by any of his family, who can bear to domesticate with a country divine, and an old maiden aunt.





7b Mrs. M. G—re.

I Have received a letter from the cbuntry, full of advice, "excellent good advice."—My poor, kind, deceived aunt! She tell me, that-—she tells me -what it is now too late to tell, and what, if told earlier, would have been perhapj in vain. There is nothing that wrings my heart more than the feeling of being beyond the advice and wishes of the good, of the hopes and fears of affection, all that touches or ameliorates the heart being of no avail to you; of being beyond the prayers of a friend, and obliged to listen to all that can be said with conviction and despair. I could not avoid answering her. In my letter I ventured on my first deliberate falsehood. I assured her I was quite tranquil and happy. It was better that I should deceive her than Besides we all mean, different things by happiness. If it be happiness-to me to sit for hours alone at my window, watching nothing; if it be happiness to me to be much alone, to think, and to weep, or smile more hopelessly than I weep; if it be happiness to talk to no one, and, when none can hear, to wish for nothing more- in life than solitude, for nothing more in thought than a dream; if it be happiness to me to be what the world calls wretched, but what the few who feel it would .not change for the world's happiness, to live upon the sweet, sweet poison of dejected fancies: if this be happiness, I may be happy.





But how can we talk of happiness, when the sufferings of those around us can disturb and make us wretched?

There are some characters, situations I mean, that have a power of exciting solicitude even to misery, to misery such as I never could feel for mvself. I





have conceived a character that I wish had never existed—a young, a very young person, almost a boy, with the form of a girl, and the feelings of a man; no, not of a man, with more modesty, more freshness, more retirement and timidity, and youthfulness of mind, than men, men in the world, can have. How fair, Oh! how fair, beyond the promises of humanity, are the promises of such a life; and, at its very entrance, ardent in untried sensibility, and profuse of affections that seem given in excess, to meet with the usual events and characters, the common train of temptation and vice, the weak and the worthless, and the debasing society, but which tempts the young wanderer with the Circe-cup of riot and transformation; one to whom the call to pleasure sounds like the call of friendship, who follows the invitation of vice, because he loves the friendliness of its tone; who is betrayed by the very

2





affections that promised him happiness, because he trusted without suspicion, and loved without defect; and such a one, Bo soft, so warm, so touching from contrasted virtues, and ill-suited circumstances; trusting with such helplessness, and yet feeling with such force and fire; submitting to vice, yet aspiring after virtue; unwillingly undone, and bearing the melancholy splendor of his original brightness through cloud and mist.

And he might have been so happy, and they might have had other victims. There are so many common-place heads and hearts, who would never have betrayed the struggle of grace and passion, never would have been disfigured with the wreck of worth, and the spoils of a lovely nature. Is it possible to think of such a one without .... I will not see his ruin; no, that I am resolved on, I could not witness his utter ruin. I will hide myself in some convent, some convent in Dublin, where local thoughts will mingle with my prayers, and soothe my mind, for it is touched to the quick. Oh! there is such a consolation in the offices of our religion; it is no cold, abstract, "reasonable service." We may clasp our saint's images, and kiss their pictures, with strong human feeling. We can strain our burning eyelids and forehead to cold refreshing stone, and waste the throbbings of an heart, whose pulse is too quick, against the relic and the shrine. We can say in the moment of human agony, "My saint will have mercy on me, she has been human like me, like nie she has been tempted, she knows all that is within my heart, all that I dare not know myself, she will lean from rest to listen to me, and to intercede for me.





ELMAIDE ST. CLAIR





You know all—-yes, you must know all—I could not expect to escape a female correspondent. But there were expressions in my last Foolish letter, that did not require a female reader to construe. But now, Martha, let it be &a something you had never known, or were determined to forget, for ever. Let us speak of it as of things past and gone by, determined and desperate, not to be recalled or debated on; let us speak of it as the widow who had pined for years would speak of the subject of her sorrows, beyond grief and fondness for ever. Do not ask me why I speak in this tone of resolute misery. I have seee him, and have felt that the complexion of life is determined. But he has seen me, and has felt, as if he looked on vacancy; and it is better, much better so. .1 can hardly bear his sight, I could not bear his voice speaking to use ; 'his rich and angel tones would madden roe: no, I cannot woo

him. I will hide myself in the solitude of pride and despair. Perhaps when he treads on my grave, he may pause, he may ask—oh ! let- him not, let him not; shall I not rest in a grave ?--No, Martha, no, I sec all, nor am I unwilling to see it. There is no hope for me, but the despair that the fancy-sick mind loves more than hope. He is not to be thought of, but in my dreams. You must have heard of him; all Dublin rings with his extravagance, and his dissoluteness, and his beauty.

I heard, when I first came to Dublin, of the nephew and heir of the old Milesian chieftain De Lacy, who resides in a castle in the wild, western extremities of Ireland. I know not why he sent him here to blaze out life in early vice, for he is said to despise modern splendour, and modern folly; and lest youth and extravagance might fail of excess, lest his heart might prevail over his circum





fiances, they have sent with him a com* panion, another nephew of the chieftain, whose.commission is, I believe, to be " a guide to vice:" at least it is one that he discharges with dreadful fidelity to this unhappy boy.

He is much older, and has the bold, broad front of unredeemed depravity. I heard of the groupe when I first came. I wish I had never seen him.' The first day I saw him, he was springing into his curricle, but he sprung from it again to raise a beggar who had tottered as he rushed by him.—I wish I had never seen him.

ELMAIDE ST. CLAIR.

To Mrs. M. G.

No, Martha, give me no advice, it is too good for me; I solemnly acquit you of any more offices of friendship to one who will be undone; who lives on dreams, and loves despair. If you caw give me any consolation—but that is impossible. Do you observe a more strong and tenacious tone in the style of this letter? strange to say, it has been the effect of joy—yes, of joy, you must be prepared for the caprices of passion. This has been a day of such rich and remembered indulgence, that it requires the balance of reviewing my state to support it. I saw him twice, and once I was so near him—Martha, I will tell you all—no, not all; I cannot tell what I felt when I saw him at a distance. He so often passes me in the whirl of a phaeton, that before the mist is dispersed which his sight always clouds my eyes with, he is gone. But he was walking — and alone. I could fix my eyes on him while dim and remote, and learn to gaze though he was approaching, and just when he was too near for pleasure, when l grew sick with too much love; he turn





ed aside to some carriage that had stopped ; some happy hand beckoned to him from the window, and he leant against itr and conversed with the owner; then I passed him, and I did not see that exquisite fold of his limbs, and the profile his rich locks shaded so richly. I.c did not see me—no, and it gave me a strange joy that he did not; for passion is fond of wayward devices, of induj-* gence, and pain. After that, I cou'd not go home. There was a spell in the streets that kept my spirit wandering in their circle; for the triflers with me, trifling excuses were sufficient; they wondered at my spirits, and I wondered at their serenity.

But, oh I Martha, the second time— I had not time to drag down my veil, or do any thing but stand breathless.

He was so near, that he touched me; yes, touched me; I shivered, and felt it —for ever. What is that thick and thrilling sensation, that the touch only can give, that virtue which the garment can communicate ? I can hear to meet his eye, were it half withdrawn, or shaded hy the eye-lid I could 'gaze on it for ever; but the touch must be felt but once in life—Could he have felt me tremble J^-He turned, that - was too much. I felt his hyacinth breath on me ;1 could have counted the hair that played' on his cheek, it was so near. I am at home now, and alone, but how l cannotremember





Que in the Morning.

I am just returned from the theatre; indulgence makes us bold. I joined the family going there, because I thought— I will not tell you what I thought. Why is there always about a theatre^; a kind of daring levity, of allowed and familiar looseness, more than about any other assembly? The men go back and forwards ia.





the dress of the morning, and appear employed in any thing but the employment of the place. I know not why, but I always feel myself less timid, less cold,. less a female in this place than in any other. The glare, and the heat, and the noise, harden the senses^ perhaps inflame them, perhaps—no matter for the philosophy of a theatre. From the moment I entered, I felt an expectation which I knew would be realized. The intelligences of love .are unerring. He entered about the third act, like one who had risen from a late irksome dinner; his eheek was dark, and his eye restless. I looked at him with fondness and agony. In a few moments he quitted the opposite side of the house, and came into the very box where I was sitting. He knew some one on the row behind me, and she took Ojfrre that her knowledge of him should be observed. He is a thing to make a.woman vain. How could she speak so

A





at her ease, while I could hardly breathe from the moment I felt his presence—felt —for I dared not s^e him. I could neither turn nor look. I was as one watching the sleep of enchantment which a motion would break. There is- no pleasure in having him so very near; it is a state too breathless, and fearful, and exquisite. But to watch for the tones which broke upon the idle noise about me from time to time, like the song of the waterspirit amid the bubble of the brook; to watch for those indistinct sounds from which I tried to guess his motions, and think whether we leant against the same partition—this, and a thousand devices of joy and pain I practised, till the lady talked, as women will talk, something of love. His voice changed in a moment, his words were few and broken, and hardly articulate, and I dared not look at him then; but though I did not see, I knew that his eyes were depressed., and his head bowed.





It was a strange moment; I know not whether it was joy or miserj' to me to feci that—perhaps he loved.

It was but a moment. That odious Beloraine came into the box, and spoke to him in a certain tone, which he seemed to catch directly—yet still I tried to think reluctantly. I tried to think its loudness and laugh were forced. Deloraine drew him into another box among a number of young men; and I was happier, for then unseen I could see sometimes the motion of his arm as he leant against the pillar ,once I beheld the undulation of his rich red lip, as he spoke to some one; some one who heard him, perhaps, as he would have listened to the wind. '-'

They never loved who wished to be near What they loved. Werter talks of danci**g! With Ckarlotte, of holding her in his arms; what feelings men have! Such a time is with me, a time of fear and blindness. I love to be so far from





1

him, that it is requisite for me to watch? and devise how E may catch a glance or a tone'from him.. I would not be nearer if I might; a glance, a tone is enough, is too much for me; "A touch is," as Alonzo says,, to be bought with life'." Why, will he speak, in those soft tones, 1 and yet speak, nothing but lightness? why will he mingle with those beings, and be still so, unlike them? I wish he would be either angel or human*, and I might then, have peace.. But. this, mixture of loveliness and; depravity,, this, beauty and;brightness of a fallen, angel, so rends my feelings, so- confounds my, mind—what principles I have left, are so. shaken and shattered, that I wish.I, were, dead, to be shut out from pain..

Odious Deloraine wouldnctlet him rest long; he whispered him again, and they left, the box together, yet I thought he went unwillingly, I thought I heard him sigh^ He went; and I could not rush and; recall him, I could not speak, I could not interpose even a look—a look might have done it; he is so young, so timid in vice, of so sweet and auspicious a nature— surely the saints will pardon him. Twice they told me it was all over, it had been alt over with me before. As we went out,. he was lounging near the lobby fire, in an attitude of studied boldness; I am. sure it was studied. It was a form to make libertinism lovely, therefore I tried to hurry away from him; But to be from him. is impossible. I am now alone, with the images of the night before my eyes, and the restlessness of dissipation in my head. If he loves— but why. do I rave? He ought to love, love purifies the heart it is said; but what purifies the heart of man, may keak that of woman..





ELMAIDE ST. CLAI1C.





heart which moulders there was broken for his love, that the hovering spirit would be absolved by his sigh—all this must be, and it is my pride that all this must be; for worlds I would not that he knew I loved. If I were unworthy off him, I could have no consolation; if I were so lost, I could not pray for his soul..

If I am guilty, my punishment will not be long deferred.. They say he is a* gamester now, that he is engaged in a desperate bet with some of the most desperate of the set at D—ly's, about racing or gaming; I could not hear the particulars. This must be odious Deloraine's doing.

ELMAIDE ST. CLAIR.

Martha, I do kneel and pray;: I do struggle with my heart, and weep that the struggle is Bo vain. There is an. Jiollowness and duplicity in my feelings which distract me to discover. But of what avail would the firmest resolution be to me? the power that enslaves me is not within me; I cannot make it cease, if I wished. B.ut to feel all my good resolutions and wishes, the whole pile of determined amendment, that the tears and prayers of a penitential night seem to have raised, the calm of mind that is sometimes produced by weariness of woe, to feel all this overthrown and scattered by a single glimpse of his form, by the Tery dream of his shadow, when I close my eyes, and see darkness filled with flitting forms, to think that the very depths of my heart are unable to shelter me from his eye, even if I sought shelter,, to feel in the very moment and spirit of supplication, while my Hps are pouring out the most solemn sounds—I am "confessed within the slave of love, and BJan."—to feel this, is to feel myself so-lost, so hopeless, that despair almost becomes a refuge, that I am glad to sink under the waters, to lose the noise of their roar.





It is a dreadful state of mind, when real objects become visionary, and visionary ones, realities.

All life appears to me a dream—I move like a shadow among those whom I see, and they are as shadows to me. But his presence seems always real; his thought seems the purpose of life. But it is to no purpose that I think of him.

Why do they talk to me of his dissolute courses—he is more innocent than any that speak of him. He cannot be what they say of him, or if he be, he cannot err as others would err; the heart and the motive are what they cannot penetrate, or they would know that his have nothing to do with the vices forced on him: yet let them talk of him still, for they mention his name to me, and that





'name tells them of nothing more than any other sound they utter ; it does not remind them of a cheek whose colour is like the stain of ripe fruit on marble, of an eye from which when he shakes his clustering ringlets, 1 am sick with brightness, and with them veiled "again. There are two lines of an old Irish song, which perhaps will make you smile, but which have made me weep from the thoughts of him,

His eye is like light in the morning's blue stream,

And his chrek is like strawberries smothered in cream.



Did I ever try to describe his person to you.

I never will attempt it again. ; . E. St. Clair^

To Mrs. G—re. »

Now I know all, I know the worst, or best; no matter which to me. He is in love; he loves, I knew he loved; from the moment I first beheld his melancholy eye, first heard his suppressed tones, like sweet, broken music; first saw his form, which the very spirit of love seems to have touched with a kind of luxuriant' sadness, to have poureda mild and mellow light around, an halo of melancholy brightness; I knew he loved; such a being was only formed for love.





He is undone, his ruin could not be more certainly sealed- than by such a passion. And so young, and so innocent; "oh the pity of it." But how was it possible for him to escape? Youmusthave heard of Lady Montievor, the modern Ninon, "who has filled the throne of fashion," and fashionable folly and vice,. Without an equal or rival, till her reign: was extended over subjects; of a second generation, whose beauty has triumphed over nature, and whose wit is unimpaired by time, whose sous have entered into public life, whose daughters have married, whose grand children form a numerous family already, and whose beauty is still as distant from decline as from competition.





Always living in the blaze of courts, and in the centre of splendid admiration, her form and manners present the reflection of all that is attractive in grace, of> resistless in power, all the art of beauty, and all the array of fascination. And in the midst of her triumph and her power, in the luxuriance of magnificence, and the pomp of loveliness, when her family had extended their alliances through the first houses in Great Britain, and her influence was solicited by courtiers and senators, the discovery of the legitimate heir to the title and fortunes of the earldom of Westhampton, which had been usurped by her lord for thirty years, suddenly dashed them into indigence and infamy. They retired with all that remained to them, the title of Montvevor, and an impoverished income, to their estates in Ireland, where they hid, with their pride and their shame, the remains of their family and the ruin of their fortune. The circumstances that transspired on an examination of this dark business before a committee of the house of lords, were so atrocious, that Lord Montrevor is said to have owed his retirement to the influence of his lady, whose magnanimity, in sheltering and sustaining in his disgrace an husband whom in prosperity she had despised and neglected, and it is said injured, shed a gleam of dignity over the close of a life of levity and vice, a magnanimity the more gratuitous, as it appeared she was utterl) ignorant of the iniquity by which ber distinction had been acquired, and that Lord Westhampton, convinced of her innocence, had made her the most liberal offers by way of compensation for





the losses she sustained by the recognition of his title.

But whether she felt the decline of her attractions, or her thirst oft power, or spirit of pleasure, she rejected every exclusive provision, and accompanied her husband and the children who were yet unsettled, to the wilds of Ireland, where he employs himself in dreams of recovered rank and influence, and she in deriding them; for though she follows him with tenacious fidelity, she still reserves to herself the right of ridicule and reproach, which she exerciseswithout mercy—such is the newspaper account of this extraordinary woman.

He has seen her. The castle of De Lacy is near the seat of the Mrntrevor family. He saw her, and it is but necessary to see her, that all other objects may become indifferent; it is easy to tell the effect of an interview between a wild Irish boy and a veteran woman of fashion, so interesting in the softness of retirement, and the dignity of solitary beauty. He is undone, yes, I repeat it, he is undon#. Nothing is so fatal to the mind as thedespair of early passion aggravated by the consciousness of guilt, and the constraint of disappointment. I feel it by mysfelf. From the first moment I beheld him, I knew he loved, that his love Was hopeless, and that is was guilty. His face tells it all, but oh! tells it with an expression which divests despair of gloom; and guilt of criminality. He is undone, but who can wonder at him, or at her, fevered with dissipation, and wearied with the insipid forms of fashion, what he must have appeared to her, so fresh a form, so young a mind, a single star of young morning brightness in the dark waste that surrounds her now. They say she is still beautiful as ever. She must be resistless; and alone, all around her so rude aud savage, and solitary, a Ca*





lypso on a desert shore—she must be resistless! and to see her in the melancholy of departed grandeur, and the majesty of voluntary retirement, her misfortunes, and her seclusion veiling the glare of her manners, and softening the loud tones of her wit and vanity, to the docile and piano of conference, to a whispered spell of languishment and seduction, a shadowy splendour like moonlight hanging over the rich and faded colours of her beauty—yes, yes, I can imagine it all, she must be resistless. Cruel woman! in the sport of her vanity, in the spleen of her solitude, she will trifle with what a fonder heart is breaking for; she will treat him as a boy, be will love her like a man. When he finds he is abused, in the conflict of pride and love, he will rush into dissoluteness, or sink into dejection. His heart will be depraved or broken, his noble gentle heart—but mine will be cold first. Cruel woman! she might have been content with the wreaths of conquest she had gathered in all the courts of Europe, without coming to the wilds of Ireland, to tear my wild-briar-rose from me—from me, now wild. I am not fit to be the handmaid of her he loves. I am no high-born beauty, splendid and fascinating, with melody in my voice, and magic in my smile; but if my cheek is pale, I would he knew it is for love of him—again myself; it is a wild and wayward -thought, like a thought of love; yet I cannot but sometimes dreamthat I would not have been so far from hope, if he had never seen that splendid Jady.





'E. ST. CiAlE.

His habits are desperate; it is the despair of love, vice is not natural to him. He is much talked of, they distract me by their condemnation and pity of him. He was not framed for their pity. But they soothe me by unmingled ex-ecrations of Deloraine; all agree, that when his influence is suspended, when his mind regains its natural direction,- its habits are so gentle, so domestic, even to melancholy and solitariness, he will abandon his present courses. Then they talk of his talents, of the blasted promise of a better Hfe, of their pity and regret, &e. &c.





Then when I have heard all I can hear without betraying myself, when my eyes grow dim and my voice fails, I hasten to my room and pour out my heart in sorrow and love, in luxurious anguish and agonies of prayer. Yes, he is depraved, and to love depravity, is to love too well. Why is vice suffered to look so lovely? why is there no mask on its brow, that all may fear and shun it? I must not think of his ivory brow, yet how often has it been flushed with riot, or pale with thought, no breast near to

receive the th robbings, and

She will never love as I have loved him. I am weak and humble with suffering, she is high and haughty with adulation; she thinks of the triumph of her beauty, I think only of him—come-to me, come to me then shadowy and silent as you come in dreams to me, that I may feel no guilt, and think it all a vision—come to me, my love, weary and fevered with the strife of life; and if a broken heart can make music, we will have songs, and if there be rest in death, we will

slumber together.

Martha, my mind is hurt I fear—I went to the window to cool my burning forehead; he was walking below; it was evening, and the street was lonely; his step was slow and irregular—what was he thinking of? possibly of some new device of extravagance, or some means of supplying it—it is impossible; no, if





I could coin my blood into drachmas fof him, it would be in vain. A mistress, two or three mistresses I believe, perpetual engagements, and perpetual losses on the turf and the hazard table; an establishment equal to that of a young nobleman, but frequented by no noblemen, by none but those to whom his vices are a sport or a subsistence. Yet still his depraviiv is not the vice of the heart, it is hardly the vice of map, it is the lapse of a spirit, whose plumage is rent and ruffled by the rude airs of earth. Ah! no, no—this is all language—dare I say it, I would say it, I love him better for his dejection and his excesses. Whatever makes him human, makes him » dear. The contrast between his weakness, his wildness, his dissoluteness, and his youth, and his form, and his softness when he speaks to women; the contrast between the blaze of his riot, and the gloom of his dejection; yet still pre





serving- his sensibility amid dissipation, and his gentleness in sorrow—it is too much for me.

This cannot continue long; his health has yielded at last to his excesses, or his sensibility. He is ill, and confined to the care of Deloraine; never did the worm riot on so rich a rose. There is much interest felt for him, and inquiry made even by strangers for him. I have more certain information, I could hardly have borne this term but for it. The wife of his valet is among our servants,- she talks of him constantly, and I listen to her, pale and silent.

Her husband, who adores his master, attends him day and night. He is sometimes delirious; when he is calm, he bids them conceal his indisposition from his uncle, whose name he often repeats with some epithet of affection. Yesterday he started from his sleep, to desire that his old pensioners should not suffer from hi* illness.





It was the first time he had ever mentioned them; weak as he was, he gave his servant the most minute directions for finding and relieving them. His vices were better known than his virtues. ... Last night his servant thought he slept uneasily; he approached him, he was grasping something that was hung about his neck by a black ribbon, and apparently struggling to hold it. In a moment after, he started, and asked his servant whether he had seen the object he held in his hand. The man said, "he had not." He then spoke particularly to himself for a few moments, then turned to his servant, and said, ff Edward, if I should die, this ribbon"

The- man burst into tears, and hurried away.

And I do not weep, I have not shed a. tear since his illness, I cannot. There is a despair of thought; and if he should die, there is a relief in despair, such as those who have loved to death like me can only know, because they dare.





Something dreadful has happened; I can make no comment on it, you cannot expect it from me. The wife of his servant has been weeping beside me all night; all night I have kept her beside me to—Weep, for she can hardly speak. Oh! Martha, this is a moment when I would not see for worlds yo'u or any one that knows, that thinks of me. I am wild, you would not know me. Constraint, and passion, and grief, and fear, are too much for me; there is no woman's heart, no human heart can bear the assaults I have borne so long. He is gene, gone in the agony of feeling; and I cannot cast myself in his way, and I cannot die under his steps, no, for that would be happiness.'

His servant, the faithful servant, had left him for a few moments. During this time he observed some confusion in





the hotel where his master lodges; he was accustomed, I believe, to the clamour of creditors; but wearied and distressed, he did not perceive that Mr. Deloraine's servant had got admittance into his room with a packet of letters from the country. He soon heard the consequences. A . burst of rage, and grief, and execration, brought him to his master's room. He had sprung from bed. He was dressing himself without assistance. The man approached, and attempted to inquire. He would listen to nothing; he would utter nothing"My uncle, Oh! my poor uncle," burst from him involuntarily every moment.

He rung the bell with violence, the. waiters rushed into the room, he ordered his curricle, a carriage, his horses, any thing, every thing, a wind to waft him to the west; it was night, the weather was dreary.

He staggered from debility while he spoke. His servant, in the impulse of the moment, threw himself at his feet lie adjured him to pause, to reflect, if he was indeed wild enough to dream of travelling at that hour,, and in that state. He promised himself, with the ardent fidelity of art Irishman, to travel on foot to the Chieftain's castle in the west, to procure him case or health, if either required it. He reminded him of his long services, and implored to he his friend. Breaking from him, he fiercely cursed all friends for traitors, and all servants for plunderers. No force could hold him. The attendants retreated from his fury.





As he rushed from the room, he staggend from feebleness. His servant, who had still followed him, scarce saved him from falling; (he, was but just raised from the bed of fever and delirium.) He turned his darkened and swimming eyes on the faithful man. "If





I should die in the journey/' said he, TM beg of my uncle not to curse my memory, and to forgive Deloraine." And he could meet that dying look, and he could listen to those sounds of softness and agony, and not ran wild as I do now. Oh! that I could run barefoot beside his wheels, till I could run no longer; to die, near him, with him, for him. He must perish, rushing upon a journey such weather, in such a state, and no arm to fold, no breast to pillow him. The earth and the elements will not feel like me —if they dhl—would I could be the dust beneath his feet, "this is net the despair of woman;" do not say go, 1 one that has roved as I have done, must despair as I do/ He . is gone, no oneknows why, or whither * * * * * * * * *******

Of these letters there was no continuation for some months. They speak of times and circumstance?





of which I could not speak in the first person. I must now assume it, to make the narrative distinct. On my arrival in the country, the journey undertaken, in . the rage of a fever, and among the snows of winter, had its natural effect.

I was suspended between life and death for months;: and the lingerings of a nervous fever pursued me through the summer. After "suffering many things of many physicians," I had yet resolution enough to tear me from the spot/ which fed my disease. I returned to Dublin, hid myself in a cottage on the sea-shore, breathed its keen air, and plunged into its waves every day; arid struggled as manfully for life, as if life for me had any worth. A few letters, which I wrote to Deloraine about this time, will describe my situation more particularly. They are merely the letters of a boy of eighteen, the victim of involuntary vice, and too voluntary sen





srbility. They are the language of a broken constitution and a world-weary spirit, mixed with remorse and concealed love.

T® J. E. Deloraine, Esq.

Black Rork, October 3.'

I Thank you—I believe I am somewhat better, at least, I am in the habit of saying so, to those who inquire about me, without caring how their inquiries are answered; and you may say so to any one who asks for me with the same feeling, or absence of feeling; but between: ourselves, I believe, dear J. I am very near being what I wish to be. Dp not be angry with me for dismissing Dr". P. I neither suspect his capacity nor attention; I would not even breathe a trivial professional jest about him; this is no time for me to speak lightly of any man's character; I acquit him and his brethren. I firmly believe all has beent done for me that they could do; but the complaint of their impotency in certain cases, is as old as the time of Macbeth, or as much older as.the operation of the passions of man on his frame. I believe I have read one exception to this general imbecility of art; did not a physician discover the passion of Antiochus for Stratonice? Were such a man now in the world, I would fly to its extremities from him. I attend to Dr. P.'s directions, and plunge into the sea every





morning with as much tenacity, as if

But I am afraid if I neglected it, they would say I neglected my health. Thisplace is quite deserted, and I am, thank Heaven, quite alone in it.

It has a strange sound, but if any thing can be of service, it will be this deep loneliness, this remission of all importunity and noise, these walks, by the tough dashing of the waters, under a grey, autumnal sky. I could not Walk in broad day-light, I would not walk where there were numbers, especially numbers of such as frequent a watering place. At present I walk almost incessantly; I cannot bear riding, one cannot stoop,- or pause, or loiter; and one is confined to the high road, and aH its host; Sjal there is a kind of jolting thoughtlessness about it, I cannot, away





with. 1 love the windings of the

shore, with the grey clouds sweeping over the cliffs, and the waves beating at my feet. I love even the shriek of the sea-gull, and the dipping of the oars at a distance; one cannot go ten steps without meeting one of the little fishingboats, doubling the crags and jut tings of the rocks; but I pass them hastily, and they hardly see me. When the tide is ©ut, I wander along the strand; any one that saw me would believe me to be a fossiKst, or marine botanist, if they observed with what intentness I unfold the clusters of sea-weed, and pick up the shells I meet. They are all for-my landlord's children—children, I am not impatient of, except those whom I see peeping at me from the cliffs, while I walk on the strands below. I cannot wonder at them, my figure must be sin* gular to them; my incessant waterings, my solitariness, the strange contrast of early youth and melancholy, deep and substantial melancholy, I cannot wonder at them. But lest they should wonder too much at me, I often walk miles into the country, to Bray, &c. I have even walked into the county Wicklow.





There are rocks and solitudes without interruption. The people with whom I live, tell me, I must be very courageous

venture into places so wild, and disturbed so lately; and I smile with the feelings of a man who is praised for a virtue the furthest from his thoughts or practice. I am sometimes dreadfully tired; but still it prevents me from thinking always, and it procures me that deep sleep which medicine has not been able to procure for me since my fever. I thank you for your recollection about my books. There arc few books I can read now; bnt send me a Werter, and send me my Elzevir Virgil, I want to read over the fourth book, and some part of the sixth; that fourth book is a wonderful production, the ancients knew so little of what we call passion. Apropos, don't you think an History of Suicides would be a striking thing? I am told there is some such thing compiling now; but it is by a barrister. I will never read it; written by him I mean. He will make it a cause in the court of Common Pleas. He will tell us of the lawfulness; or unlawfulness; the expediency, or inexpediency; the stupid, legal pour et contrc of an action, of which the human heart is bursting to1 know whether it may be forgiven.





Ever yours,

ORMSBY BETHEL.

P. S. If you write to the Castle, don't mention any of the melancholy nonsense of my letters to my poor uncle, I have cost him enough; tell him I am better, and mean to be better still. I would write to him myself, but I fear he would discover the weakness of my hand. Perhaps I shall be very well before we meet again.

To J. E Ddoraine.

Black Rock, October 6. * *, * * * *

No, no, my dear D. no more letters intended to raise my spirits; I do not enjoys I cannot read them, I cannot be broke in upon by laughter; it. is to me "very tragical mirth truly." Write tame plainly, earnestly, soothingly, as we write to those whom we believe to be not far from death.





I did not intend to say so much; but I believe I have said no more than the truth. Do not menace me with a visit from Sandys, Morris, Hoare, and the rest, I could not bear them, or they probably me; I have had too much of Sandys, Morris, Hoare, and the rest. You* and they have almost destroyed me. The first word of that sentence escaped me; you know I never reproached you, I never will reproach you. But my dear D. your cruel indulgence, your thoughtless and importunate pursuit of my gratification, or of what you imagined would gratify me, has been in its effects to me, as the most bitter enmity. Your solicitude overcame your very sense, your knowledge of my character. You knew me at least inoffensive and uneontamir





nated, with some sensibility, with more diffidence, with melancholy more than either; a blushing boy, who retreated and blushed alike at the superiority of man, and the softness of woman. You knew me averse from dissipation, and loathing depravity. Yet you, Oh, Deloraine! I looked up to you as an elder brother, I leaned on you with full and perfect confidence, I looked in your face almost for momentary direction. Why would you lead one, who trusted yon so helplessly, into vice? yes, into vice; whatever you and Hoare may call it, solitude has whispered its right name to me. You made me game without skill, you made me drink without head or taste for wine, you drove me ( yes, drove me by ridicule, the most powerful of all conductors,) to vices, from which habitual diffidence and boyish youth rendered me even more abhorent, and for which intoxication was even a necessary preparative—when you laughed at the sickliness of male modesty; oh! that you had known the sickness and the fear I stifled to join the laugh; you kept noisy crowds about me for ever, you hurried me from tavern to tavern, you kept me in a state of artificial madness: oh! that you had left me to myself: I implored, I besought you to do so, I told you I was too young for those things, I begged you to have mercy on my youth; I entreated for a book and the society of the few worthy men who yet condescend to notice me^. You know I told you I was but sixteen the first place you dragged me to. While I write this, I feel my forehead and cheeks, pale as they have long been, covered with burning spots. I could not write thus, were a creature in the room with me.





And now that I have written, I reproach myself for it; it was your kindness for me I know; you discovered, that is, thought you had discovered, thaiI was unhappy, and drove me into dissipation to forget it. If I was unhappy, it was an unhappiness which dissipation, could not remove, you could neither know its cause nor. its remedy. But my dear D. should my health be irreparably injured, should your fatal kindness plunge me into an early grave,; remember it, I implore you for your ownnse and monition, and never lead one who trusts you as I did with the openness of youth and affection, into the courses you have led me. The timemakes plain language a kind of duty tome.





Should you ever meet with one likeme, ignorant, and willing to continue so, do not force him to learn what I have learned so reluctantly, perhaps so fatally -r do. not feel that my sensations. are less painful, because my errors were (you know) involuntary: perhaps they are





more so. I have a jealousy, a restlessness, a shame of myself; 'which is always the symptom of early, unhabitual vice. Yet still I have a recurrence of thoughts such as I ought to banish, at least ou^ht not to suffer to please me as they do: and which, when I resist them, return in ray dreams. Oh! I have such dreams —is there guilt in dreams? Dear D. write me no more such letters. I don't want to know about the low curricles and the Hessian boots. I will have neither, I will not run in debt; whether my thoughts will betray me or not, I have a power over my actions.

I do not wish to part with my horses, because my groom is A well-principled lad, and supports his widowed mother

on his wages. If J s insists on being

paid before I receive my next remittance, dispose of my watch for what you can get for it, and satisfy him. I have no wish to distress him* and I cannot bear a tradesman's clamours.





But I will strip myself to my last shilling, I will go without a meal and without a coat, I will deal with Jews, with the devil, before I will apply to my poor uncle for a shilling beyond my allowance. Don't mention it again D. don't hint at it, do'nt think of it. I have been compelled to give him a blow already which he will never recover, or I either; I will at least never repeat it: my only consolation is, I was compelled, my extravagance was involuntary; I never will be stabbed again by his anger and his forgiveness. D. you know me to possess some resolution, should my uncle through your, or any other means, hear of or suffer from my lapses again, I will plunge myself into the sea that is heaving in my sight this moment.

O. BETHEL.





P. S. Don't shew my letters to any one, I cannot bear to be laughed at, you know I cannot; let them think me a gay fellow still, I am satisfied that no one should know me—but you.

Black Rock, October 8. ******* *

Mr plan has succeeded; the family has removed to the Rock, where they will stay as long as he will, his motions are so irregular. In such wretched plans my life is wasted; yet to see him is not so much, to see him as he is now, pale, dejected, unhappy, is perhaps the most useful lesson of pain and penitence any object can teach me now; at all events I have the indulgence, and I may have the improvement—indulgence—who but myself could bear the indulgence of his sight? When I see his pale cheek as he

passes unconsciously near me, when I see him stretched for hours on the* rocks almost beneath my window, when I see him break from the gaze which his fine and wasted form draws from the passenger, when I see him as I do to-night, by the strong lights that turn in his room, traversing it slowly, and sometimes leaning against the window, and seeming to listen to the toll of the bell, that tolls for a funeral by night; when I see this, and feel him sigh as he listens; when I see this, and feel the bitterness of love and death, and my forehead throbs, and a gush of agony rises in my throat, and tears, in which I am wasting away, mingle as they flow, with the broken voice of sorrow and love—is this indulgence—it is—

We meet like spirits, my love is hardly mortal. The flush of early feeling, the hope, which all wild and impossible as it is. we yet cannot separate from love, the rich, warm, summer-tint that passion sheds on life—are all gone. The change from these to the objects that now surround me; to the darkness of autumn, the cold and solitary shores, and the pale form that wanders along them, is not greater than the change in my mind and senses; I hardly see him with the eyes of sense: will ail the fine pageantry fade thus from my mind! will the light that has played on my path be darkened before that is finished! I would I could lie





down and die in its setting sweetness. ********

I will not tell you the strange device I have employed for—what I can hardly tell, whether it will produce pleasure or pain to me.

To J. L. Deloraine, Esq.

October 11. ********

I Can conceal nothing from you, it has been the habit of my mind to pour out all it knows or feels with childish profusion on you; if I have met no acquaintance, I have met un avanture. I found the other day in a recess among' the rocks, (where I often go, when the tide is out, for shells) a letter tied with a hunch of sea-weed, as if some nereid had floated on a wave with it there; it was addressed to me, I opened it, and have every day since found one in the same place. The style of them is as singular as the circumstances; they are written in a female hand, and are evidently the production of a female mind, and that mind strongly tinged with romance and the Romish religion.





They are full of -a .-pu re and mystic morality, ifaey present the picture of'a melancholy and: impassioned mind,1 feeding itself with the«visions of religion, of ailife and feelings chequered with gleams of devotion, which pours over it a light, soniferous, and J fitful and -fantastic, 'as the colours which fall'from the " storied window" of a cloister, on the ghostly cheek of - its inmate, who gazes on it in the moonlight. These letters contain manymonitions (which seem to imply a knowledge of the events of my life) and exhortations and promises, but the very promises are tinged . with melancholy, and there is a pining and compulsory tone where they speak of the worthlessness of this world and its enjoyments, which seems the tone of a mind not convinced by its own reasoning, and more willing to condemn than to relinquish them.





All this is extraordinary, but what is still more so, my invisible correspondent has insisted on a relation of my life, and I have complied. I deposit my papers every day in the same place where I find the letters, aad they are re-placed tbe following day. It would be impossible to copy them in the interval, and if it were possible, there could be no danger, no one can make a bad use of the confessions of a penitent of eighteen.

P. S. Not a line from Hammond or my sister.

*****.*

The narrative which I wrote for my nameless correspondent I here insert for you. It contains an account of the early parts of my life, such as every one loves to recall: it is marked by one peculiarity.





The secret which it was the business of my life- to watch, and in the concealment of which life had been almost destroyed, is told here without reserve.

It is hardly possible to explain the feeling that prompted me to this disclosure. But the wildness of solitude and rojmantic dejection,the mysteriousness of my correspondent, and the high and peculiar tone of the letters I rece ved, altogether left an impression on my mind, as if I had to do wit some superior bei g, whom to deceive was impossible, and with whom duplicity would be as much a folly > as a crime: the narrative contains more of opinions than events, I know not whether that will be a defect Or a recommendatipn; to you.

I have none of the common motives of biographers for writing my own life. I have neither ambition of praise, nor desire of vindication, I have no wish to revile or panegyrise, to accuse or to defend. For me life has no further employment, or hope, or charm.





1 was born at Ailly au Clochers in France, about the beginning of the year 17— ;.it would be difficult to discover in what month, for in an ebullition of revolutionary philanthrophy, in September 92, they burnt the prior of the benedictine convent there, an old, helpless, harmless priest, and lit the pyre with the registers of his church, in which my name I have heard was inserted. In ray "childhood I' was hurried about from place- to place, I knew not by whom, for what purpose: I was never taught to call any one parent or relative, but if not, no early feeling was excited in me» but that of distinction. Le petit Milor Anglois, le bel Enfant, and other names of praise and deference, taught me even in infancy to recognize that passion, which has been the distinction and the scourge of my existence, taught me to





look on myself as a being marked by

superiority from the beginning, very

early, so early that I forgot my informer.

I heard that my parents were Irish. At

about seven years old, I remember being

struck by the difference between the glad

and sunny skies of Languedoc, and the

dark, heavy air I then began to breathe

in London, and still more strongly by the

obsequiousness and pliancy of my late

attendants, contrasted with the rough

looks and language of the English. ******

I remember being placed with a person and bis wife, who occupied a small house in Tottenham-Court-road, and whose modes of life were so still and monotonous, that they sobered and fixed my childish attention; objects recurring so unfailingly made an impression on my mind, which they could never have owed to their importance. I exercised a degree of observation on the habits of this man and his wife, such as now appears marvellous to me, what I recollect of them I shall yet relate, for the mind pleases itself with its early acquisitions. They had been in business, and for many years were content . with the silent accumulation of moderate profits; at length they fancied themselves weary of the drudgery of trade, they called in their debts, examined their capital, reminded each other that they liad no children, and no expectation of them, and that it was foolish, with the means of ease, to exhaust life in unnecessary toil. When they had made this discovery, their joy was great; they wondered what demon had prevented them from, making it before; and that they might lose no time in taking advantage of it, sunk their property for an annuity, and took a small house in TottenhauiCourt-road. In a few weeks the bustle of removal was over, there was nothing more to propose or to do. They sat down





in their easy chairs, looked in each others faces for happiness, and met only discontent and weariness: shame, however, prevented their communicating a mutual wish that they were back again in Botolph-lane, and from those who. visited them in curiosity or in idleness, they extorted perpetual praises of a stagnant pool in the middle of their garden, in the weeds of which they had entangled an artificial duck, and of the rural murmurs of an hogfeeder's styes next door, by whom (in the triumph of her heart) Mrs. Simpson assured her visitors her mornings' rest had been broken ever since her removal to the country.

They had resided twelve years in this place, when I became their inmate, and with every year had their dis content, disappointment, and weariness increased.

By that time all struggles had ceased; they had subsided inio torpid dejection.

EO





I can recollect no one day that differed from another. They rose late with wonder at each other's sluggishness, and a resolution to commence an habit of early rising the following Monday.

The morning was passed by Mr. Simpson in examining books of obsolete accounts, which he had brought with him from the city "against a rainy day/' as he said in totting up sums, whose numbers he could by that time tell blindfold, and when he had found the amount, yawning and beginning again; sometimes he strolled about the house, examined locks that did not want repairing, shook his head at the weather glass, and projected a removal of the clock from behind the parlour door, where its ticking made him melancholy after dinner. His wife retired to her room, examined the contents of old drawers, discovered that things grew yellow by lying by, and resolved to 4





expose them to the sun some day in the following week; at a certain hour she visited the kitchen, watched the intrusion of strange cats, and detected the turnspit in his many contrivances to escape from duty, hy which she boasted, dinner was prevented from being five minutes later than the time. They dined early without appetite, and retired early without drowsiness, sometimes a walk was proposed, on the appearance of a fine morning, but then the weather-glass was examined, till the time for walking had passed away; and looking wistfully at each other, they sunk into their easy chairs, and counted how many minutes till dinner. Sunday indeed presented some variation of habits; they had much of that attentiveness and decency in matters of religion which the middling orders of the English are distinguished by; solitude had driven them to meditation, and of a long evening they / sometimes looked into the Bible in lelfdefence; not however without some compunction for the unfitness of the study an any evening but that of the Sabbath. That day of employment threw a beam of cheerfulness even on Saturday; it reminded them to compare the distance of the nearest' churches, to lay plans for possessing themselves of the seats adjacent to the reading desk, and not suffer, by a foolish forbearance, the church-warden's wife to deprive them of the largest cushions. The day itself saw them punctually attend service thrice, and laboriously fill up the intervals with what they believed to be appropriate reading. They never read the scriptures, habitually I mean, the lessons of revelation could hardly have been reconciled with a life of squalid indolence, and hopeless depression; but every religious work, whose tone was not lofty or peculiar, perused in the intervals of public service with a rueful, tenacity, "a sad civility,





that yielded neither to difficulty nor weariness."

Sermons, treatises, exhortations, were all alike devoured; as they proceeded their faculties grew more cloudy from perplexity, and their tempers more sour from restraint; yet still they read on, without any discrimination between the spirit and the forms of religion, to believe that what they did was right, though ready to gnaw their own flesh with wearinsss and vexation. Such was their superstitious adherence to hours, that I have seen them checked in the midst of a bitter contention, which the characteristic peevishness of the day had excited, by recollecting it was time to read prayers, and renewing it again the moment the volume of peace was closed. I have heard Mr. Simpson complain bitterly of a preacher, whose sermon had dismissed him (from his slumber) a few minUtes earlier than usual, which he observed, "was a very





unfair thing of a Sunday, when a man has nothing at home, but—his wife. They were seldom disturbed by visitors: some city cousins had called of them during the first months of their retirement; but their curiosity was soon satisfied, and they had no other motive for their visits, for it was known that the Simpsons had sunk their property for an annuity. Besides, Mr. and Mrs. S. had discovered (what - elderly retired people are very apt to discover) that it was to preserve the neatness of an house open to the intrusion of strangers, and that of the three visitors who had disturbed them during the last month, one had neglected to dean his feet on the scraper, another had placed the hearth-brush on the wrong side of the fire-place, and a third had stirred the fire, though the price of coals had been hinted in his hearing, and his remark on the coldness of the weather had been, contradicted. In the misery in which I found them (the misery of ease unpurchased by labor, and indulgence unpreceded by restraint, of solitude without any of the resources which solitude requires, and of mental disquietude which could not be charged on external objects) they had not submitted without struggles of resistance, without much wonder' at their own waywardness, and repeated accusations of the state of the weather. At length in despair they advertised for a lodger, and endeavoured to persuade each other they would find a pleasure in society yet untried. "At all events," said Mr. S. "we shall not lose by it." The persons to whom I was committed, understood that they were sober and creditable, and accordingly I was placed with them as the son of a gentleman abroad; masters attended me at their house, and as my allowance was ample, I was treated with as much distinction as narrow minds could bestow. But solitude was no scene for me. In a few months the lassitude I witnessed, invaded me, I lost my appetite and my complexion; I began to loath myself, and every thing around me, nothing could inspirit me to diligence, or invite me to play. The images of sleepy depression I beheld, benumbed me; it is indeed impossible to imagine a life of more weariness, debility, and degradation. Yet this is adopted by thousands, and at some part of life, its outline is sketched by almost all, as the repose of labour, and the indulgence of age. Its effect on me has been to make me abhor the idea of tranquillity, to shrink from retirement, as from ignominy and misery, and to regard such objects and proposals with a mind of instinctive and incurable dread, which my reason is perpetually disclaiming. When they found my health was injured by the solitary dejection of home, they sent me to school. ***** *********





. There is nothing I dislike more than an abstract delineation of passion and character. Man is not to be represented by description, but by action. I recollect but few circumstances of my own childhood, but all I recollect is characteristic. When I say characteristic, I do not mean it of the fugitive and venial propensities of childhood, but of those qualities which adhere to and compose the character of the man—such alone are worth relating. Mr, Simpson, who thought he had some degree of knowledge of religious matters, one night took it into his head to examine my proficiency in them. I was not ignorant of the elementary topics he spoke on: at length having warmed himself with their contemplation, he began rather to declaim than to examine. He spoke of the day of judgment. It was impossible even for him to speak on such a subject, without communicating some awe to a young mind. I listened while he described the reward of the just; I asked , eagerly, "would their reward be so public?" "Yes, in the sight of men and angels, in the sight of their enemies," the tears gushed into my eyes—of the remainder of the lecture I .have no recollection.





****** I had been some time at school, when I observed one day a little tnishapen urchin assaulting with all the virulence of teeth and nails, a boy who neither made resistance, nor shewed resentment; my blood boiled, I ran up to them. "How can you suffer yourself to be mauled by that little reptile," ,f Do you not see," said the boj, c' that he is weak and a cripple."—" That is a lye," said the cripple, redoubling his blows. " Can you bear," said I "that he should give you





the lye, you are afraid of him, 'tis your cowardice that makes you so patient." The boy made no reply, but when the little wasp had wearied himself, darting his fangs, he approached me quietly." "\ou are of. my own age," said he, "and as strong as I am; I shall readily prove to -you that I am no coward."— We fought, and I got a complete beating: sore as I was with my defeat, I admiredthe boy's patience and courage, and as soon as I was able to speak, I held out my hand to him, and desired we might be friends. "No," said he, repelling my hand, "we can never agree, you are too light-minded for me, you change your opinions, and love and hate too suddenly for me, we should never agree." I remained, gnawing my lip. Some time after the dwarf whose name I have forgot, who endeavoured to make himself dreaded for mischief if not for strength, fastened on





me as a butt for his gibing knaveries". In imitation of Morton's steadiness, I bore his persecutions without wincing, though I would rather have borne the bastinado; ridicule was to me, always, worse than "s firebrands, arrows, and death." At length I discovered that the dwarf had stolen some of my books;- there was something romantic in the resolution 1 adopted.

Nothing was easier than to point out the delinquent, but when the books were enquired for, I suffered their loss to be ascribed to my negligence, and was punished without a murmur. On that day Hammond came up to me. "Why did you let your little enemy escape?"— "Because he was my enemy." Hammond looked at me incredulously, "Had I exposed him," said I "you would have believed it done in revenge."—" And was it on my account, you submitted to be punished when you did not deserve it?" I was silent, he extended his hand to me, then I seized it eagerly. People who read this may smile at the eternal friendships of boys of 10 and 12, yet our friendship has been indissoluble.





HCHAP. IL

After this, I will not" conceal my own fastidious levity. .«

A number of us strolled into the fields; it. was evening, my companions pursued different sports. I sat down upon a bank, and gazed on the setting sun, and on the colours with which his departing had filled the west, till a tear, of which I knew not the source, came to my eye. No being, from the hour of infancy, ever gazed on nature with a more enthusiastic mind than I did. Hammond came up to me, "Why don't you come and play with the rest of the lads?" I pointed to the glorious western clouds, and motioned him to sit down by me silently. "Come away," said he, pulling me roughly by the arm,





"come along, and join us, the lads will all laugh at you."—" I do not mind their laughter," said I, with a look that was designed to speak volumes of indignant sensibility. "But I do," said he, and was bounding lightly away, when;I caught him by the arm. He had shocked and disconcerted me; my whole soul was in a state of revolt and hostility to him. "Hammond," said I, "here let-our illconcerted friendship end; we: have no sympathy of minds, we have' nothing in common, here let us part."—" No, Bethel," said the manly-minded boy, "him to whom I have promised my regards, I cannot leave so'liVhtly; you embrace a friend, and renounce - hwn; I embrace him, and adhere to him for ever. I have not precisely your feelings, but there are many offices in friendship, beside sitting down with you to weep at the beams of the setting sun." Such was Hammond; if from these sketches,





the ardour, the ambition, the sanguine levity of my character cannot be sufficiently collected, there will be a stronger exemplification in the events of my life.

Amid the rough encounters of a school, the peculiarities of my character might perhaps have been worn away, had not the state of my health at this juncture made a removal from London necessary.

The cause was singular: no being could live in more contented ignorance of their parentage and connexions than I had done for thirteen years; I know not to what to ascribe it, perhaps to my being too much wrapt in the operations of my own mind. I was one day standing at Mr. S.'s window, his servant was in the room, whom I had never observed as remarkably communicative; an equipage suddenly passed the door, "There is your father," said the servant vacantly. . I started—my father—every nerve in my body quivered; I neither ate nor spoke for the remainder of the day. In the night I recollect something of an obscure struggle, and even in sleep a kind of feverish and blind resistance to some force I could not distinguish; I was at length awakened, and discerned several persons about my bed, wiih fear in their faces. I learned from their conversation, that I had been found in my sleep attempting to make my escape in the direction of the road through which my father had been pointed to me as' passing in the morning. From that period my health gradually declined; and the persons who (by what order I knew not,) occasionally visited me, became so alarmed at my haggard and listless aspect, that they removed me from Mr. S.'s; and believing that a change of air was all the relief I required, sent me to the wilds of Cumberland.





The change did indeed relieve me, but it was by operating on sources of my

VOL. I. F





complaint utterly beyond their comprehension: when I stood no longer at the window where I seemed for ever to hear the sounds, "there is your father," and from which, while it was day-light, there was no forcing me; while I no longer fixed my straining eyes on the spot where his carriage had disappeared for ever; when in sleep I no longer seemed to hang upon its wheels, and call upon him till the sound died in my lips; when all this ceased, with change of place, my health recovered gradually. I lived with a clergyman, who was both my host and tutor. His house, or rather cottage, stood amid the most wild and aerial scenery of the lakes. I have no intention of making the reader scan the heights of Helvellyn, or follew the windings of Dovedale. But the effect of this scenery on my character was powerful, and almost creative.

All the wandering rays of feeling or imagination I possessed, were concentred and conducted by the glorious objects with which I became familiar. My heart wasted its energies on rock and wood, and water. When I first arrived there, I loved to hear children talk of their parents; and I often gazed earnestly in the faces of those who I thought might satisfy the yearnings of my soul, if they would; but the name of father never passed my lips.





When his idea came to mv mind, I would rush out with the swiftness of a stag, and try, by climbing and running, to lose mvself in the violence of motion.

J

By this means my health grew robust imperceptibly; and to pass my days and evenings amid mountain-breezes, and the healthful strife of exercise was changed from an impulse into an habit.

What dreams were mine for three years! In my wanderings, my mind did not waste itself in marking the shapes of clouds, or counting the circles made by a pebble in the water; it was stored with precious aud pregnant imagery. My tutor was at least an excellent scholar; I read with him more of the ancients than boys often read in schools or colleges. He was too indolent to make my education a task; and we read with intervals and interruptions that facilitated the progress of a mind irregular and, restless like mine. In his study, if it deserved the name, were some books which he had brought with him from Oxford, and never opened since; they were odd volumes of Dryden, Lee, and the dramatists of Charles the Second's time, Milton, Shakespeare, The Arabian Nights Entertainments, Hcywood's Hierarchy of the Blessed Angels, Grose's popular Superstitions, Glanyille's History of Witchcraft, Magia Adamica, a work very old and scarce, of which the author purports to be Ray





mond Lully, and Percy's and Evan's collections of old English ballads. What a library for a boy of fifteen, who traversed the solitude of lakes and mountains in the day, and paused to read them amid the evening murmur of winds, and dashing of waterfalls! I became an incurable visionary. The ancient authors I read, instead of correcting, confirmed this habitude. It is a very different thing to read an author at the narrow desk, and in the gross-heated atmosphere of a school; and amid objects which form a comment on the text of the poet, where the mountain air is waving among the pages, and the light that falls on them is chequered by the leaves of a gigantic oak. During three years, my life was a species of romantic intoxication.

The reading of Ossian completed my infatuation. But there was one exercise of mind to which I was so strongly inclined, that at length all my meditations tended to, and were lost in it. Amid the spots of quiet clouds that lay scattered over the evening sky, like islands on the great deep; I have imagined some fortunate spot, some abode peopled by fair forms, human in their affections, their habits, in every thing but vice and weakness; to these I have imagined myself giving laws, and becoming their sovereign and their benefactor.





The idea was sufficiently chimerical, for in a state of innocence there was no occasion for restraint; and in the equality produced by universal excellence, there was no room for sovereign or superior. I was therefore compelled to admit some shades into the character of my imaginary community; but I resolved they should be such as held a latent affinity with virtue, or could be easily reconciled to it by legislative discipline and cultivation. I therefore imagined





them possessed of the most shining qualities that can enter into the human character, glowing with untaught affections, and luxuriant with uncultivated virtue; but proud, irritable, impetuous, indolent, and superstitious; conscious of claims they knew not how to support. burning with excellencies, which, because they wanted regulation, wanted both dignity and utility; and disgraced by crimes which the moment after their commission they lamented, as a man laments the involuntary outrages of drunkenness. I imagined a people that seemed to stretch out its helpless hands, like the infant Moses from the ark, and promise its preserver to bless and dignify the species.

When I had conceived this character, such was its consistency, its vraisemblance, that I immediately concluded it to be real. I was satisfied there existed such a people—with the hesitation of one who fears his purpose is suspected, I mentioned the character I had conceived to my tutor, and asked if he thought it possible that any people were distinguished by such features. He answered immediately, that I had accurately described the Irish nation.





From that moment a firm and habitual purpose took possession of my soul. It was my morning's meditation, it was the vision oF my night. To be the reformer and legislator of a country I had never seen, nor with one native of which I was acquainted, may perhaps excite a smile of the most piteous contempt; yet, from the effects of this suggestion on my own mind, I am convinced, it is to such musings that we are to trace the source of those lonely, remote events, which have agitated the World, and changed the most settled aspect of things.





CHAP III.

It was in the spring of the year that my tutor was somewhat surprized at receiving the following letter.

London, April 10.

DEAR SIR,

"I should have written before to (hank you for the pains you have bestowed on my son's health and education;

but these cursed easterly winds -in

short, every circumstance in this infernal country compels me to execrate my own existence. At this moment, the venders of the vilest commodities are vociferating below my window, my very window. In Paris, (while it was Paris) the hotels were enclosed in spacious areas, and the intrusions of the canaille effectually prevented. , But to return to my son, I am sensible I have not paid him all the attention I ought. Possibly it was fortunate for him, as it was the means of placing him, sir, under your tuition. From such a mode of education, I should indeed have recoiled in my earlier days. But what signifies educating men for polished enjoyments now? there is no polish, no enjoyment; the world has lost all capacity of giving pleasure, or perhaps I have lost all capacity for admitting it. So much the better, the fine champaign of life is all drawn off, and only the vapid lees are left. I remember the time; but women are no longer women, wine is no longer wine, I believe I am no longer myself. I remember the time when. yet, curse me, if I have so much pleasure in remembering those times cither. But I have no business to teaze you with my





morbid petulance. I understand, my very good sir, your pupil has grown tall and awkward, and headstrong; you see I give him credit for all the accomplishments a youth educated in England can be supposed to possess. I have felt the disadvantage of not residing in the country where my" property lies. I mean, therefore, that Ormsby shall graduate in the University of Dublin, and reside finally in Ireland. The disadvantage of his birth will be overlooked there, or considered rather as a compliment to the country. I intend that his education shall be rigidly regular. By Heaven, I will empty the whole magazine of discipline on him. Since there are no comforts in vice, I will prove that there are some rigours in virtue too. He shall not have the advantage of me both in pleasure and in praise. I understand my agent has settled with you annually for his board, &c. Be pleased to accept of the enclosed as a mark of iny gratitude for your attention to your pupil.





I remain, &c. &c. &c.

LIONEL M. BETHEL."

My tutor was much disturbed at the necessity of answering his correspondent, whom I now understood to be a man of large fortune, and splendid connexions. Whether he suspected me of a degree of refinement, he did not possess himself, I cannot tell; but he requested me to revise his answer, which was as follows.

SIR,

"I received yours of the 10th instant, which came safe to hand; but for a small accident if met by falling into my shaving-pot, which however did not signify a rush, your hand being tolerably legible, considering how much you have lived in outlandish parts. As to the easterly winds, they have been very rife in f.'





our parts; but how they could obstruct your letter, I cannot conceive, unless it was to come partly by water. You speak also of certain venders and vile commodities under your window. I am astonished how the police of London can suffer such things; my maid removes them here every morning.

"As to your champaign all being drawn off, I am sorry for it; but cannot say I ever took much to foreign wines, never having tasted any but once at a fellow-commoner's treat, when being overtaken in liquor, I was found in the quadrangle, and reprimanded by the dean. As to your son, he is a very good young man; but a little flighty or so, which perhaps runs in the family, whereby he is not to blame. I saw some lines in a poem at a friend's, which exactly describe his character. (I have not the poem myself, because it was written by a Scotsman;) the lines run thus:





*' In sooth, be was a strange and wayward wight, "Fond of each gentle and each dreadful scene."

And the like, which I have forgot.

'* In truth, it grieves my heart to part with the boy; but I thank you, sir, for the draft. In truth, I would give as much money again to keep him with me. The country to which you are sending him is a very wild place. I pray Heaven they may not turn him Papist or wild Irishman among them. I should have sent you his last exercise; but supposing you do not understand Latin,

Remain your's, &c.

J. ADAMS."

The letter quenched at least half my desire to see my father. The allusion, so abruptly made, to my illegitimacy, shocked and incensed me against one who could insult the misfortune he had occasioned. Yet with all my resentment, a secret sentiment of pleasure mingled itself with the discovery. There is perhaps in. every mind an habit of considering persons in my circumstances as peculiarly marked out for the great and extraordinary events of life. This conclusion with whatever justice, I drew at once in my own case; it accorded with the habitual object of my mind, and it reconciled me to imaginary degradation.





I quitted England without seeing my father, and arrived in another country with no more knowledge of my destination, than that which I carried within my own breast. I was placed in the house of a strict Dissenter, and entered the University of Dublin. Perhaps it is expected that I should here speak a few words of that institution. Too much ridicule has been heaped upon it. It has been upbraided with a stupidity, an indolence, a lameness of proficiency, which have been in a great measure the result

4





of circumstances unavoidable, and now unalterable, in the frame of the institution. In the first place, the fellows, instead of being the lean, secluded students of a cloister, whom it would be as difficult to solicit from its walls, as to make the effigy of its founder descend from his monument, are the inmates of a populous and dissipated city, husbands, fathers of families, men on fire in the pursuit of various distinctions, as churchmen, as preachers, as agreeable and convivial men, formed to embellish mixed society, and allured to it by every tie that has power over the most worldly and tumultuous faculties of the mind. By their obligations as tutors, they are compelled to devote the most numerous hours of the early and vigorous part of life to the tuition of youth. On the number of these their profits principally depend; and a number of these they therefore endeavour to secure, by adopting the





maimers, and frequenting the assemblies of the world. When this period is passed, their capacity for business has passed away along with it; they are elderly men, saturated with the irksome routine of collegiate duties, and anxious, by accepting some college living, to escape from tumultuous to pacific indolence. Are these men who can be expected to illuminate the world with those laborious lucubrations, which can only be produced by the union of unbroken solitude, unambitious competence, congenial stillness, and habitual application? Another defect in the constitution of the Dublin University I shall notice, without inquiring whether it is original or voluntary : I mean the total neglect of the most valuable part of literature, modern and native literature, the study of the English language, its writers, its powers, and its productions, the extent of its resources, the laws of its composition, and





the graces of its delivery. Instead of this, the quarterly examinations (a noble exercise of the youthful mind and passions, if rightly applied,) are exhausted in a strife of scholastic quaintness, and hereditary subtleties, which, without enlarging the mind, or unfolding the principles of science, excites a temporary tension, a petulant precocity, an ambitious and straining spirit of conjecture in the mind, more worthy of a Jesuitical seminary, or an examination in the metaphysical grammary of Thomas Aquinas.

The consequence is, that men educated in the College of Dublin, without an immediate view to collegiate distinctions, are in general eminently destitute of collegiate improvement; the flimsy furniture requisite for this temporary struggle is soon thrown aside; and when thrown aside, forgotten for ever: while the substantial panoply that qualifies for a literary encounter, that cleaves to us even when the period for its use is over— the net of the retiarius, can only be employed in the combat; but the arms of the soldier give a "form and pressure/' and military mould, to the limbs, which dignifies the veteran even in the hour of repose.





The students in the University of Dublin are not educated with any consideration for the peculiar faculties of distinct minds; all are alike compelled to- read the same portion of the classics and the sciences; there are few encouragements to voluntary application, few outlets for the natural propensities of the genius: yet it is perhaps to such accidental remissions of the rigour of uniformity, such allowed digressions from the path of discipline, that we owe its most felicitous and luxuriant expansions. This, however, may be considered as the necessary evil of every academic institutioa; but there is another of much greater magnitude and mischief. I mean the total absence of a final view and reference to the uses of life, and the ornament of profession, iu the collegiate education. The superiors of it seem to undergo the same defect in mental vision, that the vulgar do in actual, when they refer the stars of heaven to the concave in which they appear to be placed, without considering them as belonging to a peculiar sphere, and pouring light on space as yet unmeasured and unseen. The use of the principles of logic in every part of life can only be disputed by those who are destitute of its advantages; but I am far from seeing the use of that puzzling and abstract examination in its subtleties, which only excites the vanity of premature and unprofitable acuteness. I shall be thought perhaps to rebel against all collegiate authority, when I decrj the other parts of science; yet might it not





be asked of what probable or general use can the Elements of Euclid, the ascent of fluids in capillary tubes, or the revolutions of the cycloid -be to the divine, the lawyer, or the physician? I am much mistaken if one student in an hundred carries home with him a taste for, or even recollection of those topics which were only cultivated as supplying the temporary triumphs of the hall. It cannot be urged that it is the duty of a learned boy to cultivate the more abtruse parts of science, as its rewards are promised to those who are distinguished by scientific attainments. The number of fellows is twenty-two, that of the students may amount to some hundreds; according to this answer therefore, the object of this single fountain of national education, is (probably) to make twenty-two"pedants, and some hundreds of dunces. If it be indeed necessary for the superiors of this institution to be possessed of- certain cabbala of science, incommunicable, and useless in general society, on which they themselves seldom write, and never converse; yet surely men, whose destination is for the world and its busiest scenes, may be exempted from an obligation to study what it is almost a duty to forget when in the world.





Would not the study of Euglish literature, including (possibly the best productions in) history, the more proximate parts of natural philosophy, civil, rhetorical, critical, and poetical researches, together with the elements of theology, and (most important of all) a summary, but comprehensive view of the evidences of revealed religion, be of more consequence to them, as men and citizens, than what Milton, in his tractate of education, calls the "Intellective Abstractions" of science, in which they only acquire acuteness without penetration, an habit of combination without comparison, a desire of discovery without investigation? I know the subjects which I consider as most important to the student are not entirely overlooked by the University of Dublin; but they are taught superficially and incidentally, rewards for them are not so frequent, nor is distinction in them (considered as) so honorable. The spirit of these studies is not kept alive by frequent subjects of composition being assigned, by large premiums, and by public competition, while diligence is eacouraged, and emulation inflamed at the quarterly examinations, by praise and profit, and celebrity, and a general spirit of exhilarated stimulation, and almost dramatic ( isplay, by every thing that can rouse the ambition of talent, and the ardour of youth. What I have said unfavourable of this institution, I have said with sincerity and regret, not as a censure of faults I have laboured to detect, but as an apology for failings which my zeal to discover excellence may perhaps have magnified. Should the time ever arrive, when education shall be conducted in subserviency to the purposes of life, and colleges shall be considered as vestibules to the great temple of active knowledge, the university shall see the curse and the reproach of her barrenness removed, and her offspring, like Hannah's, more favoured than that of her reproachful rival. Considering merely their native powers of intelligence and application, I know no men more calculated to give to learning the graces of facility, the value of use, and the dignity of virtue, than the fellows and students of the University of Dublin.





Such has been the result of my observation on this institution; my proficiency in it was moderate, for my mind was occupied by other meditations. On my first arrival in the country, I flattered myself that I was studying the national character and tracing the. germs of patriotism and courage in the face of a peasant, till I found myself gazing on a public building, or an equipage whose whirl stunned me as it passed. There is, perhaps, no discovery so mortifying as this to a Paoli or a Kosciusko of sixteen. At length I suffered myself to sink into the stream of things, sent out every sense in quest of objects of novelty, and in every interval of solitude stamped and writhed under the burden of vacancy, and compared myself to Telemachus in the Isle of Calypso.





But I was soon occupied by other objects, objects which made even my political enthusiasm disappear like a morning's dream; and earth with all its varieties disappear with it. There are in the University of Dublin, as in every other, a number of students devoted to what are called evangelical principles,

VOL. I. G





that is, with very few exceptions, to strict Calvinism. They exist in a state of secrecy which it is their delight and their employment to maintain; for narrow minds are fond of petty policy. This concealment is however necessary, for the superiors of the college are with reason judged to be averse to Calvinistic principles, whose direction commonly leads their professors to enter into the dissenting ministry. The society is kept together by frequent assemblings, prayers, and discourses, waitings ovei' the degeneracy of the Established Church, and denunciations against those who keep the key of knowledge from the world, "who are destroyed by its lack."

It is impossible, without being a member of such an institution, to imagine its effects on the minds of young men whose religion was the religion of passion, and who were but too much flattered by such a religion. The system of Calvin is





amazingly splendid and awful. A youthful mind in its first pursuit of religion, neither inquires for evidence, nor wishes conviction; it demands something that may fill to the utmost its capacity of the marvellous; something under which its faculties may succumb in mute acquies- cence; something that requires not the labour of ascent; but the passiveness of . prostration. To such demands the Calvinistic system is abundantly adequate.

I am not about to discuss the falsehood or the truth of the system, but merely to state its effects on my own imagination and feelings. When I speak of Calvinism, I speak of it not as it exists in the writings of that reformer, but in the works of the Presbyterian Writers, particularly the silenced ministers of 1 Charles the Second's time, together with the more modern ones of the American divines, Edwards, Flavel, &c.; and the still more modern, Hervey, Romaiae, *





Doddridge, &c. These men, whatever may be said of the truth or conformity to scripture in their opinions, had the power of recommending them most forcibly to the imagination.

The great evil to be dreaded in a religious system, is that debility and dejection which a mind, unnaturally divided from the world and its ordinary exercises, is but too apt to resign itself to—that burden and heat of the day, under which the most vigorous labourer has sunk, when the freshness of novelty has ceased, and the temptation of reward is still distant. This they have endeavoured to exclude, by keeping the mind in a tumult of trembling solicitude or rapturous elevation, by dividing the long path of duty into strongly-marked stages; assigning to each its peculiar hopes and fears, and struggles and triumphs, diminishing weariness by perpetual variety, abridging distance by the intervention of





new objects, alarming the secure by the fears of declension, and stimulating the urgent by shouts of promise the most sanguine and inspiring. They represent the state of the religionist, under the strongest images that the most vivid and awakening representations of the Jewish history can afford. He who is about to commence a religious course, is described as a Lot, fleeing from the devoted cities of the plain; as a murderer, whom the avenger of blood has pursued to the very gates of refuge; sometimes in the milder metaphors of the New Testament, as one who sits with listening watchfulness at the door of hope, as one who waits for the passing sound of blessed steps, and extorts by loud and restless importunity the gift of spiritual light. Those who are supposed to have attained the divine favour, are described as in a state of endless warfare: men, devils, and the world, are in an uproar of hostility





against them; persons who regard them with perfect tranquillity, are represented as leagued for their eternal ruin; their persecutions are more mischievous, hecause they are not violent; adder's poison is under their lips when they smile, and their kiss is the kiss of Judas. The spiritual mail must not be unlocked, nor the arm relaxed for a moment: all the universe is in arms against the repose of a garret, which is not perhaps visited but by the foot of its inmate; and amid these menaces of danger, and clamours of encouragement, the initiated walk on enchanted ground, and see Satan fall, like lightening from Heaven, at his progress. Whether this be a just statement of the positions of Revelation I do not propose to examine, but its effects on me were all that could be expected from the union of fancy and passion, with a system of religion that flattered both.

These men of whom I spoke, had





marked my pensive and solitary habits, my diffidence, my absence, and perhaps a certain consciousness of something above the common meditations of youth; they immediately marked me down as a convert, and to make a convert of me was not difficult. The change was flattering to other than religious feelings. Every man naturally feels a degree of envy, mixed with latent dislike, to characters eminent for learning or piety. 'Tis a natural jealousy of a superiority which is determined by no intrinsic principle, but effected by accident or by habit. 'Tis common I believe to all minds, but it is inseparable from minds of grasp and ambition. It was peculiarly the failing of mine.

But to see myself in one moment, by an instantaneous and voluntary change of opinions, enabled to look down with that contemptuous pity which lurking « hatred loves to indulge, on those whose





proficiency in the paths of excellence seemed hitherto to have left me at an invidious distance, to sit shaking an head of angry despondency, under sermons that edified a numerous and enlightened congregation; and to pray with splenetic zeal for mercy on the sleeping watchmen, who were at the very moment defending their post with the vigour of talent, and the zeal of talent:—to do this, was but too gratifying to the jealous and petulant pride of young men, over whom the authority they decryed, held an immediate and biting controul, whose recollection aggravated their bitterness. But there was employment sometimes for better feelings in our assemblies; the studious perusal of the Scriptures, the effusion of youthful eloquence, the contagion of mutual exhortation, and the ardour of general devotion, communicated to us sensations that I yet remember with pleasure, though not convinced that their





source was either in reason or devotion. The spirit of our institution was concentred and kept alive, by an habit which is inseparable from such a system—the habit of compassing sea and land to make a proselyte. Our method was very simple and summary; the heir of a feudal house in Scotland was compelled to empty an horn that contained a gallon, in proof of his having attained the age to claim the honors of his ancestors: we compelled our convert to swallow a long and galling draught from the fountain of Calvin, as a test of his proficiency. We delighted to make the stammerer pronounce the kibboleth of a language, of which he yet knew not the elements nor the articulation. I shall give a short specimen of our mode of conversion—it was an unsuccessful attempt of my own; I displayed before my catechumen the whole armory of Calvinistic warfare.

G 5





1 concluded with placing before him the rubicon of predestination, which if once passed, I hoped forbad all retreat. He was a lad of plain intellects; he was shocked and alarmed. "You must believe predestination," said I. "'Tis . impossible," srid he. "Tis impossible that you should hope for safety else," said I. "I can never believe it," said he. "You will be damned if you do not," said I. "Why then damn me if I do,"

said he. I never saw him more.- 1

only mention these circumstances, because in describing my character, I would describe the causes which contributed to its peculiarities, because I would have some calculation of the force, and some indulgence for the excesses of an enthu'siasm, which was at once the enthusiasm of nature, politics, and religion.

But my enthusiasm was not long to be the dream of solitude. Before 1 had





been a year in Dublin, I received a letter from my father, informing me, he and his family were on their way to Ireland; that he had a seat in the west, to which he proposed retiring, and taking me with him, that I might acquire the habits of a country resident, and conciliate the favor of my uncle, on whom much depended. This letter left enough open to solicitude; it neither informed me of the number, nor relations of the family, with whom I was to domesticate, nor any thing relating to this important uncle. But my mind expanded at a change of situation, and J felt at the approach of new relatives, the hope and fear of affection.

From the person with whom I lived, I could learn nothing: my father, though a native of Ireland, had not resided in it since his youth, so I was compelled to pacify myself by wishes, and calculations^ and incessant perusals of the letter, in which no diligence could discover aflection. The vessel in which they embarked for Dublin, from some part of the coast of Lancaster, was so beset by unfavorable winds, that they.were at length compelled to land in an obscure port in the north of Ireland; and my father, exhausted by fatigue and illness, determined to travel by slow stages across the country to' his western villa:—alike averse from the distresses of navigation, or the tumults of Dublin. He sent his Frenchman in his chariot to acquaint me with this arrangement, and to desire me to join him in Connaught as soon as possible. I obeyed him directly.





My fellow-traveller appeared likely to gratify the feelings with which my heart was swelling. He was my father's confidential servant, he had lived with him many years, and he had all the communicativeness of his nation. "i

But with the true officious politeness of a Frenchman, he would speak nothing but English, though I wished to converse with him in his native tongue, which I spoke with sufficient fluency, and in compliment to me he persisted in talking bad English with a French accent and idiom, in preference to a medium of language common to us both. With the communicativeness, he united much of the superficial knowledge of a Frenchman, he had been intimate with many parts of life. He was a vehement aristocrat, and execrated the modern regime.





He began by repeating some fragments of the classics which he had learned while a porter at one of the foreign colleges, and expatiated on the beneficial effects of a system in those seminaries, which compelled the students to get a great part of the classics off by heart, as an exercise of memory. I observed that the University of Dublin paid more attention to the cultivation of sciences than of languages.





He replied, ." It was then a pity that the University of Dublin did not adopt the Marchioness du Chatelet's comment on Newton's philosophy."—" Is it not still better, monsieur, that we study Newton in his own text ?"—" Ah non, monsieur, Newton was a very weak writer, he said some good things, but depend on it be never would have been noticed but for the Marchioness du Chatclet."

"I understood," said I " Newton was sufficiently popular, before he had the honor of being noticed by the marchioness." "1 can assure you, monsieur," said he, "that lie would never have been known in France, but for that fortunate event."

I now found that Fi ance and the world were synonimous in the language of a Frenchman. After this national defeat, I attempted to lead up another column of literature, and observed that the English had improved so math in polite letters since the institution of their colleges, that it was to he lamented part of the collegiate studies, did not include the classical compositions in their own language. M. Masseau admitted that our polite literature must have undergone some improvement since the reign of Queen Anne, " For,"said he " about that time you might have learned to compose tragedies, ar one of your authors was prompted by the good genius of your nation to translate Racine's Andromaque. Another, I believe, attempted to communicate to you the beauties of Corueille's Cid, and before that," said he, "I believe Mr. Dry den attempted to translate Du Fiesnoy's Art of Painting." In vain I endeavoured to undeceive him with regard to these productions, and assure him that many English tragedies were held in higher value than the translations he .mentioned. To strike me dumb, he reminded me that the Cid had been translated by (Cibber ) the laureat, as a resistless argument of the dignity of the undertaking, for in the imagination of this homme de vielle cour, whatever was connected with royalty must be great, and a work translated by the poet laureat must have been a work to which the nation looked up for delight and illumination. To prove that we were not wholly unacquainted with the tone of poetry before the date he mentioned, I at length ventured to pronounce the names of Shakespeare and Milton. He started with evident displeasure, but recovering himself, observed that Milton might have polished his native barbarism, as he understood he had passed some time at Paris during his tour: "mais, monsieur," added he, " what poetry could be expected from a man who hated kings, and wore latchets in his shoes?" I observed that the manners of a court (par





ticularly that of Charles the 2d) had little conciliating in them to the purity of Milton's mind." "It was the only civilized court England ever saw/' replied M. Masseau, "the manners were perfectly French."

This was unanswerable. Of Shakespeare he spoke as indignantly as ever Voltaire did. "That author," said he, "has not more than a scene or two in rhime in any one of his plays."

I ventured to ask was it not possible that poetry could speak any language but that of rhime; he stared at me as if I wanted to new-model his creed, and then answered, "When did you hear, monsieur, of the French tragedians, having used any other?" Weary of his dogmatising, I turned the discourse to my family. He said, it consisted of my father, mademoiselle his daughter, and her governess. I asked with a burning cheek, if my father had been married.





"Non, monsieur, he was un homme des bonnes fortunes, he had many arrangements, and would never have known the number of his children, had not un malheur triste compelled him to inquire into how many chances of comfort were left him." "What malheur was so fortunate for his family!" said I.—" He had a son, monsieur, the finest youth in the world, whom he had with him from the first, and whom he was fond of a la folic They lived in France, and lived like brothers; they had their separate arrangements; they neither envied nor censured each other ; it was a spectacle of improvement for the whole world. At length, the horrid revolution drove them from France; they came to England, and imagined they still might live, as in Fiance. But. who could dream of living comme un bonne te homme dans ce pays barbare?

"An English Milord was so savage as to observe some attentions your brother was in the habit of paying to his wife. He challenged him, they fought, and mon pauvre maitre fell on the first fire. I carried home the body to Monsieur, and assured him that his son had fallen, covered with glory.





"Monsieur was at first overcome by the shock, he threw himself on the corse, and in his despair used some expressions, altogether unworthy the greatness of his soul ; he accused himself as the murderer of his child, and bewailed the example, whose influence had led him to end a life of vice by an untimely death. As for me, I wept, I lamented, I made myself unhappy a thousand ways, but still I remembered that the young Monsieur B, had perished, as every homme galant would wish. After this, your father's spirits and health declined rapidly; I did every thing I could, I prepared les petits soupers, and les petits Jillettes as usual .





But he had lost all relish for either! in fact he soon conceived the idea of collecting the remains of his family, and retiring with them to Ireland. I expressed a sensible regret at this resolution, which he mistook for an unwillingness to accompany him. He therefore offered me a splendid douceur, and a thousand thanks for my services. But a Frenchman knows not how to leave a master who values a Frenchman. Penetrated with the most lively despair at the thoughts of deserting him, I threw myself at his feet, and declared my resolution to follow him, even to Ireland. I by no means despair of passing a tolerable life even here; every where there are means of pleasure to a Frenchman, and to make perpetual pleasures for myself, fait tout ma philosophic. ** When I looked at the little shrivelled figure, which, in all the deformity of old age, aggravated by the extreme of antiquated fashion, promised itself "per





Detual pleasures/' I could hardly suppress i smile. He observed it, and supposing t excited by his vivacity, began to give Droofs of it, I could have dispensed with; be sung chansons d'amour in a voice that Irowned the rattle of the wheels, and svhen we stopped for the first night, requested to have the honor of discovering 'or me some petit demoiselle, pour passer e temps."

I declined his services, and the colour vhich I could not prevent mounting to ny very forehead, filled him with a sur>rise which was very visibly mingled with contempt.

On the evening of the second day, we tassed through Banagher, a town at the extremity of Leinster, at whose foot lows the Shannon, dividing that province Vom Connaught.

We crossed a bridge of some antiquity, :nd were in the west of Ireland. For ome way, the toad, following the windings of the Shannon, and varied by the eminences on its shores, was beautiful. Delighted with the contrast between these green and winding roads, and the joyless bogs of the King's County, I gazed about me, till Masseau pointing out to me on the bank of the river a cluster of ash and poplar, among which rose the roof of a villa, informed me that was my father's residence. He had called it Lemon-grove from a sickly imitation of the luxuriant verdure of France, which he had endeavoured to introduce into the plantations. I sprung from the carriage with an heart that longed to love. I saw none but servants: after some inquiry, Masseau learned that my father had retired to his room, that this was a signal for universal silence, that Madame la . Gouvernante had therefore gone to her study where she usually passed her evenings, and my sister to her apartment, which neither of them quitted till the





first signs of life were given from the invalid's chamber next morning.

I threw myself on a sopha dispirited; the servants approached to inquire if I wanted any thing, I answered myself, "A father willing however to conciliate him by an early obedience to his modes of life, I desired to be shewn to my room; it was twilight, and while the servant went for candles, I heard a light step approaching the room, I raised my head, a female figure stood tremblingly at the door. "If you are my brother," said a soft voice, " tell me so, for I have risked much to see you to-night." I rose, and approached her, we had never met before; but the confidence of nature was in our hearts; we embraced, and expressed our delight at meeting, and when we had done so, repeated it again: for mutual ignorance precluded communication, we had nothing to ask or relate but our joy.





Lights were now brought in; I drew my sister to the seat from which I had risen, and gazed on her; her age appeared about my own, her figure slight, her face pale, her manners timid and dejected. She had no beauty but of expression, and no graces but those of simplicity and affection. "My father," said she, "is a wretched invalid. He passes the day in pain, and the night in sleeplessness; of what rest he can get, he is therefore very covetous, and we retire early that it may not be disturbed, but I am sure when he sees you he will love you; only enter his room quietly, and take care not to praise the climate. As to Miss Percival, you will find it not so easy to conciliate, or rather to conquer her, for she is a great disputant, and the most terrible scholar breathing; she gives no quarter, and death or victory must be your motto, if you engage with her. But she is a woman of great talents no doubt, as my constant 4





head-aches can testify. Dear, dear Ormsby, how I have longed for a brother/ or any thing to love in this place: there is so much reasoning, and no conviction, and so much indisposition, without any tenderness, that I think I scarce have had an happy moment till this." This happiness however we were afraid to prolong; we again whispered our joy and affection, and separated.





CHAPTER IV.

I Waited in the morning, like a schoolboy who expects to be called to a task. I was at length summoned to breakfast, at which I found my sister presiding, and Miss Percival reading. The latter possessed traces of distinguished beauty still diffused over a form no longer young, and evidently impaired by ill-health. She addressed me with more emotion than I expected-, which however she instantly suppressed. "I don't know to what hours you are accustomed, Ormsby," said Sybilla, attempting domestic conversation, "but I conjectured that as a traveller you would not like to be summoned too early." "How often have I told you," said Miss P. "to consider the division of lime is voluntary and artificial, one of -the numerous abuses of the present system





low absurd to conceive an union between the calls of appetite or any other f the animal functions, and the motions f a clock." "I only apprehended my rother might be fatigued/' said Sybilla. There is no such thing as fatigue," said Tiss P. "Fatigue is only an acknowtedgelent that matter predominates over mind; a acknowledgement, extorted not from :uthj but from weakness: were the mind jfficicntly abstracted in ifspeculiar operaons, 'tis highly possible that a man might e running fiill speed all his life, without eing conscious of it, and go round the orld -for the same purpose that others sit own to study." I affected to admire this improvement on the Peripatetic philoso* hy, but the lady disclaimed any resemlarice, she spoke of the ancients with jntempt; " What," said she, "could be le result of efforts made by beings, of hom many believed in a God, and some ^en held the utility of religion?





1



reserved for this age to be blest by fhe instructions of sages, who first unfolded the omnipotence of mind, the perfectibility of man, the mortality of the soul, and the non-existence of an intelligent cause. But alas!" she continued, "what has been the reward of their zeal, and the result of their labours! some of them have been pumped, some put in the pillory, many hissed and pelted from the tribunes, whence they were about to dispense illumination, and many driven to the great western wilderness, to sow the seeds of intellectual regeneration, amid the unsophisticated sons of nature, whom we terra the savages of North and South America." Sybilla threw up her eyes in painful resignation; at this moment my father's bell rung, and Masseau came in to inform me, he would see me, a summons I expected with impatience still. As I hesitatec at his door, I would have given a worlr for positive instructions, how to approacb





him, and please him by my approach, but when it was opened, I yielded to the impulse that thrilled through mc, and rushing forward, I knelt by his knee, and called him, "Father."

"Vastly well, vastly well indeed/said he in a weak, querulous tone, "you have been instructed to do all this, and you do honor to your instructions." "I hope I do," said I rising, and recovering myself, "for my instructor was my Owh heart."

"Are you so anxious to display that you are six feet high," said he sharply, "that you cannot bear the posture of affection for one moment?" "Oh tell me only what posture to assume, what language to speak, tell me but what will please you, and"-—

"You have asked a most painful question, 1 know not what can please mc, I wish I could discover it myself; perhaps with your assistance—but no—no—it would be cursed meanness in me to he pleased with what I can enjoy, now, when I have lost all'that is worth enjoying." "And I have just found all I would wish to enjoy." "What is that I" "A parent.'* "True, and m most detectable circumstances, just where every tall, florid, forward boy of sixteen would wish to find a parent, feeble, and sickly, and dispirited, that he may insult him with his youth and spirit; tell' me now plainly, a'nt you proud of the contrast between us "I am, for I feel proud of the powers that may be employed for your amusement, for your recovery." He looked at me earnestly, the flush of speaking was over, my face was on fire with tears and blushes; "I have half a mind to punish you by taking you at your word, and making you give me my drops this moment." I turned round eagerly to Masseau for the drops; the good-natured Frenchman gave them to me as eagerly, my father swallowed them from





my hand. "A Ganymede/' said he; "but curse me if you can convert ether and laudanum iuto nectar. But go away, child, (for remember a child you must be to please me) go away, for you are too like your brother Everard in every motion, except that he never offered to give me my drops."

The family did not assemble till dinner, then the conflict commenced, to which Sybilla had alluded; the perpetual conflict of jarring opinions, and feelings, and habits.- Yet I Was still so unacquainted with them, that I attended more to their persons than their conversation. My father was a diminutive figure, whose motions, when not distorted by pain, possessed exquisite grace, and whose manners, when not discoloured by the gloom of ill-health and spleen, displayed the most dazzling polish of artificial suavity. A slight observation confirmed the character his letters indicated..





He was an enervated libertine, who had lost the pleasures of sense, and had no others to supply their place; yet he was sufficiently intellectual to feel the abuse of early advantages, and had sensibility enough to feel that he might have acquired virtue and happiness: but the conviction came too late to bring any thing but pain to a mind vitiated by indulgence, and embittered by disease. His pride and his habits alike forbad him to believe that there were pleasures which he had not enjoyed; he loathed the idea of moderate enjoyment, or domestic peace; he shrunk from the names of sensibility, affection, or worth, because he hated to reproach himself with their past neglect, and feared to be reminded of their future responsibility.

He treated all pretensions to qualities which he had not possessed or valued as affectation and imposture, and gave every one credit for the vices he had practised





whether guilty of them or not. "Every man/' he often said, "would be luxurious, if like him he could afford lux- . uries; every man would like liim be a libertine, if he had the same exquisite perceptions of pleasure." Of what remained to him, he appeared sufficiently jealous; he dressed himself with the most expensive elegance, and covered his table with such delicacies as I had never before beheld, and of which in the intervals of pain he partook with a voracity that often renewed it in the very aet: this, however, instead of checking him only suggested curses against his cook or his wine-hier- chant, to whose defects and adulterations he charged all he suffered, and then hastened to prepare himself by medicine for another repetition of indulgence and pain. But pain was not the only impediment to his indulgences: Miss P. never lost an opportunity of admonition •md reproof, which these seasons afforded





her; and though she performed every little office about him with a minuteness of attention, which surprised me as much as the freedom she was allowed in her severity, yet she indemnified herself for the trouble by incessant declamation against the mischief of luxury, and the meanness of appetite.

All dinner-time was passed in altercation, to which Sjbilla listened silently from fear,, and I from amazement. The scene too was sufficiently strange; my father seated in his velvet chair, enveloped in his pelisse, and surrounded by French servants, who had scarce time to carry back and forwards the variety of things he tasted and dismissed; and to answer with shrugs the "diable" and "peste" with which they were greeted at every step. . .

On the other side, Miss P. in an attitude that could neither be called sitting: nor leaning; her plate the furthest thif%'





from her at the table, reading intently, and every morsel she swallowed, lamenting the suspension of intellectual operation. "If you can cut that chicken pie," said my father, "send me some of it. I would have it brought to me; but this etourdi bete would derange ail the liqueur."

"If the human mind were in the exercise of its full powers, your wish would bring the pie to you, as easily as it would bring the chicken to your mouth, were it on your plate. But how long shall we be condemned to regret the predominance of* matter over mind?"— "We have no reason to regret the predominance of matter in your discourses. But what the devil are you using the handle of the fork for instead of the prongs?"—" Why," said Miss P. "do the Chinese use neither knife nor fork? Why do the Abvssinians use a knife with their ringers? Why"—" Oh! curses and confusion," said my father, "now for an hour of declamation, and the pie will be cold; who but you ever thought of reasoning at a dinner-table; is reason necessary to handle a knife and fork, or to move the jaws?"





"Undoubtedly it is," replied the lady, "it is our privilege to reason on every part of life. Does not reason assist me to refute your complaints, does not reason dictate my replies?"—" No, upon my soul, it does not," said my father, relieving his pain by a sneer. "It is impossible," he continued, filling his mouth, "this can do me good, while, like Pistol in the play, I am compelled to 'eat and swear' at every mouthful."—" Anger," said Miss P. "as it contributes to ferment the animal juices, may probably contribute to trituration and digestion." —" By Heaven, you talk of man as if he were a machine."—" '.Tis you who rather wish to consider woman as a machine."—" So I do," said my father with bitterness, "a machine of fortune." —" We have always differed in our sensations of pain, because we differ in our ideas of it. But if I am allowed to define"——" Excuse me, I beg; if I am spared the definition of pain, I shall probably escape the sensation."





"It is impossible to reason with you. The woman who could communicate with your ideas, mutt be utterly destitute of any herself; she must be a domestic drudge, broken by the slavery of common life, and the misfortune of a religious education."—" Religious education," said my father, arguing from his oton ideas, "is no misfortune on earth to a woman. Some of the finest women I ever knew in France were immensely religious, and were just as punctual at mass as at their assignations." Here the arrival of the second course presenting a pair of ducks a la rohan, engaged his whale attention; and Miss P. read anl7 reasoned seule for the remainder of the meal; which the dessert, and a variety of liqueurs and wines, protracted for-nearlv three hours.





When this b usiness was at length Coitcluded, my father would willingly have tried to sleep; hut' it was necessary for him then to attempt to take some exercise. He had been desired to qualify the indulgences of the table, by taking a. few turns in the garden after it. This was a terrible moment to him; he looked wistfully around, drained his last glass, sighed heavily, and rose from his chair. The garden, which sloped to the brink of the river, sheltered and shaded by the boughs of every light and water-loving; tree, was a spot to tempt the wanderings of a voluptuary; but my father had now no sense but that of taste; the pure air chilled him, and the rich, soft colourings of the sky and earth \yere tinged by the





complexion of his mind. His feelings were very peculiar. The strength of youth and spirit was necessary to support his existence; yet youth- and spirit offended him, for he was still jealous of his personal advantages, which had once hecn eminent; and he believed youth and animation were only displayed-to insult him. I had hastened, forward to offer him my arm, (when he attempted to walk) but he rejected it after an angry comparison between his nature and mine. He then leaned on Masseau for a few moments; hut finding my steps firrner than those of his old domestic, returned to me again;: but told rae there was no occasion that I should stoop to him in that, invidious manner.

I wished to suspend his uneasiness and my own, and poured out my praise on the objects that were around us, delightiftil as they were to the eye of novelty, a»d the mind of youth, with all the lavishness of natural pleasure. He checked me with impatience. "I cannot endure to hear you. If it were so, why does it not strike my feelings as it does yours? I will not believe that others can feel pleasure where I feel only weariness and disgust. 'Tis the language of a schoolboy, a language you must unlearn, as you have learned it. I talked it once myself as fluently as you; but even when I talked, I did not believe it. These things are purely mechanical; as long as the senses minister to the mind, the mind must depend on their ministry.





"Eschylus got drunk to compose his tragedies. The Venus of Apelles was said to have fed upon roses. Another worthy of antiquity was said to be 'ebrius nectare.' I try to talk the language of a schoolboy on your account; but I will now talk the language of a.moralist. To every man whose appetite is good, and rest undisturbed; whose enjoyment of life is never diminished by sleeplessness or indigestion, the sky is for ever tinged with blue, and the whole system of things is unexceptionable. This is the true Claude Lorrainetint of life. Burgundy gives its own blush to every object you see through it. The great secret of happiness is the combination of youth and pleasure with health; and when the former and latter have departed, (as they must) try still to retain the middle one. Our very virtues are only another name for the effects of a good meal on a good frame of health, under the influence of an exhilarating atmosphere.





'f;This is the whole of it; it sickens me to hear of sensibility and affection, natural or artificial, &c. &c.—Who ever was benevolent amid the rage of hunger? Try if you could listen to the most affecting tale of calamities under the rigours of a polar night. Ask a man irT the par-oxjsms of gout to shed a tear for any one's distresses but his' own. Ask a benighted traveller to pause over the sadness of a sentiment amid the rage of a storm. All our sensibility is-the bastard offspring of pride and indolence. Reposing on our couches to- satiety, we wish to diversify our sensations by artificial uneasiness, and therefore pretendto feel for visionary sufferings.





"But real pain soon cures us of onr affectation; and real pleasure (if we could know what it is,) would perhaps cure us of pretensions to- imaginary ones. You pretended a few minutes ago to dislike the wine I pressed you to take: and now you pretend to luxuriate in what you call 'the rich and weeping softness of a watery landscape.' This is all nonsense and self-imposture. Ghampaigne ( when it is good, I mean) has always the same j>owcr of stimulating the spirits,. thoughtrees and water have not. for (hcv have lost their power of stimulating mine long ago. And it is to be hoped when you come to my years, that is, I mean to my





pshaw!—experience—you will look

upon nature with the same disgust that I do/1 This was spoken at intervals; but with an emphasis and deliberation that shocked- and distressed me. I tried to soothe him, however, fbr I hoped his words had been extorted by the acrimony of pain: I admitted that much indulgence must he allowed to. one who suffered so much, and that-the spirits of an invalid required the resources of even artificial enjoyment. "I have none others left me," said he with violence, and panting with the burden of intemperance; "if all the pleasures of man were those of temperance and exercise, what would become of me?

"I hardly keep on the level of existence with all the aids that indulgence can. give me. The best cook I could procure for enormous wages to come with me to this cursed country, can hardly excite my appetite. Along with my coffee I regularly drink the most potent liqueurs I can swallow; yet my digestion and sleep are still disturbed. What would become of me if I were to be temperate? I who have an imposthume in my head, an obstructed respiration an abscess in my side, and—hell in my heart."





I listened with horror and compassion. I was softened or terrified even to tearslie observed it, but observed it only with scorn. "You may abate your consternation," said he; "you mean by that word, something, that the nurse and the priest have taught; I mean only something that my sufferings in this world have taught me, and which I shall probably forget as soon as I quit it. I have long been. assured there was no other heaven than a quiet rest after a good burner; and no other hell than the privation of enjoyment, without the privation of desire." I was now shocked to a degree that impelled me to change the subject; and I spoke eagerly of my uncle and of the neighbourhood, of which -however I knew nothing, "I wanted to talk to you of your uncle," said he, ff and you compelled me to speak of my own feelings.





"Your uncle is my elder brother, though not of the same name; for I changed mine for the property of a maternal uncle which I inherit. Your uncle is a Milesian, and like all Milesians, proud and dull; but unlike most Milesians, amazingly rich.

"He has no children, he is old, much older than I am. He has a nephew who resides with him; but he is,our sister's son, and thanks to your uncle's Milesian prejudice in favor of male descent, he will probably prefer you, as his brothcr's child, to any other competitor for his favor. Observe me, Ormsby; were you independent, I would -consider him and his favor as an object for you to quiz and ridicule; but you have nothing. Let not the appearance I make deceive you. I have sunk the whole of my property for an annuity; the house in which I live will, and every inch of ground about it, be alienated at my death. My "age—not my age, I mean, but my infirmities, require much indulgence; I considered that, and considered I had the best right to indulgence from myself. I can hardly afford myself Burgundy as it is; this cursed war with France has deranged the whole business of life. I could drink Champaigne ten years ago for the price I give for vin de grave now. You see therefore it is necessary I should make some sacrifice. Expect nothing from me; but if you manage well, expect every tiling from your uncle.**





^ was trying to comprehend his meaning; :I was trying to conceive that a parent could nurse a child in luxury, whom he meant to expose to indigence, when a tumult of voices, in which Sybilla-s was predominant, recalled u« to the dining-room, whose windows descending to the ground, communicated with the garden. Sybilla was contending with Miss Percrval with a vehemence of which I hardly thought her capable. "This is a species of oppression to which I will not submit, madam," said she; "I insist upon having at least an hour to mvself in the evening, and that hour I will devote to the study of the Scriptures. At the school where I have lived happily many years, it was the habit of my life; it has now, from an habit, become a duty; but neither; as an habit nor duty shall it be suspended. You may deride me; but insensibility to unjust censure, is one of the first les





sons of that book you would take from 'me."—" If you had been satisfied with calling the study of that work an habit, and reasoned for its propriety from the force of habit merely, I could not oppose you. We all admit the force of habit. One of our first and greatest writers* maintains, that habit may hold so strong an influence over an old woman living with a band of robbers, and accustomed to their atrocities, that any attampt to shake her conviction of the rectitude of her mode of life, would be as ineffectual as to eradicate the belief of revelation from a mind hardened in its belief by age and habit. He intimates, indeed, that the errors of both are equally absurd; and the habits of mind ia both merely mechanical."

"Nor will I," said Sybilla, more intent on her owa vexations, than Miss

P.'s reasoning; "nor will I," said she, pushing away her drawing desk, "be made to study those odious nude figures you bring me; nakedness is what I never wished to contemplate in my own person, or any one else's." "You show a most alarming impurity of mind/' said Miss P——; "our shame of nakedness is merely a shame of our own ideas; drapery is only an apology for that want of modesty, which the mind in its present state, while clothes are permitted, must ever want; were the soul in a pure and perfect state of abstraction, it would be utterly unconscious, not only of nakedness, but of the existence of a body at all.—The more we approach to this state, the further we remove from shame: read the writings of the modern philosophers, and you will be convinced they have very little either of shame or fear." "If' you will permit her," said my father, who never lost an opportunity of snoer

TOL. I. I





ing at the Bible, "to study that old Jewish Fabulist she is so fond of, she will be reconciled by the discovery her first parents were naked and not ashamed." "God bless me," said SybiHa in serious distress—she collected herself and addressed my father almost with dignity. "Believe me, sir, if you respect your own authority, you will not weaken its Only permanent support. The books that Miss P. and you sanction, are such at would justify me in rejecting a controul from which I derive little beside pain, were I not withheld by the authority of that book, which allowing no compromise for disobedience, commands children to obey their parents in all things, which draws no sanction from the mutable motives of the human will; but tells us, it is good and acceptable in the eyes of the Lord." My father rung for his drops— I had been silent, but I could be so no longer.





I took Sybilla's hand—" If you, sir, can see this with indifference, I cannot; I have been taught to respect modesty, and to reverence religion. Pardon me if I say, I see little temptation to relinquish my opinions, from the examples of those who oppose them; I claim impunity for my sister and myself while we live with you. The alternative would be much easier to me than to hear the Being whom I worship— defied; and the sex whom I honor, and the only being of that sex whom I love, insulted or contaminated.".

In the flush of speaking, I drew Sybilla from the room—we found ourselves in the garden before we knew we had quitted it. This burst of passion must be forgiven me. I was eminently ignorant of life, and of the mode of palliating the passions of others or my own. I had passed successively from an house of solitude and privacy, to a cottage in the wilds of Cumberland, thence to a retired family in Dublin; the influence of whose habits had been -increased by the austerities of recent fanaticism, for such hva measure was the religious system I had acquired in Dublin. From thence I had been hastily removed to the country, and in every place through which I had passed, I had been approached with a kind of distant reserve, and invested with a species of solitary grandeur, that exalted my pride, and inflamed my romantic singularity of mind almost to wildness. I was as impatient of contradiction, as one who had heard little but submission, and as jealous of my innocence and purity, as one who knew vice only by its report.





I consoled Sybilla as well as I could, and confirmed her in her resistance of corruption; we had no very distinct ideas of what we were to contend for, but we determined to contend as for existence and all its work; we resolved on regular hours of religious study, and condoled with





and commended each other.—It was now night, and we returned to the house like criminals, though conscious of integrity. My father and Miss P. had retired—as we past through the hall, a servant in a gorgeous and clumsy livery bowed very low to me, and wished me "a thousand years of life." His tone struck ine; I enquired who he was — he was a servant of . my uncle's, who came from the Castle (about five miles distant) with an invitation to a family dinner on the following day. i/ understood this was occasioned by the intelligence of my arrival. I was anxious to see the old Irish Chieftain, and to be acquainted with modes of fife which appear to the inmates of. England like the visions of romance. I was overjoyed to hear on the following morning that the invitation was accepted, and the more so, as it indicated that my father had forgot the sally of the night before, of which I had indeed repented





while uttering it. Miss P., however, was too philosophic to retain the memory of what had passed the night before, and my father was soothed into good-humour by a night of tranquillity. My uncle and his castle deserve a chapter to themselves.





CHAPTER V.

In the morning Capt. Deloraine (the other nephew of whom my father spoke) came from the Castle to wait on me before my appearance there; this attention from a man so much my senior, for D. was seven or eight and twenty, flattered my boyish vanity. It was not without some degree of confusion, I met a man whom J had been instructed to supplant; but the sight of Deloraine was enough to banish all confusion. There was a bold and chearfnl openness, a candour both natural and professional about him, which won all eyes and minds that encountered. His person and air were military, his fare was that of a man, who thought more thaa D. seemed to think; but I resigned my pretensions to physiognomy, sooner than admit any defect in the character I had imagined of him. My father set out for the Castle in the chariot, accompanied by Sybilla; Deloraine and I rode; Miss P. declined going. I was delighted with my companion; his information was trivial, but he communicated it with a vivacity that enchanted a boy.





"These great houses you see to the left," said he, "have every reason to look desolate, they are the property of absentees. Lord Westhampton and Lord Roschamp draw large revenues from their Irish estates, which the former never visits, and the latter only to rack his overracked tenants to their uttermost farthing. He is a famous fellow however, and gives amazing good dinners, and keeps the whole country in an uproar while he stays. My uncle does not visit him, as he has unluckily discovered that his lordship's great uncle was mar





ried to his grandfather's foster-sister.— He says, English peers have no business to intrude into the families of Irish Chieftains. Farther to the left, you may see Hammond's-grove; if that Hammond did not keep his mistress and her brood in the house., and make every one that dines with him drink so infernally, it would be a capital lounge in this desolate place. He lias a legitimate son, a fine fellow, only devilish squeamish; whom he, or his habits, have driven from the house."

I was caught by the name, and eagerly inquired particulars of young Hammond; it was the friend of my childhood. I cherished the thought that we should yet take sweet counsel together, and confirm ourselves in mutual rectitude.

We now passed a building so dreary, that it hardly seemed the habitation of man. "That," said Deloraine, "is the haunted house; every rustic neighbour hood has its spectres, living or dead: perhaps, if you could see the inmate of that mansion, you would hardly know which to pronounce him. He is a man who lives alone, some say, in consequence of his crimes; some say, in consequence of his misfortunes: as for me, I know so liitle of solitude, it is impossible for me to pronounce what could determine any man to chuse it. I believe I have bored you enough in my office of Diable Boiteux; but we are now within sight of the castle, and I cannot lay it down without one caution. Your uncle has all the peculiarities of a Milesian, and one that no Milesian but himself ever 'had. He cannot bear assent. To be 'obligingly flat,' is to disoblige him for ever. He loves to hear English manners and modern habits defended, that he may have the pleasure of refuting them. He is only to be pleased by contradiction; but, remember, if you assign me as the authority for your knowledge of his character, I am blown for ever; for he loves to have it discovered after repeated mistakes and disappointments, which I have interrupted to spare time, and you—au revoir."





I was profuse in my thanks; but on the scene I was approaching, I wished my whole attention to be fixed—the castle of an Irish Chieftain and his family. I had seen nothing yet of the peculiar and national features of the Irish, I soon disci) vered the reason. The Irish are easily repelled by strangers. About my father's house, the fame of whose French household had travelled round the country, not an Irish face was to be seen; every thing about the Chieftain's castle bore the aspect I looked for. The people were as sallow, and meagre, and ill-clad, as any where else; but there was an expression of animated cordiality, a warmth of heart that illuminated the face of the

re





meanest of them, that indicated the influence of the presence.of a chief who loved them, and whom they loved.■ The castle, a hold rude mass of structure, whose strength was more than proportioned to its size, stood on' a" island spot of cultivated ground, surrounded by bogs; a bare-foOted boy ran before us to open the gate, which admitted us into an inclosure, where a number of sheep feeding, strongly contrasted the rude and warlike range of walls that surrounded the castle. The principal gate here had been out of repair for some years; the chief, however, was satisfied, by seeing workmen prepare to go to it every Monday morning; in the mean time a car was placed across, to facilitate the progress of foot-passengers, over the masses of stone that lay scattered around it; and we were obliged to dismount, and lead our horses through a yard which communicated with the kitchens, and which was filled by an army of followers feeding in idleness and plenty.





We ascended the great stairs; at the upper-end of a dark, spacious', ill-furnished room, the Chieftain was seated in an huge chair of wicker, from which no man who wished for a picture of antiquity would have bid him rise; my father, who was there already, introduced me. "You are welcome," said he, and his voice made me feel I was. I never beheld hoary grandeur more awful; I .feel some reluctance in attempting to describe this noble old ruin: the Irish character has been much exaggerated.

They who speak of a Milesian chief, describe him a being, obsolete as Brien Boirn, or Fingal; as a being, who talks the language of Ossian, and wears the robes of a bard. I cannot overstep the modesty of nature in my description, for I have seen and known the man whom I describe. He was a man, whose strong and characteristic peculiarities were partly softened by age, and partly shaded by the influence of the manners of the day; an influence which he would never acknowledge.





He was seventy-six years of age, but he was as upright as the towers of his own castle, and his intellects were as vigorous as his frame; his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated; his hair, which flowed loose and wild, was as white as snow; his dress was the English habit of fifty years ago; but he always wore a cloak of the brightest scarlet, whose - folds he grasped and waved, when he spoke with animation. His demeanour was marked with dignity, but it was a wild and original dignity; that of a chief of a warlike country, lofty with unborrowed grandeur and habitual command; amid the polished forms of modern life, he looked the oak, amid the poplar and the willow.

%'





At dinner, my admiration was withdrawn from his person to his conversation. It appeared, he had passed much of his youth abroad; he spoke French, Italian, Spanish; he was acquainted with their literature and their politics; he spoke of them with toleration, but of Ireland with enthusiasm. Such a man gives to a listener the same pleasure, that a traveller would receive from visiting a building, whose sombrous antiquity promised nothing but gloom and decay; but who, on entering it, would find all splendid with illumination, and luxurious with elegance; yet, all modulated by the gracious melancholy, and tinged with the hoary complexion of the original structure. Without a wish to excite him by opposition, when the dessert appeared, I could not avoid wondering, that a man who had drank of the rich fruitage of France, could accustom himself to the cold productions of his own climate.





"Young man," said he, "when my appetites were more keen, I would have exchanged all the grapes of France, and the almonds of Spain, for a single apple from the garden of my father's * house." The dinner, though as good as my father could wish, was marked by circumstances sufficiently characteristic. When the turf-basket, which always stands on the hearth, required to be filled, a barefooted boy came into the room, who did not appear from his embarrassment, "to have never before stood in such a presence."

The whole of dinner-time, the Chieftain was accosted by persons who entered and departed abruptly; and who by their action (for the conversation was in Irish) appeared to speak of business, and whom he answered, as if the interruption was a common one; almost as soon as dinner was over, the Chieftain

* Taken from life.





beckoned to his confessor, a venerable and decent priest, whose pale face was tinged with something more than religious melancholy, and they withdrew together, evidently for the purposes of . devotion, the Chieftain making a slight apology for his absence, at which my father was not angry, as Deloraine was appointed to supply his place, and my father loved to be pressed to drink. As my uncle and the priest quitted the room, I thought they appeared to pause before the picture of a young and beautiful female, which was over the chimneypiece; I thought I saw my uncle's eye glisten with something more than grief—' the priest crossed himself and his lips moved—neither of them spoke a word; when they were gone, I learnt a great part of the Chieftain's history from my father's sneers, and Deloraine's comments.

He was a son of a younger branch of





the old Milesian family of De Lacy; his father was indigent, and his prospect of succession was as remote as an host of intermediate heirs could make it; under these circumstances he determined to enter into foreign service—it was the custom of the day. During his preparations for this step, his maternal uncle, a man of large property, old and childless, offered him his estate on condition of his assuming the name of Bethel; the Milesian rejected the wealth and the condition with contempt; the offer was successively made to his three younger brothers, all but the youngest (my father) rejected it. The Chieftain went abroad with his brothers, to earn wealth and distinction by their swords; my father plunged into sudden affluence became the most luxurious and dissipated man of the age. The brothers met abroad, but the De Lacys would not own their relationship, and my father's pleasures were such as did not require the auxiliaries of domestic affection. When my uncle had seen his brothers perish in the service, in which he had wasted his youth and his blood without reward, he began to think that poverty would be more tolerable in a country he loved, than abroad. He determined to spend the remainder of his life under the shadow of the walls of his kindred's castle, which he was always accustomed to call, the house of his fathers.





Perhaps his resolution received force from a cause of all others most likely to give force to habits of strenuous melancholy. He was said to be desperately attached to a French lady of distinguished rank and beauty, who loved him, and had owned her love, but felt his poverty was an hopeless obstruction to their happiness. He found consolation in the society of a young benedictine, an Irishman, whose superior was confessor in the lady's family; this young man avowed to the Chieftain his passion for his mistress, with the simplicity, and the despair of religion. It was a sad and strange confidence; they loved to talk of unattainable happiness, and mutual misery excluded jealousy; this was interrupted by De Lacy's returning to Ireland, to poverty, and celibacy, and solitude. He had scaicely arrived, when he received intelligence that he had succeeded to the title of Chieftain, and the property of his family, by the unexpected death of the late possessor, who had no legitimate children. Burning to visit the house of his fathers, now his own, the Chieftain however immediately embarked for France, and proceeded to claim the hand of the lady, whom he might now invite to a participation of wealth equal to her own. He arrived in hope and fear, such as the excess of love sometimes causes; he came to hear that the lady had retired to a convent, and shed her last tears on disappointed Ioyc a few





days before his arrival. I know not whether this misery was mitigated, or heightened,by the approaching dissolution of the nun: with sensibility uncommon in a French-woman, she sunk under her love and grief; she admitted her despairing lover to the grate, spoke as calmly as she could of resignation, and hopes that pointed to happiness, more pure and permanent, and when he tore himself from her sight, retired to die.

I heard nothing of the Chieftain's despair; by all accounts it was not very clamorous: he procured the lady's picture, procured the liberation of the young benedictine (whom lie appointed his confessor) from his convent, and returned to Ireland, where he resided in gloomy indolence and solitary grandeur. The improvements which in an happier frame, he had purposed to make in his own modes of life, and in those of his tenantry and dependants, were forgotten or deferred till they were forgotten. He was said sometimes to sooth his grief by speaking to his confessor of the object of their disastrous love, but this could only be conjectured, for her name was never heard to pass his lips.





He was often reproached with neglecting the great advantages by which he was distinguished, and perhaps he sometimes reproached himself for it; but we are accustomed to contrive some palliation for habitual failings, and the Chieftain compounded between the shame of his indolence and his respect for the habits of his ancestors. Whatever was noticed in the circumstances around him as defective, or requiring alteration, his frequent answer was, "It is the custom of my fathers."

I extorted this narrative by repeated questions ; those who informed me wondered at the emotion I expressed. I know not whether those who read it will feel with me or them. As it was concluded, the Chieftain and his co'fessor returned. Their faces had a glow such as human henevolence or pleasure never yet gave: the Chief's step was firmer, and his voice, without being elevated, had a rich and solemn depth of sound, as if he had just descended from high conference. He had been in prayer; the prayer of a broken and contrite heart, and a portion of its soft and solemn spirit rested on him still. I looked on this distinguished old man with increased love and awe every moment; I could not for my soul practise Deloraine's plan of contradiction.





There was enough without any effort from me: my father, provoked at being summoned to coffee too soon, peevishly dwelt on every subject of provocation. He talked of the dilapidated state of the castle. "It will last long enough to shelter the last of the De Lacys," said the Chieftain; "it may crumble over my grave without injuring me." My father spoke of the neglected appearance of the grounds about the castle, and the impolicy of indulging the tenants among whom he lived with such low rents; "a practice/' said he, "of which the mischief is obvious; for those who have little to pay, find the temptation to indolence so strong, that they neglect their farms and their landlords equally, while your tenants in the south, who hold much worse ground at an higher rent, pay that rent punctually, because they are excited to diligence by the pressure." "Let my successor raise his rents," said the Chieftain. "I will not change the customs of my fathers." My father would not be evaded; he renewed a subject of perpetual hostility, the modernness of Irish structures, the general want of marks of antiquity in the nation, and all its features. My uncle was roused, he rose, and grasping his mantle, burst forth into a flood of





declamation that silenced the " puny battle," of his assailant in a moment. It was full of strong and peculiar phrases, many of them harsh to an English ear, and foreign to the idiom of the language; he was evidently thinking in Irish, though he spoke in English. He concluded by saying, "Is it for those who have desolated the country, and razed every mark of power or of resistance from the face of it, to demand where is the proof of power, or of resistance, and after beating down with the savageness of conquerors, the monuments of our strength and greatness, to ask with the insolence of conquerors, what monuments of strength and greatness are left to us?"

"How is it then," said my father, when he recovered his breath, " that the Romans can still shew monuments of former greatness, surviving amid a country that was desolated by Goths." "Because the monuments of recent

VOL. I. K





greatness are more easily preserved than those of remote; the structures of Irish greatness were perhaps falling into ruins before those of Roman were erected. The great enemy to the" existence of our ancient monuments was Christianity; St. Patrick and his followers demolished

the heathen temples, and but I beg

your pardon Lionel (for he never would call him Bethel) I speak only to Irishmen. I desire to make no converts. I cannot argue with English minds. But he who shakes my belief in the antiquity of my country, must first shake my belief in the beatitude of the-immaculate Virgin Mary." We returned home, and two barefooted boys ran beside the carriage to prevent the coachman driving us into the dykes of the deep bog-road; for my uncle, though strictly temperate himself, laid no restraint on his household, in the savage custom of intoxicating the servants of their visitors.





My father read an extraordinary paragraph from an English morning paper, the following day:

"The distinguished family, who have so long possessed the title and estates of Westhampton, (in consequence of a late remarkable investigation, before the House of Lords) are about to resign them to the legitimate possessor, who has for many years struggled in oppression and obscurity.

"The noble family, on this diminution of their property and their honors, are about to retire to Ireland, in which country they have still a large estate. We are authorized to contradict in the most positive manner, that the lady of the noble lord in question has accepted any overtures to an arrangement from any party, of which the event would be to fix her residence in London. On the contrary she has announced her intention of accompanying her lord to Ireland





We condole with the fashionable world, on the total eclipse of its most brilliant luminarv," &c. &c. There was a vast deal more which my father in his joy had not patience to read.

"Thank heaven/' said he, " I shall have some society in this savage place. Lord Westhampton, or whatever he is now, gives the best dinners in the world. I knew him and Lady W. intimately abroad. They are the most charming people in the world. But they are cursedly mistaken if they imagine Lady W. will bury herself in Ireland, unless she has lost her beauty, and then she could not do a better thing, except shooting herself. But she is too exquisite a mistress of the art of beauty to lose it by age. She was the finest creature I ever beheld, two and twenty years ago, when we met at Naples. The design wag English, but the colouring and manner, aud finish, perfectly foreign.





"The worst of Lady W. was an incessant and unmitigated blaze of attractions that gave no mercy qr respite. She was for ever on the full stretch, and kept all her listeners and beholders so. She would beat every one on their own ground. In Paris she was the first coquet; in Italy the first cognoscenti"; in London the first politician in the female world. She was always in opposition, and gave a devilish deal of trouble to the 'ministry, till she succeeded in marrying one of her daugh* ters to the premier Lord Castle Wycomb, and then she was satisfied. But with all her wit and beauty and grandeur, (and I am told they are improving every year since'I knew her) she always appeared to me to be unhappy. There was always a kind of force and feverish irritation in her display of talents and attractions. Her manners had always something glaring and artificial like her rouge and fard. What the devil could make her unhappy, I never could imagine, for she had more vanity and admiration, than three-fourths of her sex beside."





The character struck me, carelessly and coarsely as it was sketched; there was something in it, at which my imagination kindled. "Perhaps," said I, "she might have desired something more than the pleasures of vanity and admiration; perhaps she was not happy in her family."

"I imagine," said he, "she was as happy as a woman of rank could expect. She had an immense family, about whom she managed so well, that the sons are all in very brilliant lines, and the daughters got off so young, that there could be no competition between them. None of them, that I heard of, indeed could contend with her; they were mere fashionable expletives; but she continued to find places for them famously. As to Lord W. he never could have given her the least disturbance. I don't think I





ever saw them together for three years I was abroad with them. If they travel to the family mansion in the family coach, it will probably be the first hour they have passed together since their marriage."

I was looking over the paragraphs while he was speaking; they occupied a whole column with conjectures, whether the furniture was to be sold or removed to Ireland, and whether the lady's diamonds were to pay the family debts, or the- gaming debts; and whether the jointure was to be given up, or the eldest son's splendid allowance diminished: and whether his lordship's magnificent set of plate, with the herald's coat and family crest and supporters, and foliage, &c. &c. was to be sent back to the jewellers; or her ladyship's last new barouche, elegantly finished, in the first style, by the first artist—the painting and varnish by —, the mouldings by —; the





border picked in with the livery colours, and the harness embellished after a new Parisian pattern, was to be sent to the coach-makers in place of his bill, &c. &c. &c. All this, with a thousand comments and conjectures, and regrets and flourishes, and hints at the iniquitous .share Lord W. had taken in a late transaction, and compassion for the lady whom the public voice universally acquitted; all this proved, that few subjects had so much occupied the fashion

*

able world, nay, even the public, feelings and curiosity, as this extraordinary affair. I observed to my father, that the papers were sufficiently liberal of their censures on Lord W. for his usurpation of the honors that had been wrested from him. They appeared to hint too, that his treatment of the person whom he has contrived to exclude from his possessions so long, had been eminently cruel and treacherous. He was silent.





I ventured to add, that the society of a man of such principles could hardly be regarded as an acquisition. "Principles," said my father, "what the devil have I to do with the principles of a man who gives such dinners as Lord W.? I wish half the nobility had such principles—of taste—But what day is this?" said he, looking at the date of his papers. "Morbleu, Sunday—Masseau, give me double my dose of laudanum. Miss Percival, I shall take it a favor if you will read t6 me to-day." Miss P., animated by the hope of conversion, began with "Godwin's Political Justice," and in a few minutes was accompanied by the loud snoring of her catechumen, on whom her reading had produced its full effect.

I stole out of the room to inquire for a place of worship in the neighbourhood. I was directed to a Romish chapel. I asked was there no church—tho church was in ruins; but one of the servants said he helicved that service was performed in the hall of Lord Roschamp's house, during his lordship's absence, as the housekeeper happened to be a Protestant. I rode there. Deloraine had shewed me the direction in which the house lay. A servant followed me with a request from my father, (who had awoke) to bring home to dinner any one I could meet with.





I have no desire to represent myself as—" righteous over much;" and a youth of sixtceri, going on a pilgrimage in quest of a church, may savour too much of spiritual errantry. But I had a strong sense of religion. My belief in revelation was firm, it has always been firm; and revelation points out the necessity of combining habits with feeling; and the expediency of public and prescriptive exercises of devotion too strongly to be mistaken, except by those who wish to mistake it.





"1 will not deny that the force of these feelings was increased by the force of opposition; and that my piety was never so prompt, when it was the habit of the family with whom I lived to. frequent church three times a day.

At a little distance from RoschampHouse, I saw a young man riding eagerly in the same direction; it was Hammond, the friend of my childhood, the man whom, even in childhood, I had fixed on as the friend of mature life. Our joy at meeting was equal; it was not diminished by the occasion of it. We were both going to the same place. We were the only members of our families who went there. Hammond was altered in nothing but his appearance. He was the same steadv, sedate character, of inflexible mind, and strenuous virtue. His character was so exactly the reverse of my own, that he was the very man of ten thousand who should have teen my friend. He went to church early, that he might request the clergyman to attend a sick servant at Hammond's-Grave. "She is surrounded," said he, f by Catholics, who are tormenting her to send for a priest; and if I did not execute this commission myself, I know no one in the house to whom it could he entrusted."





We entered the hall, which was filled with all the Protestant population in the neighbourhood, about forty persons. I knew how service was usually performed in country churches; the rector of the parish was absent, and I expected from the curate, what may be expected from a man who amid obscurity and indigence has sullied and lost whatever he possessed in early life of the habits of a gentleman and a scholar. The service was performed by a man who gave me new ideas of religion and its ministers for ever. Let me indulge in speaking a few words

3





of this man, whose agency in my narrative may justify the digression.

His name was Corbett. He had been a curate six and forty years. He sought not to be any thing else. The religion he possessed had taught him, "having food and raiment, to be therewith content;" and the same influence extending to his habits, had enabled him by temperance and prudence, to obtain all he thought necessary in life. He was married, and had a son whom he himself had educated; and who, like himself, was in the ministry. When I speak of the effects of his mode of prayers and preaching, I speak of the effects I witnessed in the course of a constant attendance on him. He never read prayers; he prayed,- and with such deep and fervent feeling, with emphasis so obviously suggested, not by the art, but by the nature of supplication; with pauses so strongly marked by solemnity of recollection, and a suspension of the act, without a suspension





of the feeling, that his congregation almost unconsciously joined in the responses, which were originally intended for their utterance, and felt the force of habit and of indolence yield to the holy energy with which he poured out his petitions.

I never heard man preach as he did. He was a scholar, to whom few I have ever met were superior. He was a man delighting in conversation, in which, if light, he could amuse, and if argumentative, he could instruct, more than any man I ever listened to. But in the pulpit, he laid aside the wisdom of words, and the weapons of fleshly warfare altogether. That he was a scholar you felt not; you felt not that-he was a man of rich imagination, or of strong reasoning powers-? you felt not that he or his discourse could be referred to any class of mind or composition that could assist you to judge of them in a temporal sense. But you felt irresistibly that he





was a believer, pleading with the power of conviction; that he was a religionist, speaking from experience, commending a life he lived, and a felicity he felt; that lie spoke and acted on principles which, though beyond the range of existence, were not beyond the range of reality; principles, which he made present and vivid, and substantial alike by the force of eloquence, and the force of example. He was a speaker, who, of all others I ever heard, succeeded most in averting your attention from himself to his subject. It was long after his sermons had concluded, that you could think of the preacher, like the priest in the Jewish hierarchy—he disappeared in the cloud of incense himself sent up.

The Christianity he preached, was such as a man would preach, who, abstracted from the influence of prejudice and habit and self-wisdom, had sought his system in revelation alone, and found and





formed it there. It was neither a frame of doctrinal niceties, curiously constructed, and totally unfit for use; nor a formulary of habitual observances, at which the constant attendance of the body may excuse the absence of the mind. It was a system, of which the principles were operative, in which opinion held its due relation to practice; Christianity was described as a dispensation exhibiting certain facts to the belief; and the belief, if subdued by these facts, suggesting the most important and active consequences to our minds and our lives. # It may be thought there was something in this mode of representation too argumentative and consequential for the comprehension of a rustic audience—it was not so.. Though Jus positions were strong and important, they were clothed in a language, whose peculiar and providential felicity is, that it is the universal language, the first language that religioa talks to the ear of infancy, the language that genius reverences, and ignorance understands, the language of the poet and of the saint, the language of divinity and of the heart, the language of the Scriptures.





He spoke as a father pleading with a wayward child; he spoke as a judge with a criminal, to confess and be forgiven; as a guide with a wanderer, to return and to rest.

When he finished his sermon, it was not with Cowper's "well-bred whisper." He appeared for some time engaged in prayer; an effusion of mind so solemn and deep, that most of the audience involuntarily joined in it; those who did not, were awed and silent. When he came down, and walked among us, though the thunder of his eloquence was hushed, his countenance spoke still. He had descended from the mount; but his visage retained the brightness of that high place. If I write of this man, I shall write volumes. When I could approach him, I introduced myself to him, solicited his acquaintance, and praised his-discourse in those broken and tremulous sentences, which are all that wonder and reverence leave us breath for.





He put by my praises with a courteous humility, that declined the common traffic of commendation for vanity. I know not whether it will not sound like an interruption of this "celestial colloquy," that Mr. Corbett promised to dine at Lemon-Grove, and that I compelled him to accept my horse, as he acknowledged the distance was remote for a man of his age on foot.

I walked slowly homewards, and tried to believe it was to revolve Mr. Corbett's sermon; but every thought presented Lady Montrevor—her situation so romantic, her beauty so resplendent, buried in a wild country, and so near me. I calculated the very way her carriage would come, and gazed as if I expected to see it there. That she would come I was determined to believe, in spite of my father's sneers; for, her beauty and her errors, her splendour and her melancholy, the mixed and cloudy brightness of her character was but too delightful to an imagination like mine. I was delighted at meeting almost every moment cars and waggons, and every implement for carrying furniture, and a train of splashed and weary servants cursing the bog-roads in French and English; all indications of the progress of the great family, on the road to Montrevor-House. I loitered looking at them till it was late, and the heavy clouds of evening were deepened by a storm. I looked about me, I had mistaken the road; I saw no one near to direct me, but a dark figure that was moving rapidly at a distance. I hastened to him;





his appearance made me almost repent my haste. He was wrapt in a dark cloak; he had a cap on his head of a strong and ancient fashion; his face was as pale as that of a corse, and two dark eyes, which though fixed on me, did not seem to see me, gave an expression to his face, that was almost supernatural. I addressed him in English, and inquired my way to Lemon-Grove. He was silent. I repeated my question in French, for there was something foreign in his air. He pointed to the left, and hastily pursued another direction. Before I had proceeded far. the violence of the rain made me look round for shelter.

I saw nothing near me but the building which Deloraine had pointed out to me, as the haunted house; it was a single solitary tower at the extremity of a bridge I was crossing. With some difficulty I obtained admission, for the inhabitant was an old woman who only spoke Irish; its appearance within was as melancholy as without; it seemed to have been uninhabited for many years, and then imperfectly repaired for the admission of the inhabitant. As I looked about me, not without some mixture of uneasiness, I saw the dark figure approaching, he entered. He started on seeing me, but did not speak, and darting up a winding flight of stone steps in an angle of the tower disappeared. I conceived at once this was the person whom Deloraine had described—the strange inhabitant of this strange mansion. The old woman went out for some turf to replenish the wretched fire. I was not easy in my situation, yet I was unwilling to go, for my curiosity was strongly excited.





The feeling was not unmingled with fear, as a strange sound, low, but distinct, issued from the direction in which the stranger had disappeared. I listened intently; it was a groan, deep and prolonged, it was scarce louder than respiration, it was no clamour of common grief, it was the inward cry of a wounded spirit. My breath grew short as I listened, it continued without intermission, but while I still wondered, my wonder was changed into horror: my hands and neck were stained with drops of blood, fresh and warm, that fell slowly on them through the broken roof. I could remain no longer, I rushed out. There was no attempt made to detain me.





When I reached my father's, the sight of a large and cheerful circle (for when my father wished to excite cheerfulness, none could resist him) almost banished the visionary complexion of my thoughts: but I mentioned the circumstances that had detained me. Mr. Corbett said that he believed the person I had met to he indeed a mysterious character, but it was a mystery which had nothing to alarm, it 'only referred' to himself; he was of the Catholic persuasion, he lived in utter solitude, he knew no one, and no one even knew his name: but he was eminently charitable, and in their mutual visits to the poor, they had often met, but never exchanged a sellable. Of a man whose habits were so exemplary, he would not willingly believe the guilt, but he believed him to have been unfortunate, perhaps to the partial derangement of his reason. I had almost trembled for the reception Mr. C. might meet at Lemon-grove, but I found my father disarmed by the simplicity of his manners, that neither sought to declaim nor to dictate, and amused by the variety and intelligence of his conversation. Hammond too appeared more than amused by Sybilla, and I was suffered to think of Lady M. without interruption.





In the morning there came- an old gardener from Montrevor House in despair. When he could understand the directions given by the new servants who were coming down in scores, for arranging the furniture, &c. &c. &c. he found that the hall and staircase, and gallery, were to he filled with flowers, " which the Blessed Virgin help me," said the old man, "I thought were to grow in gardens; so I had packed them all with flowers as tight as a kish of turf, and the whole house looked as green as the top of. my cabbin, when behold you, an unlucky gossoon of a boy knocked a great orange tree, that stood up by the great staircase window, as tall and as straight as your young master, and murdered it all to pieces, and murdered me too, for as my soul shall go to glory, I have not the fellow of it in the world; and there is the companion of it standing upon the other side as serious and as dismal as any Christian creature you ever saw in your life that had lost its friend and its gossip, and I moaning over them both, till I am almost killed." My





father, who heardhis moaning,determined to send one of his finest orange trees immediately to Montrevor House, and desired that the family should be acquainted on their arrival with the name of the donor, as he wished to renew his acquaintance with them under friendly auspices. The orange tree, in full produce, placed in a superb tub, was accordingly committed to the care of a servant, who en suite committed it to a carman to convey to Montrcver House. In a couple of hours the driver returned with visible marks of distress and contusions. The abridgment of his adventure was, that about a mile from Montrevor House, he had been overtaken by two persons on horseback, whom from their dress he conceived to be grooms, but who turned out to be gentlemen from the bets they made, and the •oaths they swore. As they , came up with him on a full canter, "Damme, Jack/' said the first, /' I'll Vol. i. fc





1



engage I'll nick the top orange of that tree with my whip as I pass it, without pulling in." "Done, damme, that you wo'nt for five guineas." The foremost then rode up, but only nicked the leaves. He then offered to double the bet, and do it if the car was stationary; this wag accepted, and the carman ordered to stop. He refused, a scuffle followed, till at length the gentleman, provoked at the fellow's mistaking him for a servant of Lord Montrevor's, and threatening to -tell his master of him, offered to box the rascal, for the car and orange tree and all. The man, confident of his strength, readily agreed, and a yery spirited set-to took place in the road, in which the carman had a decided advantage, till unluckily seeing his horse, who was tired of the fray, turning back with his load to Lemongrove, and quitting the engagement to overtake him, he was judged by the gentlemen to haye broken the rules, and for





€eited the prize, which they compelled him to lead to Roschamp House in trir umph, where he learnt with some confusion that his assailants were Lord \ Roschamp, and a sporting companion of his, Sir John Oiberry, who were come down to keep up a dust for about a week, among the savages of the west.

My father was outrageous at this insult, of -which the levity did not at all atone for the impertinence. I immediately sprung 'on horseback, and desiring a man to follow me to Roschamp House, with a car, I hurried there with resentment, little inferior to his. I was there in a few minutes, I inquired for Lord Roschamp, he was abroad. I hesitated a moment about the propriety of entering an house, in the absence of the master, till recollecting that he could easily find me at home, if he wished, I walked deliberately into the hall, and desiring the man who was with me to take the orange tree, and





replace it on his car, I waited till I saw him perform my directions without disturbance. As I was going out a slight figure in a riding dress entered the hall; his appearance was mean and diminutive. The man hesitated, I desired him to proceed, "Where are you going with that, my fine fellow?" said the figure. "I am going to my master's, or wherever my ma«ter pleases to bid me," said the man, emboldened by his master's presence. "Very fine, damme, very famous upon mv soul," said the baronet walking off. "That is Sir John," said the man. He showed no wish to speak to or detain me. and as 1 did not desire to assume the appearance of braving a man gratuitously, I walked out as deliberately as I had entered, and escorted the orange tree back to my fathers, for it was now too late to send it to its first destination.

We were todine that day at Hammond s, for my father had drowned his horrors of Irish neighbourhood in their elaret: but the day that he passed at Hammond's, he did notrecoverfor a week; it was a castle-rackrcnt, an house of disorder and riot, wheTe a bad dinner, vilely dressed, and attended by careless servants, was washed down by floods of wine, that were swallowed with the precipitation of men who were in haste to forget themselves. His mistress sat at the table,* some of his illegitimate children by his servants attended at it; the company were some vulgar and worthless wretches, who were permitted to live there to excite laughter, and to swallow wine. The conversation was such as not even young Hammond could give a colouring- of decency to, and the jests such as buiFoons, or schoolboys, would substitute for wit. When my father drew out his handkerchief, he found a lighted turf had been introduced into his pocket, and when he burst away from his * Taken frem real life.





tormentors, he was presented with fris pelisse in the lining of which a live mouse was inserted, and an hat on which a doghad enjoyed very good repose and digestion. I was> seriously incensed at this buffoonery practised on a man delicate from habit, and irritable from ill-health. I made him put on my coat, and heaping those of the servants about him to secure him from cold, I found I had excluded myself from any room in the carriage; I took an horse from one of the servants, and rode beside it.

It was night, and as we approached Montrevor House, a vast number of moving lights, and a tumult of carriages announced the arrival of the family. As we drew nearer, I could distinguish two carriages and a chariot by the lamps before them, and eight outriders. I thought of what one of those carriages might contain, and stopt my horse at a little distance frota the gates,





tfist I could see by torchlight were thrown open for their reception. The two first carriages had entered, and the coachman was manceuvering the four horses to follow with the third, when a sound, that I could compare to nothing human, suddenly arose from the other side of the road, and a number of persons, apparently intoxicated or frantic, surrounded the carriage with cries and gestures of madness. The spirited horses that drew it, reared and plunged with the utmost violence, scattering the crowd in all directions, the coachman was unable to manage them; the people who had terrified them, appeared terrified themselves, the carriage rolling backwards across the road, with its wheels on the very verge of an hill. The screams of females from within were audible: at this" moment I sprung from my horse, and grasping the reins of the foremost horse, gave him a lash with my whip across the neck, that impelled him to make a forcible spring forward, and saved them from their perilous situation. But by this time the confusion was general. One of the outriders who was armed, gallopped up, and seeing me hold the reins, presented a pistol at me; I called out to him to hold, but it was too late. I felt the bullet as I thought shatter my arm, I continued to grasp the reins, and call to the coachman that all was safe as long as I was able; but in a moment, from the effusion of blood, and the vehemence of my exertion, my strength failed, I fell and was carried insensible to my. father's carriage which had turned back^ori the tumult.





I was carried home, the wound which was examined by the surgeon of a regiment, quartered in Banagher, was merely a flesh-one; the ball had only grazed my arm, but the loss of blood was great, and my fever was high the next day. But my pain was soothed by the most courtly. messages from Montrevor House, which were brought three times a. day, during my confinement; accompanied the first by a note from his lordship full of regret, for my disaster, and praises of my courage, &c. &c. to which the Miss Montolieus, and their gouvernante, who were in the last carriage, probab ly owed their life, &c. &c.





How the disaster happened, I could not imagine till one of the principal causes of it came to Lemon-grove, to pour out his lamentations over me ; it was the old gardener, " and to be sure, honey," said he, ff if I had thought it was you that were to be killed in this manner, I wouldhave killed myself vjfith my own hands ten times over first.. But as- we were alt tenants to this great new lord, and old followers to the family, though they never lived among us, why we all loved' him as we did our eyes, though we never set them upou his face till last night. sSo we thought it would be but right tp> go out and give him a shout of joy, when he was coming to his own house, that he never was in before; and we all set out, and we were early enough to see him, for the devil a bit of him was there, and so says I to them, there's no good at all in waiting to see a man in the dark, and we are perished standing here in the bogr with nothing to warm us but the rain and wind; and so let us step into Paddy Donnellan's, that is within a step of the gate, and take a drop of whiskey, and when we hear the carriage wheeTr we'll all come out as fresh as daisies, and give him an Irish cry that he never heard from them English spalpVens in his Hfe; so we all went to Paddy Donnellan's, and by my soul when we walked out, there was not one of us able to stand, so we all tumbled into the ditch, and began murdering each other, and Paddy fell upon me, and knocked my life out, which was very »nkind of you Paddy, says I, when yoa





know that your aunt was- my mother's gossip, and when I took you out of the hands of your two brothers that were after murdering you last St. Michael's day at Banagher-fair. So while we were all scrambling in'the ditch for the honor and glory of the Montrevbrs, up came the carriages, and we all rolled out as bad as 'we could, and when we all began to shout, hell to the" soul of us that could open our mouths/ arid my lord's servants knocked down some of us, and the rest of ws knocked down ourselves, and I ran along by my lord's carriage to the gate,and the coachman killing me all the way. with the whip, and I begging pardon, and nobody to hear me, and still I ran an,. and got first to the-house, to look in my lord and my lady's faces, to see if they were angry ; and the first that came out I took for a young officer, for it Was all in scarlet, but this was my lady; the servarft took her out in his arms, and she looked





very pale all in the flambeau light, and I told her all about the whiskey and Paddy Donnellan, and begged her ladyship's pardon, and the blessed Virgin's, for it was her night, and then the servants pushed us away; and at last there came out a gentleman whom 1 took to be my lord, and he gave us a power of money in her ladyship's own sweet name, and then we gave her a shout m earnest, that would have brought her from the other world, if we had murdered her. But may I never die in sin, if when I heard of you, and of that blundering roguethat put a bullet into your arm, if I did not determine to go drown myself in the bog, and never come out of it again till 1 heard you were alive and well."

The first day I was permitted, I rode to Montrevor-House, to return thanks for their inquiries, and to place the orange-tree, which was brought with me, on the staii-case. I thought I had secured myself against disappointment by not going till two o'clock, but at that hour not one of the family had quitted their apartments, but Lady M.'s femme. On hearing my name, she desired the groom of the chambers to remove the orangetree to her lady's dressing-room, as her ladyship (who heard of it) desired it might be placed there. I care not who laughs at me, for . acknowledging that their notice elated me beyond measure, A fortnight was now passed in visiting; all the gentry of the neighbourhood crowded the avenues to MontrevorHouse with their carriages, as it was v universally understood, that Lord M. had retired merely to concert plans for liis return at leisure; that one of these -was to make himself of consequence, by getting his second son, Col. Montolieu, returned for the county; and for this purpose, he had determined to live in the most splendid hospitality, that he might ensure a good reception for his son, wEs> was then abroad' with an expedition.





The country was fair of reports, or rather conjectures, about thefamily; not one of the females had ever been visible since their arrival, and his lordship had been .seen but rarely r but he was pronounced the most charming man in the world-: all that a peer, and- a courtier, and a senator could be, by those who had had the good fortune to exchange a. bon-jour with him. I was._ glad that Lady M. had yet been seen by none; I would notwiHingly have listened to such a description, -as they who talked of her would have given. I should have heard of the pattern of'her travelling costume, or the lace of her morning dress: I did not wish the dreams which I indulged of her,'to be disturbed by vulgar description. Among other visitors, my father went, and we had the satisfaction of hearing that our equipage and suite 3





'were less laughed at by his- lordship's servants, than any that had yet approached his gates. The visit was soon followed by an invitation from Lord M., in which we understand half the country was included. My father, who was a strict observer of etiquette, was at first displeased that the invitation should- first come from the stranger} but he pacified himself by reflecting, that his lordship's superior rank justified him in conferring the first compliment, and he resolved to go.

I will not interrupt this narrative with any reflexions on myself; I will not talk of the precipice on which I was treading ;. I will merely describe what I saw, and leave what I felt to be imagined.

I know riot whether the detail of these things be interesting, yet if any one can fill his imagination with the idea of a magnificent family struck from their sphere, and rushing like a comet into lemoteness and obscurity, but attended





by a train of splendour that marks their progress,- and dignifies their departure; if he can fill his imagination with this, he* will not wonder at the tumultuous and romantic admiration of a boy, to whom every thing was as delightful from its novelty as its splendour.

We arrived at M—i- House at a late hour; it presented in every room the appearance of an house deserted for years, and then hastily filled with every thing that luxury could accumulate, without time to- arrange; The hall was filled with shrubs and flowers-, ojT which some in default of their china vases which had been broke on the way, were obliged to- take up with the' turf-tubs, which were all the Irish ser» vants had to offer for their accommodation. On the staircase, colossal bronze figures extended their hands for lamps which they did not hold,- and a splendid tripod was placed in the window for want





of a chain,'though a compartment in the eieling had been opened for its reception. The rich carpeting intended for other stairs, was eked out on the corridor by an hearth-rug of the same pattern; the rooms themselves divested of their ancient damask hangings, presented a chilling nakedness of wall, in spite of the splendid specimens of Egyptian costume that were spread on an uncovered couch in the drawing-room fox inspection. Candelabra without stands, and stands without candelabra; gold fish in a vase over which my father was near falling at his entrance, as their station was occupied by a new-arrived cabinet of Egyptian antiquities in granite; and a range of exotics blowing in water placed in the window-seats, as the vessels that held them were too large for the Irish chimney piece; shades of painted muslin in imitation of gothic casements, placed beside windows which were too large;: and couches and curtains divested of thciV canopies, whose gorgeous and gilded cornices were some feet higher than the cieling, but which were displayed in a; kind of regular and ostentatious confusion: such was the costume of M— House. , The room was full of company, who looked around them and on each other with sufficient surprize, there was nothing else t© occupy them. Neither Lord nor Lady M. had appeared. At the upper end of the room, almost hid among the clusters of Persian roses, Rat two female figures; one of them was evidently a French woman, and as I judged (rightly ) the gouvernante; the other I judged, from a certain air of distinction, to be Miss Montolieu.





Her form- was of the most delicate and £iiry texture,- her complexion was almost as white as her drapery, it was the paleness of that peculiar state of health, which seems affected by the irritation of ihe mind: there was something fantastic almost to> excess in her gestures, yet they were irresistibly graceful. She appeared hardly fifteen; yet the expression, that sometimes wandered over her features, spoke a mind and feelings that had outgone the progressj of her frame, as a mind of early, and exquisite, and dangerous maturity: her white neck and arms were entirely uncovered r her fair hair, entirely withdrawn from her face, was twisted in a tuft on the crown of the head; a book was in her handr which she laid down every moment to reconnoitre the groupes that entered through her glass, and whisper the gouvernante in French, whose glaring dress and officious loudness, contrasted most forcibly the simple dress, and reserve, and languid articulation of her companion.





I suppose I gazed intently on Miss Montolieu; perhaps, too, the glow of admiration had lit up my face, for Madame la Gouvernante pointing to a passage in hfr book, ( Belinda) for she too was readings said audibly, "11 y'a infiniment l'air d'un heros de Roman." I bLushed, yet I did not wish to appear ignorant of French, or of the allusion, and turning to my father, I said, (I do not remember with what truth) "Apparemment c'est un grand orage." Miss M. withdrew her eyes, but Madame laughed with genuine French facilite.





A splendid time-piece, which had once sparkled on a mantle-piece in the Louvre, had pointed its enamelled hand to seven, when the profuse bows of every one near the door announced the entrance of Lord Montrevor. He paused at the door to receive. his handkerchief from his Frenchman, who was drenching it with attar of rose, and then drawing up his cravat, and drawing down his shirt-sleeves by their diamond buttons, to intimate the haste he made to accommodate his Irish friends; he Advanced into the circle, dispersing timidity by bows, of which nothingcould exceed the gracious humility; and conciliating kindness by an address, of which nothing could resist the allurement.





He made the complete tour, saying the same nothings to every one, yet contriving 4o make them appear different and consequential to each; and bowed with the same grace and gravity to his daughter -and her governess, as to any stranger present. Of my father, whom he recollected, or affected to recollect, he took the most flattering notice; and of me, in consequence of his introduction. There was no boy of seventeen ardent and inexperienced as I was, but must have been subdued by his address 7 I thought him the most polished man in the world; and I was convinced in a moment, he had been greatly misrepresented in the circumstances that were related of him.

The groom of the chambers had twice been desired to summon his lady in vain j dinner was at length announced, and we paraded into the immense salle a manger, where every thing announced the struggle between sudden magnificence and long neglect and desolation. The immense sideboard, of which the mahogany block legs might have supported the arches of a bridge, and the brass might have cloathed the cannon of a battery, eould be brought no further than the hall from the narrowness of the doors; there therefore it rested in surly state like a deposed monarch, and a display of plate, which for its magnitude might have accompanied the sacrifice of an hetacomb, was displayed on a series of small tables at one extremity of the room, the other was occupied by a large family piece, representing Lady M. and some of her daughters in the costume of nymphs, sacrificing to the garden god from a drawing of Angelica Kauffmann's. This painting it 5Y#8 proposed, by a. new artist of cos





4umes to surround with drapery instead of «k frame, in order to make the pyramidal principle in the groupe more obvious: at present, however, destitute of •either frame or drapery, it served to stand before one of the chimney pieces, which not being like the other of verde antique, his lordship's pure eyes could not bear to behold; while the company commended his taste with chattering teeth, as one fire in a room of vast dimensions paved with marble, reconciled them very imperfectly to the virtu that had 'comfort at one entrance quite shut out.' No light was tolerated but what was dispensed by lamps or tripods; the.dinner table therefore was placed under antique vases, which, suspended from the centre of the cieling, nearly two feet distant from the summit of the epergne, shed over the table no light but 'darkness visible,' and added to the confusion with which the company beheld, an heap ,of -dishes of form and composition utterly unknown to them, whose names the French servants repeated with seriousness and surprise, that made a jest of famine wad perplexity.





Here, however, my father was perfectly at home. The arrangement of the tahle was somewhat singular: his lordship sat at the head of the table, near him a seat was reserved apparently for his lady. Miss Montolieu took place of the numerous female visitors who were present, and his lordship's agent (to the no small displeasure of the company) was seated at the foot, his lordship declaring that he would entrust the carving of the fish which was placed there after the soups, to no one but Mr. Griffin, who was obliged to request one of the footmen to supply him with a temporary light from the side-tables, whenever he was called on in bis carving capacity. Dinner was to *ne more a matter of curiosity than indulgence, I looked more at Lord Montrevor, than at his plate or his table. His figure -was the most noble and majestic I ever beheld, had he not degraded it by.the levity of dress in the extreme of modern fashion. The glossy curls that shaded his face steamed with essence, his complexion was evidently heightened by art, and every part of his dress, to which an ornament could be appended, blazed with diamonds. His manner was irresistible, blending the extremes of stateliness and suavity; he made every one feel his superiority, yet acquiesce in it, and enjoy his condescension though it marked the excess of his pride.





Almost the whole of his conversation waj addressed in French to the servant behind his chair, till finding, or conceiving, that an unknown language could impress _his hearers with but confused notions of his grandeur, he condescended to speak English, but this was only that lie

VOL. I. M





might repeat the half-English, half-classical, half-foreign names of the dishes, and wines, and furniture; the amphoree, and vases, and urns, that were always specified as being on that marble table, or that bronze pedestal, of which the multitude and antique forms combining with the darkness, made us resemble a groupe dining amid the ruins of an Herculanean theatre.

The first course had disappeared, and the enormous plateau of silver that covered the centre of the table, was removed to make room for the lighter embellishments of the second, when the door was thrown unusually wide, and a kind of silent tumult among the servants announced the entrance of Lady Montrevor. The company rose v ith a common expression of wonder, independent of the example of his lordship and Miss Montolieu. I know not how to speak at this moment; I wish I could borrow the com





mon language of description, and tell as I would of any woman of fashion on her first appearance, how she glided along the room with a motion that appeared intended for air not earth, one hand grasping her drapery, the other extended in an attitude that made the command it conveyed "not to rise," impossible to obey. She approached the head of the table, which every one wished at a distance, that they might see her move to it again; she was then nearly opposite to me, I had a full, fatal view of her.

Whether in sport, or in negligence, she was in a morning dress, whose long sleeves covered her hands, and whose collar rose to her ears, a train of a length which only- she cOuld manage, flowed behind her almost to the door, and an enormous lace veil almost shutting out her profile; yet from its fineness, permitting the light curls on the cheek to be seei* through it, fell equally from her head,





and extended to the ground. Her form was that of a Grecian priestess, or of the deity, at whose shrine a Grecian priestess might stand. She looked round her, something like a smile of triumph or of sportiveness was on her features; our awkward wonder, our audible murmur, must have amused her. She was determined to allow us no respite. "No stirring—I beg, I intreat, or whatever else I ought to do." The first tones of her voice, were like music to the first ears that heard it.

She turned round, "What—a chair reserved for me—this is quite the banquet scene in Macbeth. If I sit in that chair, I shall absolutely imagine myself the ghost of Banquo, or his wife; who is probably a ghost also by this time." The servant attempted to remove the chair. "No, it will do if you remove that enormous woolsack cushion; there i3 too much sensual accommodation in it, pour





tnr habitant spirituelle." "Shall I have the pleasure of helping you to some pheasant, Lady Montrevor?" "Was it you, my Lord, that made my empty chair be placed near you, to reconcile yourself to its contemplation?" "La Jeunesse, apportez les fricandeaux, il me semble que Madame" "La Jeunesse, make haste and get me some soup, if the noble lord on the woolsack has finished his speech." Lord Montrevor had just called for the discarded cushion, or rather mattrass of morocco leather; it was impossible for man to speak with more stately courtesy than his lordship, or. for woman to answer with more airy contempt than his lady.

How I heard these few words I cannot imagine. I remember them only because they were her's, for I wished to be all eye. I was all eye; and the partial and shuded glimpse of features which gleamed through the folds of her veil, like the moon through a silken, summer-evening cloud, fed me with thoughts of iina ginable beauty.





I can speak of her at no time, fo; every time I saw her she was different; it is difficult to speak of her mode of beauty, it is more difficult to speak of her age. She was so matchless a mistress of the art of beauty, and dress, and cosmetics, that she delighted to modify the costume of her face and form, and time, which is* more stubborn than. 'either. I have seen her when with a few arbutus berries or convolvuli twisted among her flaxen ringlets, with scarce a trace of rouge on her cheeks, but her red half-open lip warm with a tinge, like a melted ruby;- her robe scarce touching the ground, and no ornament on her white bosom but one curl; she appeared hardly eighteen, if age could be attached to the style of nymph-like and aeriel beauty she had chosen—and I have seen j her when amid a blaze of rouge and dia





monds, the folds of her dark and shining hair, surmounted by a sparkling tiara, and her train strewing the floor with roses, she appeared the sultaness of the seraglio, the queen of fairy-land, the presiding genius of splendour and voluptuousness, high and sparkling as a star, and o'er-informing her sphere with light and lustre; such as she was that day, her beauty was that of a Madoua, and her age seemed hardly that which is usually ascribed to the character. Her rouge had given place to pearl-powder, and her proud smile and haughty consciousness which she usually poured on strangers, were exchanged for a retiring grace, a soft suppression of charms, a partial and unoppressive glance of observation, which I could wish to have continued for ever; I could at least have been content to gaze on them for ever, but I was doomed to be the hero of the day.

Some one mentioned my name





Lady M. immediately applied her glassr and inquired was I the gentleman to whom Miss M. owed her safety? she was answered in the affirmative, and I was assailed with a torrent of inquiries, and condolences, and commendations; which I would have silenced at any price, to have caught the sound of the only praise my ear thirsted for, but which the general clamour effectually drowned. This was not all; after the first tumult, Lady M. said to the servant in French, "I hope, La Jeunesse, you asked Mr. B.'s pardon for your unfortunate mistake." La Jeunesse, with all the glaring manner of a Frenchman, immediately advanced, and throwing himself on his knees, supplicated my pardon with the most pompoHS humility. I would rather a thousand times have stood a second shot from him; I felt the blood literally mounting to the roots of my hair. Lady M. saw or felt it, she called off La Jeunesse, but before





Be had finished his speech, a new scene relieved me from observation.

With the same tumult,.and the same dress,, •with which they would enter astable, Lord Roschamp and his friend plunged into the room, and rushing up to Lord and JLady M , accosted them in tones that made the roof echo. "Why what the devil—what hours are those you keep? the fellows in the hall tell mc you have been an hour at it, and it is scarce half past eight o'clock." "I always dine at the hour mentioned in my card; had not your lordship a card?" "I believe my fellow told me so; but how the devil," said he, displacing two or three persons,, and seating himself beside Lady Montrevor, "does your Ladyship contrive to exist in this infernal country,?" Her ladyship who had not yet opened, her lips, now fixing her eyes upon him, demanded with extreme earnestness where his dog was ?" My dog—my dog," said; the peer in surprize. "Yes, your dog, I am sure he was included in the invitation, I can't be positive that his name v as not mentioned first; nothing but the expectation of meeting him could have dragged me down to-day."





Lord Roschamp sprung up in a moment, and rushed into the hall; ". Here, Martin, my famous fellow, mount this moment again, and gallop back to Roschamp-House most amazingly, tell Masters to take off Cassar's collar, and bring him here without slipping your foot out of the stirrup, my capital one." Just as the order was given, Caesar, who had followed his master unobserved, bounded into the room, covered with mud of a five-miles march, and sprung upon Lady M. who received him with a scream of joy. "Oh! you beautiful—beautiful creature, kiss me, or tear my veil to fragments if you will. Sit down, my lord, since your dog k





stated, and let me tell you of his merits; nothing ever was so wonderful as my regard for this brute, except the cause of it. You know the Rees, my lord, she will be a fashionable in spite of us and herself; last winter she determined to be, or be thought musical, and actually fainted in form in her box, at a bass solo hi an overture. The next day she received a poetical address on her sensibility, which she said was written by the performer who had excited it, and who:.i she rewarded with a splendid douceur. I was convinced the whole was a trick to sig-nalize each other, and when the verses (which were execrable) were handed to me one night, I sketched in the margin a figure of the Rces, in the costume of Mahomet, entranced, and the artist picking peas out of her ear. It took immensely, and when the Rees sent to mc for her verses, (as I literally believe they were) I was afraid to return them, and





told a thousand lies about it. One day as I was in the Green-Park, I took it out to show to Lord Castle-Wycomb; at that moment the Rees came up. In my confusion I dropt it; and in my confusion would have died, had not the charming animal sprung from his master, seized it at the very moment she was stooping for it, and tore the Rees's reputation to atoms in a moment.

Sir John and the peer remembered the -whole story in a moment. "Damme, it was a most famous hoax; and how confoundedly blank the Rees looked, when you told her you were just going to return it, and lamented the ctourderies of Caesar." The dog was loaded with praises; and after being crowned with flowers taken from the dessert, and tearing . Lady M.'s veil in resistance of his new honors, was led out of the room. Lord M. still importuning his lady to make «ome dinner; and her ladyship heedlessly





tracing the foliage on her silver plate with her fork, and only answering with contretemps praises of Caesar. ** He is the most amazingly famous dog in the world," said Lord Roschamp; "by my soul, I don't wonder at a Grecian nobleman having made a consul of his dog." His ignorance was too gross- not to be exposed; and I was actually distracted at Lady M.'s attention to him and his dog. "I observed that history had intimated the dog was an horse."—" A bull, a bull," roared Lord Roschamp; "heh my lord, eh Sir John."—" A most famous bull upon my soul," echoed Sir John.—I was incensed at his overbearing ignorance, and began to explain with too much earnestness; perhaps Lady M. thought so, or perhaps I only flattered myself that she thought so; but rising suddenly, and half turning to the female part of the company, she said, "Shall we make our escape before we are baited by an English dog and an Irish bull."





The ladies retired. The conversation became more general. Lord Roschampand his friend observed me with a kind of contemptuous jealousy. I felt irritated, and proud, and watchful, like a boyfirst animated by female excellence, and conscious or desirous of something equal to it in himself.

Lord Montrevor spoke exclusively of himself, his plans, and his circumstances. He alluded, with the utmost nonchalance, to the petite embarras that had made a retreat to Ireland for a short time expedient; but he spoke ef his splendid and exclusive connexions,, of his eldest son, the envoy &t a northern court, and his son-in-law, the first political character in Great Britain, and of the numerous arrangements already made for his return, and that he hesitated between accepting an appointment as ambassador at , or a place at court,

with a pension on the Irish establishment; but that he had always been in the habit of sacrificing his own feelings, and objects, to those of his family, whom he wished to indulge with an excursion to Ireland; and I can scarcely," he continued, "regret any circumstances that have placed me in the circle by whom! feel myself so happily surrounded at present—la Jeunesse, more Burgundy."





This speech, the latter part of it particularly, uttered with a grace, which not seen, cannot be described,- was irresistible to the audience. I retired amid the confusion of compliments and toasts; my whole soul was in the drawing-room,' card-tables were laid, and coffee distributed. Lady Montrevor, reclining on a canopied couch, was endeavouring to describe to a few stragglers the effects of the Turkish costume, in a boudoir, which she purposed finishing from some sketches, by Miss Montolieu, that lay on a table before her. "The draperies are to be alternately suspended by silver cres





cents and heron-plumes. What do vow think, Miss Montolieu, of the Paradise plume for the centre f" I approachedthe table. "Mr; Bethel, is it possible? how could you leave my lord or his Burgundy so soon? I thank you in the name of the ladies and the tea-urn. Like an ancient conqueror, I perceive you prefer being crowned with the leaf, to being crowned with the fruit. I must sketch a new costume for tea-urns; and instead of this unmeaning tripod, your figure shall be placed above or below it, to intimate the support you lend it."

Lady M. was mercilessinbadinage. I be*licve I was ten minutes in replying: "That they who could retire to her drawingroom, had little merit in the preference." —" That's vastly well; but if you want to make speeches, I beg it may be to the ladies, to whom I have been talking in my sleep for the last half hour, in order to persuade them I was awake. Nothing, is more dreadful than to see a number of unhappy females saying things to each other in that case made and provided. If you will venture on the duty, I am perfectly ready to resign in your favor. Remember to yawn lustily and with a good courage; I believe I shall give you for a watchword. La stupidite." I laughed, and promised to obey orders. I was contented to bear all her wit, to be permitted to look at the lips that uttered it.





"In France," said she, "as Sterne says, they order these matters better; they have a thousand ways of making a man useful or ornamental. Genlis tells a story of an officer who, as Mr. Bethel says, obeyed orders too well; and his female friends ripped all the gold-lace off his regimentals, pour parfiler, and got the only bright thing from him the poor man had to give. If you have got any gold-lace on your coat or on your lining, Mr. B., don't put us to the trouble of ripping it off." I collected courage to observe, that her ladyship's wit was so much more brilliant, that it must eclipse every other effort.





"Tinsel, mere tinsel/' said she, almost with a sigh; "but it does as well for common use. The value of wit, as the jewellers say of plates, depends more on the fashion than the weight; and this light currency saves credit, and gains time, two great points in preventing a bankruptcy of—conversation."

One of the company now ventured on an observation which she had treasured since Lady M.'s first sally, viz. that gentlemen by the rules of fashion were rendered perfectly useless to the ladies. "Pardon, me," said Lady M. fe we were only mistaken formerly with regard to their capacity; it was an error of our grandmothers that men could be made couversible; this we have long abjured. It is melancholy indeed to think how manv unfortunate men were persecuted to death in consequence of it; but since we have found out they are not rational animals, but merely animals of burthen, we have treated them according to their capacity, and given them our ridicules, and parasols, and trains to carry, and it succeeds vastly well. You would hardly believe what progress Lord Roschamp, as bad as he appears, made in learning to carry my train in Kensington-Gardens on his arm."





The ladies laughed at what they could hardly venture to believe; and one of them observed, that such merit in men did not require much judgment, at least, in determining. "Oh, an immensity of judgment—judgment in persons I mean. The Rees, last summer, when she was at Brighton, made poor Sir John bear her ridicule about every day, and every one thought the weight of it would drag him into the Steine." Utterly ignorant of the female world, I observed, like a





wild Irishman'as I was, that her ridicula'was the least supportable burthen a ladj« could impose. "Do you think so," said Lady M. laughing; "Ishall punisl* you for your contumacy, by throwing the whole weight of mine on you for the evening." As she spoke, she took up a small silk bag that lay on the sopha, and flung it sportingly on my arm. She would not have done it, had she known the danger that was in her touch. Had a mountain been heaped upon me, I could have borne it better.

She must have seen it, she took it off my arm. I purposely entangled the strings that I might see her beautifulhands near me longer: "You appear to find the ridicule intolerable," said she "actually, if you were my Lord Lovel's ghost, who has got his own head to carry under his arm, you could not be more out of countenance."

A number of gentlemen now came up y she was instantly surrounded b| Xiord Roschamp and Sir John Orberry, and others, and instantly she assumed the trifler. I retired to where Miss TY1., like a faint star in the neighbourhood of a full bright moon, sat. reading at the extremity of the sopha. She had never opened heflips, or remitted her studies since I saw her. There was something in her silence, her reserve and her apparent alienation from her mother that interested me. I had only -heard her speak once the whole evening; as the ladies left the dining-room, I heard her say m a low voice to Lady Montrevor, "I hope you are well, I believe I have not seen your ladyship since we arrived in Ireland." I knew not how to approach her; Lady M.'s incessant and ambitious blaze of wit, though it repelled all answer, invited approach. But how could a reader be interrupted? As she read, I observed she marked some pages with leaves which she pulled from a rose in her bosom. It was the only object about her, except her eyes and hair that was not of the purest white. The contrast struck- the eye softly, but forcibly. As the door opened, one of the rose-leaves was wafted from the book, and fell. at my feet. I took it up, she received it with the ease of one who was accustomed to attention; and ap<pearing to feel that this was some demand on her attention, said in a low voice, "The impressions this charming author leaves on the mind, are not so fugitive as the marks I endeavoured to fix them by." She held out her book, I looked into it; it was Rousseau's Heloise. I saw it with dread and disgust.





The whole of our library at home consisted of the works of the modern philosophers, and the French writers, who a few years before the revolution, had excited the thirst of outrage and innovation, which could afterwards be only quenehed by blood. When I wished for solid reading, I was presented with Godwin's Political Justice, Mrs. Wolstonecroft's Higbts of Woman, Rousseau's Contrat Social, or Voltaire's Dictionnaire Philosophique. If I wished for lighter reading, I had only Voltaire's or the King of Prussia's bad verses against the Immortality of the Soul, or the insipid and infamous novels of Rousseau, Crebillon, or Diderot. The effect of this persecution on my mind was most revolting and salutary. I could not bear the names of these men; their superficial knowledge, their petulant . scepticism, their sickly and anatomical- sentimentality, their flimsy and inconsequential reasoning, their eternal philosophising on trifles, and treating as trifles all that is important or excellent, or precious to man, either as a rational or social agent, had filled me with an abhorrence which familiarity only increased, and which their popularity never tempted me to conceal. I do not know that my resist* ance to their mischiefs would have been, resolute or effectual, but for my acquaintance with Mr. Corbett. He supplied me with books which refuted them; he furnished me with conversation which refuted them; he exhibited to me a life which refuted them.





Politenessprevented me expressing what I felt at discovering Miss M.'s studies. "My library has not yetarrived," said she; "but in Rousseau I feel every defect supplied."—" I make no doubt of it," said I. "I am, however, expecting the rest every day/' said Miss Montolieu. I breathed a mental wish that they might never arrive. ** They are every one of them French," said the gouvernante advancing; "for I am uncommonly select in the choice of Mademoiselle's studies." I praised her selection as well as I could. "I never wish to read works in any other language," said Miss Montolieu. "C'ett la langue a"amour," said ma

dame, rolling her black full eyes with strong expression. "C'est la langue de beaute," said I, for our whole conversation was in French, bowing to the ladies. Miss Montolieu bowed slightly; but Madame laughed and bowed with the strongest appropriation.

No Frenchwoman can hear a compliment without believing it intended for herself. Heaven knows I was perfectly innocent of the application. Miss Montolieu's graceful declension of merited adulation, her silence, her simplicity, though all appeared the studied effect of a vitiated state of feeling, touched me most forcibly, more forcibly contrasted with the rouge, and loquacity, and glaring maniere of her companion. I was astonished that a woman highly-bred as Lady Montrevor, could be seduced by fashion, into permitting such a female to attend her daughter. But Lady Montrevor

seemed to forget her (laughter and every one else in a whispered conference with Lord Roschamp. He was leaning fearlessly on the lion-fronted arm of her couch. Sometimes he whispered, and sometimes she smiled, as if the objects around them were furnishing the subject of their mirth. At length, after a most violent yawn, "What upon earth," said the peer, "could have driven you to this horrid place ?"—" I protest I can't imagine," said her ladyship; "for you see it neither secures against intrusions nor inquiries.'"—"You can't conceive," said Lord Roschamp, after another violent yawn, "what an amazing splash it made. I never heard any thing tell so famously in my life; and happening just at that time of the year to—damme it gave all London something to talk and think of too the whole season."—" To think of?" repeated Lady M.' "Oh! you are too flattering. I could not have wrought impossibilities."—" But, damme, do you





Inow what, Lady Montrevor," said Sir John Orberry, "some of your friend?, and the Rees among the rest, said it was all an hoax, and that you would blaze out again more amazingly than ever." —" Did they judge from their hopes or their fears?" said Lady M.—rf Oh! damme it was quite a common thing, quite the famous thing to sport a smash. There was Jacobs, the Jew-broker's son, that would have given his father's score of plums to be one of us, and acquire some notoriety. He got himself advertised in all the morning papers, and puffed his stud and curricle, and bets, and mistresses, and every thing he could think of; and, damme. finding nothing would do, at last he advertised a sale, and got himself puffed for a ruined man; and then he was nodded to in Bond-street and Newmarket by some of the knowing ones, and got most astonishing notoriety ki a-week."—" I wonder." said her ladyship, "he did not prefer getting into parliament, to getting into the list of "bankrupts; he must have been notorious there in a much shorter time, either for ability or deficiency—as you my lord could inform him."—" And there was the great nabob's dowager, I have forgot her name; but she never took famously till she was quite ruined. It is the rage I can assure you. Lady M. quite the rage upon my soul. Not a creature would go to her while it was known she could afford the amazing suppers she gave; but her rooms were crowded when every one knew there was to be an execution in them. It was most amazingly famous her last explosion: d'ye remember Orberry ?"—" Oh ! upon my soul, I always patronized the dowager, that is, tolerated her and her suppers, I mean. I taught her how to part with a few lacks of her superfluous rupees, though, damme, it was as much as I could do to sit opposite





her when she was losing, and keep my countenance. There was a staring and sallow despair in her broad face that was quite intolerable. Damme, if she was not exactly like that bronze sphinx on the tripod there, with her fixed eyes, and her burnished skin—quite bronze upon my soul."—" Quite bronze," repeated Lady Montrevor; "but you did not discover that till you had taken off all her gilding."

The incorrigibles laughed. Sir John' strolled off to hedge in a bet against my father, whom he conceived to be the flat, in a game of picquet he had just commenced with Lord Montrevor. In this, however, he was mistaken; my, father, who played with the judgment of a veteran, won considerably; and it was diverting to see the rueful surprise with which he parted with his money, contrasted with the courtly bows and commendations with which Lord Montrevor,





-who always possessed himself, greeted his antagonist's skill and success.

Lord Roschamp was in the mean time importuning Lady M. to touch her harp; she trifled with his importunity, but when I faulteringly joined in the request, she ordered the harp to be brought. "My harp has hung so long onthewillows in thisland of banishment/' Said she, "that I believe it has forgot itself to silence."

I will not describe the attitude she assumed, placing herself at it, nor the wayward and capricious graces with which she Waved her arms, while affecting to be impatient at the delay in tuning it. She was one whom '* every thing became:" to be proud, fastidious, fantastic, seemed in her only the excess of feeling, the frolic of luxuriance. I cannot describe her attitudes for in a short time, T wished to have no sense but thai bf hearing. The effect of perhaps the first singer of the age, on an ear which had yet possessed a sensibility of pleasure it had never experienced, may easily be left to imagination. Here were not the whispered tones and imitative manner of a private performer; the influence of her character extended to her musical taste. Careless of pleasing, she was secure of admiration, and content to be admired, and the liquid chirrup and birdlike execution of her voice in high and rapid" passages, was quite the supernatural of the art.





Her powers had been acquired or formed during a long residence in Italy. Music was the only thing she ever would acknowledge she had studied. She never sung any music but Italian, of English music she spoke with ludicrous contempt, and of Irish, till she heard it. Pleased with my ardent and unhackneyed admiration, she called on Miss M. to accompany her in some duets. They who "have, ever listened to music •N





from the half-open, quivering lip of beauty may guess my feelings. She was an enchantress formed for delight and destruction.. The cards were now universally forsaken; those who had musical feeling, were richly recompensed, and those who had not listened that they might be able to tell others that they had heard Lady M. sing^ In the midst of a-notewhich she was permitting to die away, till the, ear seemed to lose its power in the pleasure of following it, she suddenly stopped, declaring, that it was always better to stop when she was tired herself, than to wait tilLothers were tired, and nopersuasions could induce her to renew her song. The card-players retired in some confusion, Lady M. expressing her regret for the disturbance, and her hope that they had all* committed the state of the game to writing, before they had left their tables, as they would find it . more profitable, than "marking the musick," as Lorenzo says. "You can't

I i





conceive how much time and admiration you have been throwing away/' said Lady M.—" Musie is quite passe now as I found it to my loss after purchasing that superb-harp, just as all the world allowed I was equal or superior to Gabrielli, in caprice at least. The deity of caprice in the form of a certain Duchess, voted dancing to he quite the fashionable thing, and instantly every one with or without ears or legs began dancing. I would not yield to this tarantula-fit. I announced a concert for every ball of the enemy. The contest was terrible. All the morning papers amused themselves, and the town, conjecturing whether the Duchess would be compelled to withdraw her steps, or Lady Westhampton to change her notes. I am sure the paragraphs were furnished by my femme de chambre, they are exactly the quaintnesses of Bennet. At last, a kind of hollow Amiens treaty of peace was patched up by some common friends: we met on a kind of mutual





ground. She told the guarantees shewould sit out my concerts, and I told them I would walkthrough her balls, and so we danced for a couple of winters, like the sun and moon in the rehearsal, to eclipse each other, till my "total eclipse," which has left room for any other body to interpose that possesses sufficient magnitude or attraction." "Upon my soul L was at the most famous thing given in London since you left it, at the Duchess's, about three weeks ago; quite an amazing thing, the most knowing style, all' the rooms by tlie first artists, done ali. with' lamps and flowers and paintings. They told me all about it, for there was a kind of Ciceroni that was to tell avery body when they went from the Elysian Fields to the Deserts of Arabia:" I dare say the information was quite rrecessary," said Lady Montrevor. 'c But v\ hat struckme most was the Turkish llaram and her Grace as the fair Fatima." "Are you positive," said Lady Montrevor, "that it 'was not the infernal regions, and her -Grace as the principal ' fury?" "Upon 'my soul she might/' said the describer weary of questions, he did not understand, "for ought I know to the contrary." *' Or I either/' said Lady M. with sarcastic emphasis. "lJut Orberry, why the devil you who are so amazingly astonishing at descriptions, why don't yoa tell Lady Montrevor of the Duchess last fete." "Duchess?" said the baronet, "Damme, it was an hollow thing in Duchess's favor for the first mile, then the bets inclined." A general laugh completely awokehim.. "Why what the devil Orberry, damme but I believe you were asleep." Upon my soul I believe' I was. Her ladyship's singing in that heavenly sort of manner, always puts me to sleep." "Don't he at all surprized," said Lady M. "Caliban says just as much of himself/' "I feel I have had an amazing loss," said the baronet. "A bagatelle on both sides," said her lady





ship, "you lost my song, and I lost your praises, and I beg you will endeavour to think as little of your loss as I do of mine." "Mais allons," said she, throwing herself back on the couch. "Sir John's somnolency is infectious, draw the priestess of indolence back to her temple, mcs fils," we replaced the couch in the recess. "Thank you, I shall not imprecate the same blessing on you, that she did on her bearers, for I shall want you to live to draw me out again, to wish the company bon soir whenever they please to allow me one." The company were now separating, when supper was announced. Lady M. did not appear at it. I lingered in the drawing room till the last had quitted it. I. was the last who saw her. I thought she waved her hand to me. i
